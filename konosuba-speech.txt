Satou Kazuma-san, welcome to the afterlife. Unfortunately, you’ve died. It might’ve been short, but your life’s now over.
… May I ask one thing?
Please, go ahead.
… The girl that was knocked away by me, is she still alive?
She lives! But she fractured her leg.
But, she wouldn’t have been hurt if you hadn’t knocked her away.
… Huh?
The tractor would’ve stopped before hitting the girl. I mean, it was just a slow tractor after all. That means that your unnecessary meddling by acting like a hero made things worse… Puhehe!
… What’d you say? A tractor? Not a truck?
That’s right, a tractor. If a truck had been speeding toward that girl, she would’ve noticed it and gotten away.
Eh, but what about me? Did I die after getting hit by the tractor?
No, you died from shock. You thought you were ran over by a truck and went into shock. I’ve been doing this for a long time, but you’re the first to die in such a hilarious way!
Because of your close call with the tractor, you lost consciousness and control of your bowels, and you were sent to a nearby hospital. As the doctors and nurses were laughing and saying, ‘What’s with this guy, how useless–’, you didn’t regain consciousness and your heart failed.
Shut up–! I don’t want to hear it! I don’t want to hear something so humiliating!
Your family reached the hospital, but before they could feel the sadness from their loss, they couldn’t help but burst into laughter upon hearing your cause of death.
Shut up, shut up! This can’t be real! How can there be such a useless way to die? This is unbelievable!
… Well, that ends my de-stressing session. This is our first meeting, Satou Kazuma-san. My name’s Aqua. I’m a goddess that guides young people who die in Japan. Now, putting aside how funny your demise was, you now have two options.
The first option would be reincarnating and beginning a new life; the other option would be staying in a place sort of like heaven and living the life of a retirement home.
Eh, well, how’s the place that’s sort of like heaven? More importantly, what do you mean by ‘retirement home’?
Heaven isn’t as great as you humans would imagine. You don’t need to eat after dying and won’t be able to make any food naturally; there aren’t any ingredients nor necessities for you to use anyway. I’m sorry if I disappointed you, but there’s nothing in heaven. No television, no manga and no games. Only other people that’ve died before you. Moreover, since you’re dead, you can’t do anything kinky. You can’t since you don’t even have a body. The only thing you can do is bask in the sun with your predecessors and chat. Forever.
Hey… You don’t want to go to a boring place like heaven, right? However, asking you to let go of all of your memories and start again as a baby’s the same as erasing your existence, since your memories will be gone. And so, I’ve great news for you!
Do you like games?
The people who died in that world were killed by the Demon King’s army and were very afraid, saying that they didn’t want to die like that again. Therefore, almost all of the people who died rejected reincarnating in that world again. More specifically, that world will end if this continues since babies will cease to be born there. Hence, we’ll solve that problem by sending the dead from other worlds over, right? That’s how it is.
And since we’re sending people over, we should find people that’ve died young and still yearn to live and send them over with their original body and memories. It’ll be meaningless if they were to die immediately after going over, so we’ll grant a privilege to all of those going to that world, allowing them to take one thing they like. It may be a powerful ability, an exceptional talent or a god-level weapon. What do you think? It might be another world, but you can live once more. For the people of that world, someone will appear who can fight immediately. How about it? Isn’t this great news?
Um, I have a question, what about the language? Will I be able to speak the language of the other world?
This isn’t a problem. With the gentle aid of the gods, knowledge of the language will be beamed directly into your brain the moment you head over to the other world. You’ll even be able to read! As a side effect, your brain might be wiped blank if you’re unlucky… Anyway, all that’s left is to choose a powerful ability or weapon.
Hold on, I heard something important just now. Did you say my brain might be wiped blank if I’m unlucky?
I didn’t say that.
You did.
Please choose. I may grant you one and only one power. It may be a powerful unique ability, or perhaps a legendary weapon. Come, it can be anything. You have the privilege to bring this one thing to the other world.
Hey, hurry up. It doesn’t matter which one you choose, nobody’s expecting much of a hikikomori gaming otaku. Can you just pick one and be on your way? Anything will do. Hurry up, hurry up…
I-I’m not an otaku…! And I died outside, so I’m not a hikikomori…!
It doesn’t matter, just hurry up and choose. There are still many dead souls waiting in line!
… Okay, I choose you!
Ah, okay, please stand there and don’t move out of the magic circle…
… What’d you just say?
I understand. Well then, I’ll take over Aqua-sama’s job from now on.
… Eh?
Wait…! Huh, what’s happening? Eh, you can’t be serious! No! No…! Hold on! This is too weird! Isn’t it cheating to bring a goddess along? This shouldn’t count! Wait! Wait, okay?
Have a safe trip, Aqua-sama. Please leave the rest to me. We’ll send envoys to welcome you back right after the Demon King’s defeated. Before you return, I’ll handle all of your tasks.
Wait! Wait! I may have the ability to heal as a goddess, but I have no combat ability to speak of! It’s impossible for me to defeat the Demon King!
Satou Kazuma-san, you’ll be heading to another world now and will become one of the hero candidates to defeat the Demon King. You’ll receive a gift from the gods the moment you defeat the Demon King.
… Gift?
That’s right, a gift befitting the saviour of the world… You’ll be granted a wish; it may be anything you want.
Oh!
Wait! Giving that cool speech is my job!
How does it feel to be companions with a man you look down on? Hey, you’re the ‘thing’ I’ve chosen to bring along! Since you’re a goddess, use your godly powers to make my adventure a breeze!
No! Going to another world with a man like this, no way…!
Hero, may you be victorious among the many hero candidates and be the one to defeat the Demon King…! Well then, I bid you farewell!
Wah! That’s my line!
…Another world… Hey, it really is another world. Eh, it’s for real. Am I going to use magic and go on adventures in this world?
AHHH! …AHHH…!
Animal ears! There’s someone with animal ears! Elf ears! Is that an elf? With such striking facial features, she definitely has to be one! Goodbye hikikomori life! Hello different world! If it’s this world, then I’m willing to go out and work obediently!
AHHH! …AHHH! …AHHH…!
Hey, you’re noisy. What would you do if people think I’m friends with a crazy woman like you? Stop screaming. You should be giving something to me at a time like this. Look at what I’m wearing. A tracksuit? I’ve finally arrived in a fantasy world and I’m wearing a tracksuit. According to the norm in games, you should be giving me the minimum equipment…
AHHH–!
Whoa! What…? What are you doing, don’t act this way! I get it! I’ll do something about the basic equipment. I should say that I was wrong. If you hate it that much, you can go back. I’ll work out the rest on my own.
What are you saying? I’m troubled because I can’t go back! What now? Hey, what should I do? What am I going to do from now on?
Hey, calm down, goddess, the first place to visit should be the tavern. Everything starts from collecting information at a tavern, that’s the standard in RPGs.
Huh…? You’re supposed to be just a hikikomori-gaming NEET,  so why are you so reliable? Ah, Kazuma, my name’s Aqua. I don’t mind you addressing me as goddess, but do call me by my name whenever possible or else citizens will surround us and we won’t be able to go on adventures and take down the Demon King. This might be a different world, but I’m still one of the revered gods in it.
Aqua, please tell me where the adventurer’s guild is. Which way should we go?
…? I wouldn’t know even if you ask me. I know the common knowledge of this world, but not the specifics of this town. This is just one of the many existing planets, and just a small town at that! How should I know?
Excuse me–may I ask you something? I’m looking for a place like an adventurer’s guild…
Guild? Oh my, to not know where the guild is, might you be from out of town?
That’s right; I’m a traveller who came from a faraway land. I just reached this town.
Oh my… Since you came to this town, you must be aiming to become an adventurer. Welcome to the town of novice adventurers, Axel. Follow the main road and turn right, you’ll then see the signboard for the guild.
Take a right down the road. Got it, thank you very much! … Hey, let’s go.
Hey, you came up with an excuse right on the spot. Why are you able to handle this so perfectly? You seem to be a capable guy, so why were you a hikiNEET without any friends or a girlfriend? Why would you want to stay at home all day and be a hikiNEET?
Not having friends or a girlfriend isn’t a bad thing. One can’t measure the value of a person by the number of friends or by having a significant other. Moreover, don’t call me a hikiNEET you damn bitch! Don’t combine hikikomori and NEET together…! I’m just sixteen; I’m too young to be a NEET by society’s standards…! There it is.
Ah, welcome. Please approach the counter if you’re looking for quests. If you’re here to dine, then please take any empty seat…!
Hey, they’re looking this way too blatantly. It must be the holy aura coming from me; they must’ve discovered that I’m a goddess.
… Listen carefully, Aqua… They’ll give us a tutorial if we register, enabling us to earn a living; that’s the kind of place adventurer guilds are. We should be able to take out a loan to prepare ourselves, complete simple jobs to get by and introduce ourselves to a good tavern. Most games start out this way. Normally, preparing the minimum essentials to live in this world should be your job, but never mind that. For today, let’s register with the guild, get some equipment and money, and find a place to sleep.
I don’t care about that. My job’s sending the dead to this world, but I get it. I’m not familiar with games, but what you said seems to be common sense for this world. So I just need to register to be an adventurer too, right?
That’s right. All right then, let’s go.
… Hey, the other three counters are empty. Why are you queuing here? We won’t have to wait if we go to another counter… Ah, because this counter worker’s the prettiest, huh? Really, I was a bit impressed and thought that you were reliable just now, but you’re really doing this?
Building a good rapport with the guild’s counter staff are the basics, and the pretty counter lady definitely has plenty of flags to raise. This means that there’ll be more shocking hidden side quests waiting for us. For example, the counter lady might be a powerful adventurer or something.
… Now that you mention it, I saw something similar in a manga. Sorry, I’ll wait in line obediently.
Good morning, how may I help you?
Eh, I want to become an adventurer. I come from the countryside and don’t know anything…
I see. There’ll be a registration fee, will that be okay?
… Hey Aqua, got any cash on you?
I was transported here suddenly, so how would it be possible for me to have any money?
… Hey, what now? We’re in a pinch right from the beginning. In games, you’ll normally get starting equipment, as well as some money for living expenses.
You suddenly become unreliable. However, there’s no helping it, since you’re a hikikomori after all. All right, it’s time for me to shine. Just watch, I’ll show you the capability of a goddess.
Man of the cloth, please state thy religion! I’m Aqua. That’s right, the goddess Aqua worshipped by the religious order of Axis! If thou art a believer…! … May you give me some aid by lending me some money?
… I’m from the Eris Sect.
Ah… I see, sorry…
Ah… Madam, you must be a follower of Axis. There were stories about Goddess Aqua and Goddess Eris being close, so this must be fate. I’ve been observing you. Might you be having trouble paying the registration fee? It’s just a small fee, so please take it as a blessing from Goddess Eris. But no matter how devout you are, you shouldn’t use the title of goddess in vain.
Ah… Okay, sorry… Thank you very much…
Ha, he didn’t believe that I’m a goddess… By the way, Goddess Eris’s my junior. I was pitied by the believer of my junior goddess and received his money…
What matters is that you completed the task. Think about it. If he really believed that you were a goddess, there’d be a different kind of trouble!
Eh, we’re back with the registration fees.
I… I see… The registration fee is 1,000 eris…
All right. Since you said you want to become an adventurer, you should have some level of understanding, but I’ll explain it from the start… First, adventurers are responsible for the extermination of monsters wandering outside the town, people who get rid of dangerous creatures that might harm the citizens. They’re also jacks-of-all-trades, taking on odd jobs that require their talents. Collectively known as adventurers are people who earn a living this way. And among adventurers, there are different jobs.
Experience Points are normally intangible things, but…
With this card, the Experience Points the adventurer absorbs will be shown here. At the same time, the level corresponding to your experience points will be displayed here. This shows how strong an adventurer is. How many enemies you defeat will be recorded here. With the accumulation of experience points, all creatures will grow stronger rapidly at some point, known as leveling up. Simply put, leveling up will grant you all sorts of benefits, such as skill points to learn new skills. So please work hard to increase your level.
Do you like games?
First, please fill in your height, weight, age and other details in the blanks.
That’ll be fine, please touch this card. This will display the strength of each of your abilities for reference when choosing your job. After accumulating skill points, you can learn skills that are available for your job. This is one of the key points in choosing occupations.
… All right, thank you. Satou Kazuma-san, right? Let’s see… Strength, vitality, magic, agility and speed… All of them are average. Intelligence is slightly better than average… Huh? Luck’s very high, but it’s not very relevant for adventurers… This is troubling. From the numbers, you can only choose the most basic Adventurer job! Since your luck’s so high, I suggest you give up being an adventurer and be a merchant instead… What’ll you like to do?
Um… I’d like to become an Adventurer…
I-It’s fine. After levelling up and raising your stats, you can change your job! In addition, the Adventurer job is just what it sounds like; it’s a combination of all jobs. That’s right, it might be a basic level job, but it doesn’t mean it’s worse than the others! Adventurers can learn and use the skills of all jobs after all!
On the other hand, you’ll need more skill points to learn skills. Without the bonus attribute of the actual job, your skills will be weaker when compared to them. It’s a jack of all trades, master of none.
Eh? Huh? What’s with these numbers? Leaving the lower than average intelligence and rock bottom luck aside, the rest of your stats drastically exceed the average! Especially your magic, it’s abnormally high! Who in the world are you…?
Ah, is that right? Therefore, it means I’m amazing. Oh my, it’s normal by my standard.
This… This is way beyond amazing! Mage-type jobs that require high intelligence aren’t available… However, you may choose any other job! The holy knight with its strongest defense, Crusader; the swordsman with the strongest attack, Sword Master; and the top-tier cleric, Archpriest. You may choose from most of the top-tier jobs right now!
Well, it’s a pity that goddess isn’t available as a job. It’ll be Archpriest for me then.
Archpriest! Archpriests can use all kinds of recovery and support spells. They can even take the role of vanguards, a strong all-rounder job! I’ll register you now… Done. Welcome to the adventurer’s guild, Aqua-sama! All of our staff look forward to your grand exploits!
All right, good work everyone–! That’s it for today! Here, this is today’s salary.
Thank you! Good job today, boss–!
Good job–!
Everyone, we’ll make a move first–!
Goodbye–!
Oh–thanks for your hard work! I’m counting on you tomorrow too.
Ah, I’m alive again…
What would you like to eat today? I want some smoked-lizard hamburger steak and the heart-freezing crimson Neroid!
I want to eat meat too, so let’s go to the tavern and get two smoked-lizard steak set meals.
Agreed!
Well then, good night.
Good night.Phew… I worked hard today too…
No, wait a minute!
What is it? Did you forget to go to the washroom? It’s dark out there; do you need me to accompany you?
No way! Hold on, it’s not that. I just realized that we’ve been living the life of manual labourers so far.
You don’t work, you don’t eat, isn’t that obvious? HikiNEETs are fussy. If you prefer to, you can work as a store clerk too!
No! It’s not that. How should I put this? What I’m after is exciting battles against monsters! A life like that! Moreover, isn’t this world in a crisis with the invasion of the Demon King? Isn’t it amazingly peaceful here? There are no signs of demons at all!
Hey, can it! Be quiet!
Ah, sorry!
It’s useless even if you tell me these things. This is the town furthest away from the Demon King’s castle after all! Who would come all the way to attack a town of beginners at the borders…? Anyway… Kazuma wants to live more like an adventurer, right? You don’t even have the proper equipment!
I’m getting bored of construction too. I didn’t come to this world to be a labourer; I came to this world with no computers and games to adventure. And didn’t you send me here to challenge the Demon King?
Oh! There was such a thing! I forgot, immersed in the happiness of working. I can’t go back if Kazuma doesn’t defeat the Demon King.
All right, let’s go challenge the Demon King! Don’t worry; it’ll be a breeze with me here! Look forward to my performance!
That makes me uneasy… However, you’re a goddess after all, so I’m counting on you! Okay, we’ll buy some basic weapons and armor with the money we saved and go grinding tomorrow!
Leave it to me!
Didn’t I tell you two to can it? Do you want me to beat you up?
I’m very sorry!
Ah! Help! Aqua, save me…!
Puhehe! This is hilarious! Kazuma, your face is all red and you have tears in your eyes! You look really desperate!
Aqua–! Aqua–! Stop laughing and save me–!
For starters, add a ‘-san’ when you address me.
Aqua-sama–!
Can’t be helped–! All right, I’ll save you, hikiNEET! However, you’ll need to worship this goddess from tomorrow onward! You’ll have to join the Aqua sect in town and pray to me three times a day! You can’t object if I take any side dishes from you during meals! In addition… Ugh?
Aqua–! You…! How could you get eaten–?
Sob… Ugh, ugh– WAHHH…!
Ugh…Sob… Thank, thank you… Kazuma, thank you…! WAHHH…!
Are… Are you okay, Aqua? Be strong… Let’s go back for today. The quest we took on was exterminating five frogs in three days, but they weren’t opponents we could handle. Let’s try again when we’ve got better equipment. Look, I only have a short sword, no armor, and I’m still wearing my tracksuit. Let’s come back when we’re dressed more like adventurers.
Ugh… For a goddess like me to be humiliated by a frog; how can we retreat? I’m already defiled. If a believer sees how dirty I am… Their faith will most certainly plummet! If people knew that I ran from frogs, it’d be a disgrace to the name of the beautiful Goddess Aqua!
Ah! Hey, hold up, Aqua!
Feel the wrath of a goddess! You dare to oppose a goddess!? Repent in hell! God Blow!
… Looking closely… frogs are actually quite cute, right?
I get it. Just us two isn’t enough, so let’s recruit more members!
But… Even if we want to recruit comrades, do you think anyone would want to team up with novices like us who don’t even have proper equipment?
Wiff mi hare, I juice node…
Swallow. Swallow before you speak.
With me here, I just need to holler and people will line up to join us. I’m an Archpriest after all, a top-tier job! I can use all sorts of healing spells and support magic, and I can relieve poison and paralysis statuses. I can even perform resurrection, a talent any team would want. I might’ve fallen into the mortal world, causing my powers to be far from my peak, but I’m still a goddess… Ahem! I’m Aqua-sama after all! I just need to put up a notice and a bunch of people begging me to ‘bring me along on quests’ will show up! If you understand, then give me another piece of fried frog meat!
… No one’s coming…
… Hey, let’s lower our standard. Our goal’s to defeat the Demon King, so such conditions were necessary… However, ‘only recruiting top-tier jobs’ is a bit too gruelling.
Ugh… But…
If this goes on, no one will apply! You might have a top-tier job, but mine’s the weakest. I’ll lose my place if elites suddenly surround me. How about lowering the entry requirements…?
I saw the notice recruiting  adventurers with top-tiers jobs. Are you the ones who posted it?
My name is Megumin! My calling is that of an Archwizard, and one who controls the strongest offensive magic, Explosion…!
…Are you here to tease us?
I-I’m not!
That red eye, are you a Crimson Demon?
That’s correct! I’m an elite mage from the Crimson Demon Clan, Megumin! My magic’s powerful enough to split the mountains…! … That’s how it is. Do you need an excellent mage? … By the way, I’ve a favour to ask. I haven’t eaten in three days; may you give me something to eat before the interview…?
… I’m fine with treating you to a meal, but why are you wearing an eyepatch? If you’re injured, do you need this girl to heal you?
Oh… So it’s something like a seal?
I made that up. This is just a normal eyepatch. It just looks nice… Ah, sorry… Please don’t pull on that, stop!
Eh… Listen Kazuma, Crimson Demons are born with high intellect and strong magic power, with most of them having the potential to become powerful mages. They’re well known for their red eyes and their strange names.
It’s rude to say that our names are weird. From where I stand, the names of the people in this town are the weird ones.
… Right, may I ask for your parents’ names?
My mother’s Yuiyui, and my father’s Hyoizaburo.
… Anyway, this girl’s race produces many powerful mages, right? Could we recruit her as a companion?
Hey, if you’ve got a problem with the names of my parents, say it to my face!
It should be fine, right? The adventurer’s card is real; she has a  top-tier job with the ability to use powerful spells–Archwizard. The magic stat on the card’s very high, so she has a lot of potential. If she really can use explosion magic, that would be amazing! The explosion spell’s the highest-tier spell of the detonation-series magic and is hard to learn.
Hey! Stop addressing me as she, use my name!
Don’t mind the details, order something to eat. My name’s Kazuma, and this is Aqua. Pleased to meet you, Archwizard.
Explosion’s the strongest offensive spell. On the other hand, it has a long casting time. Please keep that frog at bay until I’m ready.
Please target the frog further away. As for the nearer one… Hey, let’s go, Aqua. We’ll avenge ourselves this time. You’re a former goddess, right? How about showing what you’re made of?
What do you mean by ‘former’? I’m a current goddess! My position of an Archpriest’s just a disguise!
… Goddess?
… Just a pitiful woman claiming to be a goddess. She’ll say stuff like this from time to time, so please don’t mind her.
You’re just frogs that are strong against physical attacks! Let me show you the power of a goddess! Kazuma, watch this carefully! I haven’t done anything great yet, but I’ll definitely succeed today!
Watch closely; this is the strongest attack spell known to humans… The ultimate attack spell.
Explosion!
… Amazing–so this is magic.
Megumin! Let’s retreat for now and attack from a distance…!
Humph… Explosion’s my ultimate spell. It’s powerful and uses a lot of mana. Simply put, the mana I used exceeded my limit, so I can’t move. Ah, to think that a frog would appear out of nowhere… No good, I’ll be eaten. Sorry, please save me. Hya…!
Ugh… Ugh…Sniff… It smells… It smells like fish…
It’s smelly inside the frog, but the warm feeling isn’t too bad… I gained some knowledge that I’d rather not know…
From now on, explosion magic’s banned unless there’s an emergency. Please get by with your other spells from now on, Megumin.
… I can’t.
… Huh? You can’t what?
… I can only use Explosion; I don’t know any other magic.
… Are you serious?
… Yes.
What do you mean you only know Explosion? If you had enough skill points to learn Explosion, you must’ve learned other spells, right?
Skill points are something you earn when you choose a job; it’s used to learn skills. The more potential a person has, the more skill points they start out with. You can learn all sorts of skills by investing skill points in them. For example, the excellent me has learned all the banquet party tricks as well as all the spells of an Archpriest.
… Where are you going to use banquet party tricks?
Depending on the person and the job, there are restrictions to the skills they may learn. For example, someone with a fear of water would need more points to learn water or ice elemental spells… However, as detonation-series magic consists of composite spells, you’d need deep knowledge of fire and wind magic to master it. This means that people who can learn detonation magic should be able to easily learn other spells.
This means that it doesn’t make sense to be unable to learn low-tier spells when you know high-tier magic from the detonation-series… Anyway, where can you make use of banquet party tricks?
… I’m an Archwizard that loves Explosion. What I like is not detonation-series magic, but Explosion.
Adventures will definitely be easier if I learn other spells. Fire, water, earth, wind and light… Learning spells related to this should be good enough… However, I couldn’t do it; my only love is Explosion. Even though I can only cast it once per day, even if I’ll collapse after using the spell, my one true love is still Explosion! The only reason I chose the path of the Archwizard was to cast explosion spells.
Incredible! Great! Your resolve to follow your romantic dreams despite knowing it’s inefficient really moved me!
I see. I think this will be a difficult path, so do work hard. Ah, I can see the town. Let’s divide the rewards equally at the guild. Yes, let’s meet again if our paths cross once more.
Humph… My only wish is to use explosion magic; the bounty’s just a complementary bonus. How about this: I don’t need an even share of the rewards. If you’re willing to foot the bill for food, bath and miscellaneous items, I can consider not taking any rewards. That’s right, my power as an Archwizard is available at the price of meals and other miscellaneous fees! How could you miss this opportunity to form a long-term contract?
No, no, no, our weak team isn’t worthy of such amazing power. That’s right, it’s too much to ask Megumin to stay in our team with your amazing powers. A team just starting out should make do with a normal mage. Look at me, my job’s even the weakest one, Adventurer.
No, no, no, it doesn’t matter if you’re novices or weak. I might have a top-tier job, but I’m still a beginner too. My level’s just six. When my level grows, I won’t collapse after using my spells. So let’s talk this over, and then you may pull my hand away, okay?
No, no, no, it’s too hard to utilize a mage that can only cast one spell a day. Ugh, she’s a mage but her grip’s strong…! Let go, the other teams probably didn’t want you either. Or rather, one can’t use explosion spells in dungeons or indoors, which would render you useless. Hey, release your grip! I’ll split the rewards equally with you, so please let go!
Please don’t ditch me! No team’s willing to take me! I’m willing to carry the luggage or anything when exploring dungeons, so please don’t throw me away!
– No way, that man wants to abandon that child…
– He has a girl covered in slime with him.
– To toy with such a small child and to abandon her after that, what trash. Look, why is there goo covering the girls? What weird sexual games did that pervert make them do?
I’m fine with any sort of play! Even using the frog’s slime just like now is okay…
All right–I get it! Megumin, I’ll be in your care!
All right, everything’s in order. I’ve confirmed that your team has finished the quest of defeating 5 giant frogs in 3 days. Good work.
… But, I can really get stronger just by killing monsters…
Well then, turning in 2 giant frogs, in addition to receiving the bounty for completing the quest, comes to a total of 110,000 eris. Please take this.
… Excuse me, may I ask…?
Is something the matter…?
Ah, eh–what’s the matter?
Um… The team that put up this recruitment notice was you, right? Are you still looking for people?
Oh–we’re still hiring. Although I wouldn’t recommend you joining…
Please pick me! Please let me join your party!
No, no, no, hold up. Our party has plenty of problems; the other two members are burdens and my job’s the weakest. Because of that, my two companions were covered in slime… Ow! Ow! Ow!
I was right, those two covered in goo were your comrades! What happened, how’d they end up like that…!? I-I also…! Want to experience that…!
Huh?
No, I phrased it wrongly. For the two young girls to experience that at such a tender age… as a knight, I can’t stand by and watch. My job’s the top-tier Crusader, so it should fit your recruitment criteria.
Ara–I didn’t finish. I really don’t recommend you joining. One of our party members is useless, the other can only cast one spell a day and I have the weakest job. That’s the lame party this is, so I suggest you find another…?
That’s perfect! To be honest, I’m confident in my strength and durability, but I’m not too agile with my hands… So I can’t hit the enemy…
So you don’t need to treat me as having a top-tier job; I’ll just charge ahead without a care, so abuse me like a shield.
No, how can I let a girl act like a shield? My party’s super weak, so the attacks will really hit you. The monsters might gang up on you in every fight!
That’s the way I like it!
No, how should I put this…? My two companions were eaten by frogs and covered in slime! This might happen every day!
That’s exactly what I want!
Hey, there’s something I want to ask the both of you. How do you learn skills?
Learning skills? That’s easy, look at your card and choose one from the ‘Learnable skills’ column… Oh right, Kazuma’s job’s Adventurer. In that case, you need someone to teach you a skill. You need to see the skill in action and ask the user to teach you how to use it. It’ll then show up in the learnable column, then you can spend skill points to learn the skill.
… That means if Megumin teaches me, I could use explosion magic?
Yeah, exactly!
Whoa!
That’s right, Kazuma! The skill points needed would be absurdly high, but Adventurer is the only job other than Archwizard that can use Explosion. I can teach you if you want to learn. Or rather, there are no other skills that are worth learning except Explosion, right? Of course not! Come, let’s walk the path of Explosion together!
Wait, calm down loli! I only have 3 skill points, there’s no way I can learn it, right?
L-Loli…?
If an adventurer wants to learn the explosion spell, 20 or so skill points won’t be enough. You’ll probably need to train for a decade or two and invest all your points to learn it.
Who has that kind of patience?
Fu… To call me a loli…
Hey Aqua, you should have many convenient skills, right? Do you have any easy-to-learn skills to teach me? I prefer those that don’t need a lot of points and are very useful.
… It can’t be helped–but I have to warn you, my skills are amazing! They’re not meant to be passed on lightly!
Well, look at this cup. Put this cupful of water on top of your head and don’t let it fall off. Here, try it.
All right. Now use your finger to flick the seed into the cup; you must do it in one try. Something amazing is happening! The seed’s absorbing the water and sprouting…
Who asked you to teach me party tricks, you worthless goddess!?
Eh–?
Ha! That’s hilarious! Hey, you’re the party Darkness wanted to join, right? You want to learn something useful? How about Thief skills?
Um, what do you mean by Thief skills? How are they like?
Good question. Thief skills are very practical–such as Disarm Traps, Enemy Detection, Lurk and Steal. They’re all skills that are worth learning. Your job’s the basic-tier Adventurer, right? Thief skills don’t require many points, so it’s a great offer! How about it? I’ll teach them to you for the price of a glass of crimson beer!
Okay, I’ll leave it in your hands! Excuse me, a glass of ice-cold crimson beer for this lady please!
Right, let me properly introduce myself. I’m Chris. As you can see, I’m a Thief. And this person with a moody face is Darkness. You met yesterday, right? She’s a Crusader and shouldn’t have any skills that are useful to you.
Hello! I’m Kazuma. Nice to meet you, Chris!
Well then, we’ll start with Enemy Detection and Lurk. We’ll work on Disarm Traps next time, since traps are rare in such a crowded place. Hey Darkness, could you turn over there for a moment?
… Hmm? … Okay.
Sensing enemy… Sensing enemy… I can strongly feel Darkness’s anger! Hey, Darkness? You know I only did that to teach him the skills, I couldn’t help it! Please have mercy… Ahhh, stop! Ahhh!
All right. Let’s try the skill I recommend the most, Steal. This is a skill that can snatch away one item possessed by the target. It can be anything, be it the weapon gripped tightly in their hands or the wallet secured deep in their pockets.The probability of success is dependent on the luck stat. You can take the weapon or treasure of a strong enemy and run, so it’s a great skill to have under any circumstances.
I’ll demonstrate with you as the target! Ready, Steal!
Ah! That’s my wallet!
Oh! Jackpot! It’s used this way. Well of course, I’ll give the wallet back…
… Hey… Let’s have a match, all right? Try learning Steal now. I’ll then let you steal one item from me. I won’t complain even if you steal my wallet or weapon. Your wallet’s so thin that my weapon or wallet will be more valuable. That means we’ll be trading in whatever items that are stolen… How about it? Want to try?
I’ve learned the skill and I accept your challenge! Don’t come crying to me no matter what I steal!
That’s great! I like people who aren’t spoilsports! All right then, what can you steal? The special prize will be my wallet! The grand prize will be this enchanted dagger! This is a great item worth 400,000 eris! The consolation prize will be this piece of rock I threw at Darkness!
Ah! Using such a method is cheating!
This is my teaching fee. As you can see, no skills are all powerful. You learned something great, right? All right, give it a go!
All right, watch this! My luck has always been good! Steal!
… What’s this?
Yahoo–! It’s the grand prize, and it’s a big one–!
No–! Give me back my panties–!
Aqua-sama, one more time! I’m willing to pay for it, so could you perform Nature’s Beauty once more?
Fool, Aqua-san prefers food instead of money! Right, Aqua-san? I’ll treat you to a meal, so please do Nature’s Beauty again!
My performances aren’t things that can be performed whenever they’re requested! A great man once said that ‘a funny joke can only be told once’. Doing the same tricks repeatedly because they’re popular means you’re a third-rate performer! And I’m not a performer, so I won’t accept money for my performance! This should be the basic attitude of a performance artisan. And I didn’t perform Nature’s Beauty for you to see– Ah! Kazuma, you’re finally back. It turned out like this because of you… By the way, what’s with her?
Chris’s panties were removed by Kazuma, and then she lost all her money to him. That’s why she’s feeling down.
Hey, what’s this nonsense!? Hold up. Well, you’re not wrong, but hold on a minute.
Even if I was stripped of my panties in public, I can’t keep on crying! All right, Darkness. I’m sorry, but I’ve decided to join a profitable dungeon exploration party! I’m penniless after my panties were taken hostage.
Hey, wait a second. The female adventurers aside from Aqua and Megumin are starting to give me cold looks, so please don’t speak anymore.
This is acceptable as payback, right? Well then, I’ll be back after earning some cash, so have fun in the meantime, Darkness! I’ll find what quests are available!
Um. Aren’t you going with her, Darkness?
… No. Thieves are essential for dungeon exploration, so there are many teams that’d want to recruit Chris. On the other hand, vanguards like me can be found anywhere.
It’s already evening, are they going to explore the dungeons now?
The best time to go dungeon diving is early in the morning, so most people would set off one day earlier like them and make camp before the dungeon. There are even merchants operating with these adventurers as their target market. So how was it? Did you learn any skills?
Humph, why not see for yourself? Here I go, Steal!
… What happened? After your level and stats increased, did you change jobs from an Adventurer to a pervert? Um… It’s a little drafty, so please give me my panties back…
Strange? It shouldn’t be like this… It should be a skill that steals something at random!
I was right! To strip the panties of a young girl with so many people watching, you really are the worst…! Please…! Please let me join this party!
No.
Hmm…? Eh…!
Hey, who’s this person, Kazuma? Was she the one who came for the interview while Megumin and I were in the bath?
Hold on, this lady’s a Crusader. There’s no reason to reject her, right?
Darkness, we might look this way now, but we’re serious about taking down the Demon King.
That’s right, you listen too, Megumin. Aqua and I want to take down the Demon King no matter what. That’s our goal as adventurers. And so our adventures will only become more dangerous, especially for Darkness. As a female knight, you might experience ‘that’ if you get captured by the Demon King.
That’s right! Since ancient times, getting sexually harassed by the Demon King was the job of the female knights! That alone would be worth the trip!
Eh…!? What!?
Huh…? What is it? Did I say something weird?
Listen carefully too, Megumin. The opponent’s the Demon King. Aqua and I are planning to fight the strongest being in this world, so don’t force yourself by staying in this party…
I’m Megumin! The top mage of the Crimson Demons, the master of explosion magic! For the Demon King to overlook me and call himself the strongest, I’ll decimate him with my strongest spell!
… Hey Kazuma, Kazuma…
I was a bit scared when Kazuma put it that way. Is there a simpler way to take on the Demon King?
Emergency quest! Emergency quest! All adventurers in town, please gather at the adventurer’s guild! I repeat, emergency quest! Emergency quest! All adventurers in town, please gather at the adventurer’s guild!
Hey, what are ‘emergency quests’? Are monsters raiding the town?
… Um, it’s probably cabbage harvesting. It’s the season for them.
Huh? Cabbages? Is that the name of some monster?
A cabbage is something round, green and edible.
It’s crunchy and refreshing, a delicious vegetable.
I know that! Then what’s happening? The guild said there was an emergency quest. So do the farmers need help from the adventurers?
Ah, Kazuma probably doesn’t know. Let me tell you, the cabbages of this world…
I apologize for gathering everyone on such a short notice! I’m sure everyone knows that the emergency is because of the cabbages! It’s time to harvest cabbages! The quality’s great this year and each one’s worth 10,000 eris! We’ve already evacuated the residents so please harvest more cabbages and turn them in here! Please take care of your own safety and don’t get hurt from the cabbages’ counterattack! Also, because of the large amount of people and bounty, the reward will be given out later!
The cabbages in this world can fly. When their taste ripens during harvest season, they fly through cities, over plains, across the continent and to the ocean, unwilling to be eaten. Because of that, we need to catch the cabbages and eat them while they’re still delicious.
May I go back to the stables and sleep?
Why does a mere cabbage taste so good? I don’t get it.
You’re skilled, Darkness! As expected of a Crusader! The cabbages couldn’t break through your iron-wall defense no matter what they did.
No, I didn’t do much, I’m just really tough. I’m clumsy and slow so I can’t really hit my target; my only strong point is shielding others… Megumin has an impressive offence. You took out the horde of monsters that were chasing the cabbages right into town with just one explosion attack; all the other adventurers were shocked.
Kuku, no one could stand up to the power of my explosion magic… But Kazuma was the most active one, he picked me up after I exhausted my mana and carried me back.
… Yeah, when I was surrounded by cabbages and monsters, Kazuma showed up and captured all the cabbages attacking me. Thank you for rescuing me.
Indeed, erasing your presence with Lurk, grasping the movement of the cabbages with Enemy Detection and surprising them with Steal from behind. That was just like an outstanding assassin.
Kazuma, with my authority, I grant you the title of ‘Elegant Cabbage Thief’.
Shut up! I’ll slap you if you call me that! Ah! Enough, why’d things turn out this way!?
Well then. I’m Darkness, a Crusader. Theoretically, my weapon’s a two-handed sword, but don’t count on it too much. I’m clumsy with my hands and tend to miss. But I’m good at being a tank, so please take care of me.
…Humph, our party’s becoming great. I’m an Archpriest, Megumin’s an Archwizard, and now we have the defensive specialist vanguard, the Crusader Darkness. Three out of four members having top-tier jobs is rare, Kazuma! Do you know how lucky you are? You have to be grateful, okay?
Ugh… Ah, the feeling of being ravaged by cabbages and monsters is unbearable… I’m the only orthodox vanguard in this party, so don’t hold back. Use me as bait or as a shield. If it’s necessary, you can even cut me off as a sacrifice… Hmm! Just… Just imagining that made me tremble in excitement…!
Well then, Kazuma. I’ll probably… No. I’ll certainly be a bother to you, so don’t hold back and lecture me viciously. Please take care of me from now on.
… Why do I have to tag along and shop with you?
No, you should prepare some equipment too. I might only have my gym clothes, but you’re in the same boat, right? Your only equipment’s that flimsy hagoromo, right?
Don’t be stupid–I think you’ve forgotten that I’m a goddess! This hagoromo’s a holy relic. It can defend against abnormal statuses and has great durability. It’s a heavily enchanted precious artifact! There’s no other equipment better than this!
That’s great news. If we really can’t make ends meet, then we can just pawn off your holy relic… Oh. This chest armour looks neat, although it’s made of leather.
… Ka-Kazuma, you’re joking, right? This hagoromo’s proof of my divinity! Y-You won’t really sell it, right? No! I-I won’t allow it!
… Oh, I almost couldn’t recognize you.
Whoa–Kazuma finally looks the part of an adventurer.
It’s the giant toad mating season, and they’ve been showing up near town. How about…
No toads!
… Why not? Toads fear blades and are easy to take down, their sole mode of attack’s grabbing prey with their tongues, and the meat of toads can be sold for easy money. I’ve heard that you might get eaten if your equipment’s too weak, but since toads hate metal, Kazuma should be safe with his current equipment. I’ll protect Aqua and Megumin.
Eh… The two of them were eaten by toads before, so they’ve got some psychological trauma about it. They were eaten head first in one gulp and ended up covered in slime, so it can’t be helped. Let’s find another quest.
… Eaten head first in one gulp… Covered in slime…
… Did that make you excited?
No way.
The emergency cabbage hunt aside, this is our party’s first quest. Let’s pick something easy to complete.
What an introverted hikiNEET… Only Kazuma has the weakest job, so I understand why you’re being cautious. But including me, the other members have top-tier jobs! We should take on a bunch of high-difficulty jobs and make lots of money, level up like crazy and take down the Demon King easily! That’s why we should take on difficult quests!
… I really didn’t want to say this, but… You haven’t been of use so far.
!
Normally, you should be giving me powerful abilities or equipment, allowing for me to live here without worries. I know that this is a free service provided by the gods, so I didn’t want to complain. I was blinded by rage back then, but choosing you instead of an ability was my fault! But you’re here in place of those abilities or equipment, and are you performing on par with those special abilities or equipment? Are you? You were acting so great and confident in the beginning, but you’ve totally not been of use, you former something.
Ugh… No, not former. Um… In principle, I’m still a goddess…
Goddess!? What should a goddess be doing!? Guiding the hero to fight the Demon King and sealing the Demon King before the hero’s strong enough to take him on! And what’d you do during the cabbage hunt!? You did grab a lot toward the end, but you were spinning around because of them and threw a tantrum on the floor, right? Even vegetables can make you cry! Are you really a goddess!? Are you really qualified to call yourself a goddess!? Your only contribution’s getting eaten by a toad and party tricks!
Wah, wahhh–!
I-I’m useful, all right? Like healing spells and healing spells or healing spells! What, you’re just a hikiNEET! If you continue to play around, how long do you think it’ll take to defeat the Demon King? If you’ve got something to say, spit it out!
I’m a professional gamer who didn’t go to high school at all, you think I have nothing to say about this situation?
You’re a pro gamer?
… It sounds better this way, so listen up, Aqua. I don’t have the special power of the protagonists in stories, but I have the knowledge of Japan. So I want to sell Japanese products that can be created easily and aren’t available in this world. Think about it: my luck stat’s so high that even the counter lady suggested that I should become a merchant, right? So I think I shouldn’t force myself to take on the work of adventurers, but find another way. It’ll be easier to gain experience points if I have more money, right? There are ingredients that make you stronger just by being eaten, like those cabbages.
That’s how it is, so you think about it too! Think of a business that can earn cash easily and teach me your only good point which is healing magic! I want to learn healing spells after getting more skill points!
No–! I won’t teach you healing magic! No way–! Don’t snatch away the reason for my existence! You’ll be fine without learning it with me around! No, I don’t want to–!
… What are you two doing…? The attack power of Kazuma’s words are strong. If you don’t hold back and shoot your mouth off, most girls would cry!
If you accumulate too much stress… I could take Aqua’s place and endure your scolding, so lecture me all you want. Don’t hold back… As a Crusader, suffering for others is a merit.
Ignore this fellow for now, but…
… Darkness-san, you look thinner when you wear your armour…
… Hmm? Did you mean to say, ‘Are you trying to tempt men with your body, you sow!’, right?
No.
Hey, what’d you mean with that glance? I want to hear it.
It doesn’t mean anything, I’m just glad I’m not a lolicon.
Crimson Demons would gladly take on anyone wanting a fight. Good, let’s take this outside.
Back on topic, how about choosing a quest that can help Aqua level up?
What do you mean? Is there such a quest?
It’s normally hard for clerics to level up, they lack offensive spells after all. They won’t fight on the front lines like warriors or defeat enemies with powerful magic, so the best monsters for clerics to grind are the undead. Undead are a race that go against the nature of the gods, so the power of the gods will cause opposite reactions on them. Using healing magic will make their bodies break down.
Yes, that seems great. The problem is that Darkness’s armour isn’t ready…
I’m fine with it, my full set of defensive skills aren’t just for show. Even without armour, I dare say that I’m harder than an adamantoise. And it feels better without armour when I get hit.
… You just said it feels great to get hit.
… No I didn’t.
Yes you did.
I didn’t… The only question is whether Aqua’s willing…
Hey, how long are you going to cry? Participate in the conversation, we’re talking about your level…
… Snore…
Slow down, Kazuma, I saw that meat first! Here, the vegetable on this side’s done, so eat this instead!
After the cabbage hunt, I don’t like eating vegetables anymore. I’m afraid of the vegetable flying off somewhere if I grill it.
… Excuse me, please give me some water. I feel that Kazuma’s more proficient than me in using magic. No one uses basic spells, but you make it look convenient.
Is that so, isn’t this the way to use basic spells? Oh right, Create Earth! … Hey, what’s this spell used for?
Well, the crops grown from magically created earth are high in quality… That’s it.
What, Kazuma wants to plow the land? Are you changing jobs to a farmer? You could use Create Water for the plants too! This job’s a great fit for you, puhehe!
Wind Breath!
Puhe, ahhh! Ah–! My eyes!
… I got it, so that’s how you use this spell.
No, normal people don’t use it that way! And why are you using basic spells better than a mage!?
… It’s getting cold. Hey Kazuma, our quest’s to take down the zombie maker, right? I have a feeling it won’t be a small fry, but a big shot undead.
… Hey, don’t say such ominous things. What if you really jinx the quest? Our quest for the day’s to defeat one zombie maker and return the zombies to dust. We can then go back to the stables and sleep. We’ll also go back immediately if anything out of the ordinary happens. Understand?
What’s this, I feel a strong presence. It should be the effect of Enemy Detection. Enemies ahead. 1, 2 3, 4…?
… Hmm? I think… That isn’t a zombie maker…
Are we going in? Even if that isn’t a zombie maker, anyone staying in the cemetery at this hour’s probably an undead. If that’s the case, then it wouldn’t be a problem with Archpriest Aqua around.
Ah–!
Wait! Hey, wait up!
How dare you show up here, lich! I’ll take care of you!
Stop, stop–! Who are you? Where’d you come from and why are you destroying my magic circle? Stop! Please stop?
You’re noisy, shut up undead! You must be thinking of using this suspicious magic circle for devious means, I’ll stomp it! Stomp!
Stop–! Please stop–! This magic circle’s used to send the wandering spirits to heaven! Look! The spirits are floating from the magic circle toward the sky, right?
You’re acting too arrogant for a lich! An Archpriest like me will perform such benevolent acts, so just scram! You’re taking too much time, watch me purify the whole cemetery along with you!
Eh? Wait, stop!
Turn Undead–!
Hya–! My, my body’s fading! Stop, my body’s disappearing! I’ll be purified!
Ha, foolish lich! Your existence goes against the law of nature, an undead which defies the will of the gods! Disappear, be vanquished by my power!
Hey, stop it!
…! That hurts! Why’d you hit me!?
Hey, are you fine? Um… May I address you as ‘Lich’?
I-I-I’m fine… Thank, thank you for saving me from that crisis…! Um, you’re right, I’m a lich. My name’s Wiz.
Eh, Wiz? What are you doing in this cemetery? You said you wanted to send the spirits to heaven… Now, I don’t want to agree with Aqua, but that shouldn’t be what a lich like you should be doing, right?
What are you doing Kazuma!? Be careful or you’ll get contaminated and turn into an undead! Let me cast Turn Undead on her!
B-Because as you can see… I’m a lich, the overlord of the undying. As the overlord, I can hear the voices of the spirits wandering in the world. Most of the spirits in this public cemetery don’t have money and didn’t have a proper burial, so they couldn’t move on to the afterlife and haunted the cemetery every night. Since I’m an overlord, I’d visit periodically and send the children on their way.
I think that’s a wonderful thing, but… Although I’m not Aqua, wouldn’t it be better to leave this to the priest in this town?
B-Because… The priests in this town are materialistic… Eh, no. I mean… The rites for those without money would be pushed down their waiting list… Something like that…
You mean the priests in this town are people who worship money? The public cemetery which is full of poor people is basically ignored by them, right?
W-Well, that’s how it is…
Since that’s the case, then it can’t be helped. But could you stop animating the zombies? We’re here because of a quest to defeat the zombie maker.
Ah, I see. But I didn’t animate them, the corpses that are intact would rise automatically due to my magic every time I come. Um, I won’t have any reason to visit if the spirits in the cemetery don’t wander anymore and return to heaven… So, how should we resolve this?
I can’t accept this!
It couldn’t be helped; she was such a nice person. You couldn’t bear to kill her, right?
But for a lich to live normally in town, the security’s really lacking.
We were lucky things turned out so well in the end. Even with Aqua here, the opponent was still a lich. If we really had fought, Kazuma and I would definitely be dead.
Eh, are liches such dangerous monsters? Would it have been a tough fight?
It’s much worse than that! Liches have a high magic defense, so nothing can harm her except enchanted weapons. She can trigger all sorts of abnormal statuses just by touching her enemies, and she can also drain their life and mana; she’s a legendary immortal monster. What surprised me was that Aqua’s Turn Undead had such a great effect on such a powerful being.
Kazuma, give me the name card. I want to set up a holy barrier around the home of that woman and make her cry.
Please let her go.
By the way, what about the quest to defeat the zombie maker?
Ah.
Have you heard? Rumour says that a General of the Demon King’s army has taken over the old castle on that hill a short distance away from town.
A Demon King’s General. That sounds bad, but it has nothing to do with us.
That’s right.
Anyway, it’s better not to approach the abandoned castle to the north of town. This isn’t the capital of the kingdom, so who knows what a Demon King’s General is doing here. But since it’s a general, it’s probably an ogre lord, vampire, archdemon or dragon. No matter what it is, it’ll be a monster that can kill us instantly. It’d be best not to take any quests around that place for now.
… What? Why are you all looking at me like that?
Nothing– I wasn’t worried about Kazuma joining another party or anything.
…? Eh, I was just gathering information. That’s what adventurers do.
What are you doing, Kazuma?
… Hmm. You looked so happy. You were really having fun chatting, Kazuma. Were you that close with members of the other parties?
… What’s this refreshing feeling? Seeing Kazuma being on good terms with the other parties, the melancholic feeling’s mixed with something good. Could this be the legendary NTR…?
What’s with all of you? Isn’t collecting intelligence in such a place what adventurers do…?
… What’s with this dodging–!?
S-Stop–! What are you doing to my vegetable sticks!? No, don’t destroy the food!
How dare a mere vegetable look down on me! It’s a little late to say this, but… But how can the vegetables run!? Can you please serve food that is already dead!?
What are you talking about? Be it fish or vegetable, it tastes better if it’s fresh, right? Haven’t you heard of killing it and serving it on the spot?
Right… Forget it, let’s ignore the vegetables for now, I’ve got something important to ask you. I was thinking about what new skills to learn after leveling up. To be honest, the composition of this party’s too unbalanced. So I’m thinking of making up for our weakness since I have the most flexible job. By the way, what skills have all of you learned?
My skills are centred around Physical Defense, Magical Resistance and Abnormal Status Resistance. I also have a skill called Decoy that’s used to taunt the enemy.
… Don’t you plan to learn something like Two-handed Sword to increase your attack accuracy?
I don’t plan to. It might sound like I’m boasting, but my stamina and strength are great. If my attacks land easily, I could easily defeat monsters without taking damage. And it’s not good to hold back intentionally. This is how things should go: Attacking with all my might but not being able hit the enemy and being captured as my strength wanes. That’s the best.
Enough you, shut up.
… Hahaha…! You’re the one who asked, but to treat me like this…
Of course, I learned explosion-related skills… Explosion, Explosion Damage Increase, Fast Chanting, et cetera. All the skills needed to cast the perfect explosion spell. It’s the same as before and will be so in the future.
… Do you have no intention of learning something like mid-tier magic?
I don’t plan to.
As for me…
There’s no need.
Ahem?
Why can’t this party get its act together…? Maybe I should think about switching parties…
!
Kazuma, look! I earned a lot, so I upgraded the armour I sent in for repair. How does it look?
This armour looks like something the upstart son of nobility would wear.
… Kazuma’s merciless regardless of the situation. Even I want to hear an honest compliment from time to time.
There’s someone even worse, so I don’t have the time to play with you. Could you please take care of that pervert before she drops lower than you?
Huff…Huff… I can’t, I can’t take it! The magic of this manatite staff, the colour and glister…Huff…Huff…
What’d you say–? Wait, what’s this?
Hey…! How could this be…!
Why’s there only 50,000 eris!? Do you know how many cabbages I caught!? It’s more than 20!
Um, this is hard to say…
What!?
… What Aqua-san turned in was mostly lettuce.
… Why was lettuce mixed in there!?
Even if you ask me that, I wouldn’t know!
Ka~zuma-san! How much did you get from this quest?
A little over a million.
A million!?
Kazuma-sama–! How should I put this, I always thought you were such a great person!
Don’t push yourself if you can’t think of any ways to compliment me. Let me say this first: I’ve already decided on how to utilize the money, so I won’t give you any.
Kazuma-san–! I thought I’d earn a lot from the quest, so I spent all the money on me these past few days! I estimated I’d make a killing, so I owe nearly 100,000 eris in this bar! I can’t pay it off with the bounty!
I don’t care, you’re the one who wanted ‘everyone to keep their own earnings’. Anyway, I should find a house for myself. It’s uncomfortable to keep staying in the stables, right?
Why did it turn out like this? Ahhh! Please, Kazuma, lend me money! Just enough to pay off my debts! I know Kazuma’s a boy and you’d do sneaky things in the stables sometimes, so I understand why you want a private room! 50,000! Just 50,000’s enough! Please–!
I get it, 50,000’s just chump change! I really get it, so shut up!
Kazuma, let’s hurry and find a quest! One with lots of weak monsters! I want to test the power of my new staff!
You’re right, when we were hunting the zombie maker, I didn’t have time to test out my new skills. Let’s find a safe and simple quest.
No, let’s find a quest that can earn lots of money! I cleared my tabs, so I don’t even have money for food today!
No, let’s find one with strong enemies! One with monsters that have strong attacks and are tough as nails…!
Anyway, let’s decide after looking at the bulletin board.
… Weird? Why are there so few requests?
Kazuma! Pick this one, this one! A giant bear showed up in the mountains, its name is Black Fang…
Rejected! Hey, what’s this? Why are there only high-difficulty quests left!?
I’m sorry… A Demon King’s General seemed to have moved into a small castle near town… It might’ve been the influence of the general, but the weak monsters in the region have all lain low, resulting in a drastic drop in quests. A band of knights dispatched from the capital will be here next month to take out the general. But before that, there are only high-difficulty quests left…
Why–!?
Really… Why did he pick this moment to move here!? I don’t know what this general is, but it’d better watch out if it’s an undead!
That means that before the powerful adventurers and knights from the capital arrive here next month, we can’t work as usual.
That’s how it is… During this period when we can’t do quests, I’ll need you to accompany me…
Here should be far enough, right? Hurry up, cast your spell so we can head back.
No, the guards will lecture me again if we do this too close to town.
You said ‘again’ just now, right? Because it was too loud?
…? What is that, an abandoned castle?
It feels creepy… As if there are ghosts residing in there…
Let’s pick that place! No one will complain even if I destroy a ruin like that.
Explosion–!
Oh, that seemed pretty good. The impact of the explosion could be felt through my bones, followed by the air tremors which trailed immediately after. It’s strange that the abandoned castle remains intact but… What an explosion!
Great explosion! Kuku, Kazuma understands the way of explosions more now. Your comment today hit the mark and was poetic, so… How about it? I’m not just talking about this casually; Kazuma do you want to seriously consider learning Explosion magic?
Yeah– the path of explosions is interesting… But from the composition of our current party, there’s no need for two mages. But when I retire from adventuring and have leftover skill points, it would be interesting to use them to learn explosion magic.
Emergency broadcast! Emergency broadcast! Attention all adventurers, please prepare for combat and report to the main gate of the city!
… I’m a Demon King’s General, and have recently moved into a castle nearby…
Every day, every day, every day! Where is that crazy idiot who comes to my castle to cast Explosion every day–!?
… Explosion?
The one who knows explosion magic is…
If you’re talking about Explosion, it would be…
Huh? M-Me? Why are you all looking at me? I can’t use explosion magic!
So, it’s you…! Are you the moron who cast Explosion on my castle every day? If you knew I was a general of the Demon Army and wanted to challenge me to a fight, then enter the castle! If not, then just hide in town and tremble! Why are you bothering me with such evil means? I knew there were only low-level adventurers in town! I wanted to leave such minor characters alone, but you can’t catch a clue and come boom, boom, boom with your spells every day…! Is there something wrong with your head?
I’m Megumin. As an Archwizard, I have mastered explosion spells…!
… What kind of name is Megumin, are you mocking me?
No, that’s not it!
I am a Crimson Demon, and the elite mage of this town. I cast explosion magic continuously to lure you, the Demon King’s General, out…! As I planned, you came to town alone after being tricked; your end is near!
… Hey, this girl actually said that. She was playing around, saying she would die if she didn’t cast explosion magic every day, so I brought her to the area around that castle. When did it turn into her plan?
… Yeah, and she used the chaos to declare herself as an elite mage of this town.
Shhh–! Don’t say that out loud! She hasn’t used her explosion spell yet and a bunch of adventurers are backing her from behind, so she’s adopting a strong position. She’s still talking, so let’s see how this goes!
… Oh, a Crimson Demon. I see, so that weird name wasn’t a lie.
Hey, if you have any comments about the name my parents gave me, spit it out!
… Hmph, forget it. I didn’t come here to mess with peasants like you. I’m here to investigate something. I’ll be staying in that castle for the time being, so don’t cast Explosion on it anymore. Understand?
That’s like asking me to die. Those of the Crimson Demon clan need to cast explosion spells once every day, or we’ll die.
Hey, I’ve never heard of this before! Stop bullshitting me!
You don’t plan on giving up explosion magic no matter what? Even though I have taken the side of darkness, I was a knight before and have no interest in slaughtering the weak. But if you continue to bother me with such things, I have my way of handling things too.
We’re the ones being bothered, alright!? Because of you staying in that castle, we couldn’t even do our work properly! Hmph… You can only act high and mighty now. We have an expert that deals with the undead here! Master, I leave it to you!
I guess it can’t be helped–! I don’t know if you’re a Demon King’s General or what, but you’re unlucky to come here when I’m around. An undead coming out in broad daylight when your powers are at their weakest; you’re just asking to be purified! It’s all your fault that I couldn’t take on any quests! Okay, are you ready to face the music?
Oh, impressive. You’re not a normal priestess… but an Archpriest, right? But no matter what, I’m still a Demon King’s General. I have not fallen so low that I would be purified by a low-level Archpriest in a place like this. I have my ways of dealing with Archpriests too… But I’ll start by torturing this Crimson Demon girl!
I shall predict your death! You will die one week from now!
Huh? D-Darkness!
Darkness, are you all right? Does it hurt anywhere?
… Yeah, I didn’t feel anything.
That curse won’t harm you now. My plans were foiled a bit, but since the camaraderie among adventurers is so deep, this must hurt more… Listen carefully, Crimson Demon girl… If this goes on, that Crusader will die in a week. Hmph, your important companion will be tortured by the horror of death in the meantime… That’s right, this is all your fault! In the following week, you will see the pain of your companion and regret your actions! Hmm… Hahaha, you should’ve obediently listened to me!
There… There is such a thing!? That means you have cast a death curse on me, and I must do as you say for you to release said curse! That’s what you meant, right!?
Huh?
Ugh…! Just a mere curse, don’t think you can make me submit…! I won’t yield…! But, what should I do Kazuma!? Look at that Dullahan, look at his evil lustful eyes under his helmet! No matter how I see it, he wants to bring me back to his castle and do as he pleases if I want him to release the curse. A pervert that wants me to do hardcore perverted play!
… Huh?
Even if you can do what you want with my body, you will never have my heart! I’m going to become a female knight imprisoned in a castle and let the henchman of the Demon King do unreasonable things with me! Ah, what should I do…? What should I do, Kazuma!? This situation is more thrilling than I expected! I don’t want to go, but I have no choice! I’ll resist to the very last moment, so don’t stop me! Well then, I’ll be back in a jiffy!
Huh…? Huh?
Stop right there, you can’t go! Look how troubled the Dullahan is!
A-Anyway! If you have learned your lesson, stop casting Explosion on my castle! And the Crimson Demon girl! If you want me to release the curse on that Crusader, then come to my castle! If you can make it to my room at the very top, I’ll release her curse! But… My minions are everywhere in the castle, and it is full of undead knights. Can you rookie adventurers make your way to me? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Hahaha!
Hey, where are you going? What do you plan to do?
I’m responsible for this incident. I’ll head to the castle and cast Explosion on that Dullahan directly to dispel Darkness’s curse.
I’ll go with you. If you ran into some minions and used your spell, that would end right there. I didn’t realize that was the castle of the Demon King’s General either, even though I was with you all this time.
… Well then, let’s go together. But he said that there would be a bunch of undead knights there. If that’s the case, then weapons will be useless. My magic will be more practical… So, you have to rely on me when the time comes.
I can use my Detect Enemy skill to search for monsters in the castle and conceal myself with Lurk and sneak in. Or we can visit the castle every day and defeat the enemy on each level, one day at a time, before coming back. We’ll reduce enemy numbers slowly… And since the time limit is one week, this plan should work.
Hey Darkness! We’ll break your curse! So, don’t worry…
Sacred Break Spell!
With me around, breaking the curse of the Dullahan is easy! What do you think? I look like a priestess sometimes, right?
… Huh?
I want to take a quest! It’s fine even if it’s a bit hard, let’s take a quest!
Huh…
I’m fine with it… But I alone won’t have enough combat power and Megumin…
Please, I beg you–! I don’t want to work anymore! The store owner gets mad if I don’t sell all the croquettes! I’ll work hard! I’ll do my best this time–!
All right then… Then look and see if there are any quests that look fine. We’ll go with you if the quest isn’t too bad.
… Kazuma, shouldn’t you look too? If you leave it to Aqua, she’ll probably pick an incredible quest…
… You’re correct, but I won’t mind even if the quest is a bit hard…
… Good.
Good your head! What quest are you taking!?
You idiot!
What we need is to let Megumin hit them with an explosion while they’re together to settle it in one shot. Why are you so timid…?
This one! Look at this one!
… You can purify the lake?
Idiot, who do you think I am? From my name and appearance, you should be able to tell what kind of goddess I am, right?
Aren’t you the goddess of banquets?
As if, you hikiNEET! I’m the Goddess of water, all right! Didn’t you see my beautiful blue eyes and hair?
Let’s take this one. Or rather, wouldn’t you alone suffice if it’s just purifying the water? You can hog all the rewards this way, right?
Well…  the monsters will harass me while I’m purifying the water, right? Before I finish the purification, I hope you all can protect me from the monsters.
By the way, how long would the purification take? Five minutes or so?
… About half a day?
That’s too long!
Ahhh! Please, I beg of you–! There’s no other quest that’s as good! Please help me, Kazuma-san–!
… Hey, how does the purification process work?
… Hmm? To purify the water, I just need to touch it with my hand and continuously cast purification magic…
Hey Aqua, I think there’s a way to purify the water safely. Do you want to give it a try?
… Hey… Are we really going to do it this way?
… I feel like a captured rare monster that’s going to be sold…
… I feel like a tea bag being drained of its flavour…
Hey–Aqua! How is the purification going? Is it cold staying in the lake? Give a holler if you want to go to the restroom! I’ll let you out of the cage–!
Purification is proceeding smoothly! And I don’t need to go to the restroom! Archpriests don’t go to the restroom!
There seem to be no problems. By the way, Crimson Demons don’t need to use the restroom either.
As a Crusader, I also don’t… Need to go… Ugh…
Darkness, don’t compete with these two. And as for you two, I’ll accept a quest that can’t be completed in a day to confirm if they really don’t need to use the restroom.
Don’t… Don’t do that, okay? Crimson Demons really doesn’t use the restroom! But I apologize, so don’t do that… By the way, the brutal alligators aren’t showing up. It would be great if things end peacefully like this.
Ka-Kazuma–! Something’s coming over! No, lots of things are coming here!
Purification! Purification, Purification–!
Purification! Purification–! The cage is creaking! It’s creaking! The cage, cage is making weird sounds!
Aqua–! Tell us if you want to give up–! We’ll drag you along with the cage with the chain–!
I-I don’t want to! Giving up now means I won’t be able to get paid for my time! Purification! Purification–! … Wahahaha–! There was a cracking sound! The cage made a sound it shouldn’t be making!
… Staying in that cage seems rather good…
… Don’t even think about it.
… Hey Aqua, are you all right? The brutal alligators have left for some other place.
…Sniff… Ugh…Hic…
Good girl, the purification is done… Let’s go back. I’ve discussed with Darkness and Megumin, and we won’t take the reward this time. The 300,000 is all yours.
… Hey, it’s time to come out of the cage, all the brutal alligators are gone.
… like this…
What did she say?
… She said the world outside the cage is scary, so bring her back to town as she is. 
Do Na Do Na Do–Na–Do–Na–…
Eh… Hey Aqua, we’re already back in town, so can you stop singing that song? We’re gathering a lot of attention just by dragging a battered cage with a woman hugging her knees inside. And it’s safe back in town, so it’s about time you come out.
Don’t want to. This is my holy realm. The world outside is scary, so I don’t think I’ll be coming out for a while. 
G-Goddess-sama! Isn’t this goddess-sama? What are you doing in such a place?
… Hey, don’t act familiar with my companion. Who are you? If she knew you, why is Aqua not reacting at all?
… Hey, it’s someone you know, right? He called you goddess-sama just now. Go and handle that man.
… Ah! Goddess! That’s right, I’m a goddess. And? What problems do you want this goddess to settle? You guys are really helpless!
… Who are you?
Why are you saying this goddess-sama! It’s me Mitsurugi Kyouya! I received the magic sword, Gram, from you!
…?
Ah! Yes, there was such a person! Sorry, I totally forgot about you. I sent a lot of people here, so it can’t be helped if I forgot!
Eh, it’s been a while, Aqua-sama. As your chosen hero, I’ve been working hard every day. My job is Sword Master. I’m already at level 37… Oh right, what is Aqua-sama doing here? Or rather, why were you locked in a cage?
… Preposterous, this is too illogical! What were you thinking, bringing goddess-sama to this world? And you locked her in a cage and threw her in the lake for this quest?
You, what are you doing? This is nothing. I’m living every day happily, and am not angry about being brought to this world! And I can go back after defeating the Demon King! Today’s quest was a bit scary, but it was resolved smoothly. No one was hurt and the reward is 300,000. 300,000! And everyone said they would let me take all of it!
… Aqua-sama… I don’t how this man talked you into this, but you’re being treated too illogically. After such a sacrifice, you only earned 300,000…? You are a goddess! For a goddess to be treated this way… By the way, where do you stay at night?
With everybody, in the stables…
Huh?
Hey, watch yourself. You’ve been unreasonable all this while. This must be the first time you’ve met Kazuma, so there should be a limit to how rude you can be.
… Crusader and an Archwizard? And… They look rather good too. Seems that you had great luck in finding companions, but that doesn’t make sense. Don’t you feel ashamed in letting Aqua and these two excellent members sleep in the stables? You mentioned your job was the weakest Adventurer, right?
Hey, isn’t staying in the stables the norm for adventurers in this world? Why is this guy so mad?
Well, I think he was granted a powerful sword when he was transported to this world, and completed a bunch of high-difficulty quests from the beginning. He probably had no worries about money… But that’s the usual case for people with special abilities or equipment.
It must have been hard on you all so far. Please join me from now on. Of course, I won’t let you all sleep in the stables, and will buy the full set of premium equipment for you. The balance of the team is great. Me as a Swordmaster, my Warrior comrade and you as a Crusader: along with my Thief comrade, this Archwizard and Aqua-sama. What a perfect combination, it’s a match made in heaven.
It feels wrong. The self righteous way in which he talks made me cringe.  And his narcissistic tendencies frighten me.
What should we do? I feel physically repulsed by this man for some reason. I prefer active people over passive ones, but somehow that guy makes me want to beat him up.
Can I cast my magic? Can I throw an explosion spell into the face of that elite who’s talking down to us without ever experiencing a day of hardship?
Hey Kazuma, let’s hurry to the guild, okay? I might’ve been the one who gave him the powerful sword, but I think it would be better not to get too close with such people.
Well– My companions don’t seem keen to join your party. We still need to report the completion of the quest, so we’ll take our leave…
… please move out of the way.
Pardon me, but Aqua-sama is the one who bestowed this sword to me. And seeing my benefactor who granted me power fall to such a state, I can’t simply ignore it. You can’t save the world, the one to defeat the Demon King will be me. It would be better for Aqua-sama to follow me… You said you chose Aqua as the item to be brought along to this world with you, right?
… Yes.
If that’s the case, then how about making a bet? You chose Aqua-sama as the ‘thing’ to be brought along with you, right? If I win, you must give Aqua-sama to me; If you win, I can promise you one thing, anything.
Okay, I accept! Take this!
Eh? Wait! Hold…!
Steal–!
Huh?
Scumbag! Scumbag! Scumbag! Scumbag–!
How dirty! You’re the worst, scumbag! Can’t you fight honorably?
No matter what, I won. This guy said he would promise me anything if he lost, right? Then I’ll be taking this sword.
What!? What absurd thing are you saying!? Only Kyouya can use that magic sword. That sword chooses its owner, and it chose Kyouya as its master! The blessing of the sword won’t work on you!
… Is that true? I can’t use the spoils of war? I was thinking that I had finally gotten a strong piece of equipment.
It’s true. Regrettably, the sword Gram is the exclusive weapon of that unpleasant guy. It bestows one with arm strength beyond the human limits when equipped, and the sword is a sharp weapon that can cut through steel like a vegetable. But in Kazuma’s hands, this would just be a normal sword.
I’ll be on my way then. Tell that guy when he wakes up that he was the one who wanted the duel, so no complaints… All right, let’s go to the guild for the bounty, Aqua.
Y-You, hold it right there!
Give Kyouya’s sword back! We won’t acknowledge your win!
It’s fine if you want to bring it on… But I’m a believer in gender equality, a man who dares to use drop kicks against girls. Don’t think I’ll hold back against you two! I should say that since you are girls, I might humiliate you in public with Steal.
Ugwahh…
W-Why–!?
Didn’t I tell you, the cage I borrowed from you wasn’t damaged by me! It was that Mitsurugi guy who bent the bars! Why do I have to pay for it!?
… The bounty this time, after deducting the compensation for the broken cage, was only 100,000 eris… The staff said that the cage was made from a special process and material, so it cost 200,000…
Next time I meet that man, I’ll definitely give him a God Blow! And get him to cough up the compensation for the cage!
So that’s where you are! I had a hard time finding you, Satou Kazuma!
Satou Kazuma! I asked a female thief about you and she told me everything immediately. She said you like to strip woman of their panties. Other than that, your interest is to cover girls in slime. Lots of people are talking about you, devilish Kazuma.
Hold on, who’s the one spreading this? Tell me properly.
… Aqua-sama. I swear to you, after I get my sword back from that man, I will defeat the Demon King. So please join me and form a party- Puah…!
Ah! Kyouya!
Compensate me for the cage you destroyed! It’s all your fault that I had to pay for that cage! Because that cage was made through a special process and material, it cost me 300,000, okay! 300,000! You hear me, pay up!
… Even though I was defeated in that way, it was still my loss. Although it is shameless and selfish of me to say this after promising to do anything you wish… I beg of you! May you return the sword to me? That sword wouldn’t be of much use to you, it’s just sharper than normal swords if you wield it. That’s the most you can get out of the sword… How about this? If you want a sword, I can buy the best one in any shop and give it to you… May you please return it to me?
Using me as a prize without my permission, and asking for your sword back by offering to buy a good one in exchange… There’s no way this deal would work! Or do you think my worth is equal to the most expensive sword in a shop? Insolent fool! I’m a goddess! A goddess! To use me as a betting chip, what the hell are you thinking? I don’t want to ever see your face again, shoo. Hurry up, scram!
Please! Please wait, Aqua-sama! I’m not looking down on your value…
…? What is it little girl…? Hmm?
… Just a heads up, the sword is no longer with this man.
!
S-Satou Kazuma! Where is the sword? You, where did you take my sword to?
I sold it.
Damn you–!
… What’s with that guy… Speaking of which, he had been addressing Aqua as a goddess all this while, what’s up with that?
I’ve never told you this before, but very well… I’m Aqua, the patron goddess of the Axis Cult, goddess of water… That’s right, I’m that Goddess Aqua…!
… So, that’s the backstory you’re going by?
That’s wrong! And why did both of you say the same thing!?
Emergency broadcast! Emergency broadcast! Attention all adventurers, please prepare all your equipment and gather at the town’s main gate ready for battle–!
Again…? There are so many of these ‘emergency summons’ recently.
Emergency broadcast! Emergency broadcast! Attention all adventurers, please prepare all your equipment and gather at the town’s main gate ready for battle–! Especially Satou Kazuma-san and his companions, please head to the scene as soon as possible!
… Huh?
Oh, just as I suspected. This guy’s here again.
Why didn’t you come to the castle, you inhuman–!
Well… You invited us to the castle, but that doesn’t mean we must go. And what do you mean by ‘inhuman’? We stopped casting explosion magic, so why are you angry?
Stopped casting explosion?! You say it stopped?! Stop lying to me! That crazy Crimson Demon girl is still visiting every day!
Huh?
… Did you do this? I told you not to, but you still went?
Ow! Ow! Ow! It hurts! Stop! No, listen to me, Kazuma! I was satisfied with casting explosion on an empty plain not so long ago… But after I knew the charm of attacking a castle with magic, my body changed and I could only accept big and hard things…!
Don’t fidget around while saying that! And you can’t move after casting your spell, so that means you have an accomplice! Who in the world…
It’s you, right–!?
Wahahaha–! That dullahan was the reason we can’t get any good quests, so I wanted to vent some of my frustration! I was lectured by the store owner every day because of him!
I’m not furious because of the explosion magic! Don’t you all have the will to save your comrade? I might be this way now, but before I was executed because of unjust reasons and morphed into a monster, I was an honourable knight. Where I stand, that Crusader who was cursed while protecting her companions was the classic model of a knight, but you abandoned her…!
… Err, hey…
… What, what’s up with this–!?
It’s been a week since Darkness was cursed but she’s still alive. He must be really shocked, right, right? That Dullahan must have thought that we would head to the castle to break the curse and was waiting for us in vain, huh? He didn’t even know I broke the curse in no time after he left, right? Puhehe! This is hilarious! Super~ funny!
… Hey, you there! If I get serious, I could kill every single person in this town! Don’t think I’ll keep letting you off! As an undead, I won’t ever tire! You bunch of rookies won’t be able to even scratch me!
I’m the one who has no reason to let you off! I won’t let you escape this time! How arrogant for a mere undead to act in this manner! Disappear, Turn Undead!
You think a Demon King’s General wouldn’t be prepared to fight priests? Too bad. Including me, all the undead knights in this band have received the protection of the Demon King. We have a very high resistance against holy spells- Ahhhhhh–!
Hey, hey Kazuma! This is strange, it’s not working!
Hmph… Wait for me to finish! I am Beldia, a Demon King’s General, Dullahan Beldia! With this armour that was enchanted by the Demon King and my own powers, Turn Undead from a normal priest won’t work on me!… It shouldn’t work at all…
… Never mind. Because our diviner was raging on about a strong light descending near this town, I came here to investigate… In the beginning, I thought it was too much of a hassle and considered destroying the entire town…
Hmph, you’re not worthy enough for me to do it in person… Go, my brothers! Let them know what hell tastes like!
Ah! That guy was scared because Aqua’s spell was unexpectedly effective! He’s planning to use his minions to attack us while he escapes by himself!
T-That, that’s not it! This was my plan from the very beginning! A Demon King’s General is not a weakling who escapes on his own! You wouldn’t fight the boss at the very start. Of course, you would need to defeat the underlings first, that’s the tradition since ancient times-
Sacred Turn Undead–!
Yahhh–!
W-What should we do, Kazuma!? This is strange! My spell isn’t working at all.
Damn, damn you…! Let someone who’s talking finish! Enough! Hey, my brethren…!
All the people in this town… Kill them all!
Wahhh–! Priests! Get the priests here–!
Someone go to the Eris church for holy water, get all that you can–!
Hmph, hahaha! Come, let me hear your screams… Of… Despair…?
Wah, wahhh–! Why just me? I-I’m a goddess! A goddess, so I always do good deeds!
Ahhh! How, how sly! I’m the one who always does good deeds, so why are all the undead knights running over to Aqua…!
You, what are you all doing!? Don’t just chase that priestess, cover this town with the blood of the residents…!
Hey Megumin, could you cast an explosion spell on that bunch of undead knights?
Eh!? This is inside the town and they’re too dispersed, I might miss some of them…!
Wahhh, Kazuma-san–! Kazuma-san–!
You fool! Hey, don’t come this way! Lure them somewhere else and I’ll treat you to dinner tonight!
I’ll pay for dinner, just help me get rid of these undead! They’re weird! I couldn’t purify them with Turn Undead!
Megumin, wait outside the town and standby with your spell–!
Huh? Got… Got it!
Kazuma-san! How does it look behind me!? I think we got all the undead knights in town to follow us–!
Megumin, do it now–!
What a wonderful situation! I’m grateful, thank you Kazuma…! I’m Megumin! The elite mage of the Crimson Demons, wielder of explosion magic! Demon King’s General, Beldia! Behold my power! Explosion–!
Hmm… Everyone’s lost for words after witnessing the power of my explosion… Fuahh… Including the one narrating this speech, all this… Feels so good…
… Want me to give you a piggyback?
Ah, thank you. I can’t move because I’m too pleased with the spell. Can you help me put my eyepatch back?
My mouth is full of sand…
Woah! That’s awesome, girl with a screw loose!
The Crimson Demon girl with a screw loose took all of them out!
So aside from your weird name and loose screw, you’re great when it’s time to perform. I’m impressed!
Sorry, I want to cast an explosion on those people. Please bring me over there.
You’ve used all your mana. You did great today, be confident and have a good rest… Thank you for your hard work.
Crimson Demons have high intelligence.
… Want me to guess what Kazuma is thinking?
… I’m thinking that Megumin’s breasts are bigger than they look.
Fuhahaha! Interesting! That’s interesting! To think my minions would be wiped out in a novice town like this! All right, I’ll keep my promise!
I’ll personally handle you all!
… Oh–? The targets I prioritized should be those two over there… But… Hmph, if you all somehow manage to defeat me, you will get a hefty bounty… Come, novice adventurers dreaming of getting rich instantly. Charge at me at once!
Hey, no matter how strong he is, he doesn’t have eyes on his back! Surround him and attack!
Hey, the opponent is a Demon King’s General. How can such a simple tactic take him down!?
Just buy us more time! After hearing the emergency broadcast, the ace of this town will rush over! If that guy’s here, the Demon King’s General will be done for! Hey brothers, let’s go together! Aim for his blind spot! All at the same time!
Wait, stay back…
Huh?
Who’s next?
Trash, trash like you…! Trash like you will be done in with just a slash from Mitsurugi!
That’s right, just hold on a bit longer! When that magic sword guy comes, he’ll definitely take on the Demon King’s General…
You’re Beldia, right? Let me tell you, there’s a powerful and high-level guy in this town!
… Oh? So, you’re my next opponent?
Don’t worry Kazuma. In terms of toughness, I won’t lose to anyone. And I can use my skills on my weapon and armour too. Beldia’s sword might be powerful, but do you really think it can cut through steel armour like paper? From how the adventurers were killed, Beldia probably possesses powerful attack skills. I want to find out how my defense does against them!
Don’t do it! Beldia not only hits hard, he’s great at dodging too! All the adventurers attacking at the same time couldn’t hit him, so there’s no way you could with how clumsy you are.
… As a Crusader… As someone with the job of a guardian, there is something that I will not back off from. Let me protect you two.
Oh! You’re taking the initiative? As a Dullahan, it’s only expected that I should come to blows with a Crusader. All right, bring it on!
… Huh?
Seems like I expected too much. Enough… Well then…
All right, next is… Huh?
Ahhh! I just got my armour from the shop!
You, what is it with you…? Why aren’t you hurt after being hit by me…? Is that armour made by a famous artisan? No… It’s not possible even with that… That Archpriest and that Archwizard that loves explosions too, who the hell are you people…?!
Darkness! You can withstand that guy’s attack! Leave the attacking to me, I’ll support you!
I leave it to you! But please create a chance for me to hit him once, all right?!
Mages–!
All of you will in one weeks’ time–! Will die in the streets–!
All right, I’ll attack seriously this time!
Ka-Kazuma! Darkness, she’s…!
Oh, how straightforward! Okay, how about this?
Hey, Darkness you’re hurt! Enough, come back! All the adventurers will scatter and come up with a new plan!
Crusaders will never retreat when protecting someone! I won’t ever compromise on that! Also!
Also! This Dullahan is very skilled! He has been chipping my armour off slowly bit by bit…! He didn’t strip me naked directly, but left pieces of armour behind, making it more sexual than being naked. He wants to humiliate me in public…!
Huh?!
Look at the time and place, you unrepentant pervert!
Ugh…! Ka-Kazuma, you should be the one watching the time and place! I’m at my limits as I’m being ravaged by the Dullahan in public, and Kazuma is humiliating me too…! What are you trying to do to me, ganging up on me with the Dullahan like that!?
Huh?!… Huh?!
No one wants to do anything to you, pervert! Create Water!
… To use this skill so suddenly… You… You’re good, Kazuma. I don’t really dislike this. Although I’m fine with it, you should watch the time and place…
Wrong, this isn’t some weird sexual play! This is what I wanted to do! Freeze!
!? Oh, freezing the ground around my feet to stop me from moving…! I see, you thought my strength would lay in dodging? But…!
Stopping you from dodging will be enough! I’ll take your weapon from you! Take this, Steal–!
… That wasn’t a bad idea. Unfortunately, I’m a Demon King’s General. Such is the difference between our levels. If our powers were a bit closer, it might’ve gotten dangerous for me.
Don’t harm my comrade!
Thieves, hear me out–! The chances are low, but we’ll win if we snatch his sword! Everyone who can use Steal, come and help!
Steal–!
Ahhh!
… Ugh…!
Darkness! Kazuma, Darkness is in danger!
I had fun, Crusader! For me who was originally a knight to cross swords with you, I’m grateful to the Demon King and god of evil! All right, watch this…!
Create Water–!
!
… Kazuma, um… I’m fighting seriously here…
It’s water–!
Create Water! Create Water! Create Water–!
Hmph! Woah? That was close!
Hey, why are you guys messing around? Why are you playing with water with the Demon King’s General? I’m working seriously, so how can you start having fun, Kazuma? Are you an idiot?
It’s water, water! This fellow’s weakness is water! And you’re a goddess of water, right!? Or are you just a phony goddess? Can’t you even summon water?
!? Don’t be rude, careful of my divine retribution! What is all this talk about being a phony? I’m a true goddess! Water?! You want to talk about water with me?! Your weak stream is nothing, I can even summon a flood! Apologize! For accusing me of being a phony goddess, apologize!
I’m fine with apologizing however much you want, just summon it if you can, you useless goddess!
Wah ahhh–! You dare say I’m a useless goddess!? Watch this, I’ll show you just how great I can be when I get serious!
You small fries, your water is ineffective against…?
The familiars in this world…
The goddess of water–Aqua–commands you…
Sacred Create Water!
Hey…! Wait…!
Hya–! Water, watahhh–!
Puah…! Wait, I’m drowning…!
Megumin, Megumin–! Hold on tight, don’t get swept away!
Hey… Hey…! What were you thinking… Are you an idiot?! You must be a moron…!
Do it now, my stellar performance has weakened that guy. Use this chance to defeat him, Kazuma! Hurry up! Hey, hurry up you!
I’ll definitely snatch your weapon this time! Take this–!
Just try it! Even if I’ve been weakened drastically, it’s impossible for a mere novice to take my weapon!
Steal–!
Ahhh…
Ex-Excuse me…
Ex-Excuse me… Can you return my head back to me…?
Hey everyone, let’s play soccer! Soccer is–! A game that forbids the use of hands, where you only use your feet to control the ball–!
Huh? Ahhh–! Wait, hey, don’t do that!
Yahahaha! This game is fun!
Hey here! Pass it to me too–!
Stop! Please, it hurts, stop!
Hey Darkness, want to hit him with your sword?
This blow is for the people who took care of me but were killed by you! I don’t want to hit too many times, so take all of their share with this one hit!
Wahhh!
Great. Aqua, the rest is in your hands.
Leave it to me!
Sacred Turn Undead–!
Wait, hold on…! Hyaaa–!
… Darkness, what are you doing?
… I’m praying. The Dullahan was a knight who was executed unjustly, and turned into a monster because of his grudge. It might be weird to say this after smashing him with my sword, but there’s no reason not to pray for him…
I see…
… Cedre’s arm strength was weaker than mine, so he spread an idiotic rumour that my body was full of muscle… Heinz once said to me, ‘Hey, it’s hot today, fan me with that large sword of yours, all right? It’s fine if you hit me, that is if you can!’ as he laughed like a moron while teasing me… And Garilhe, I joined his party once and made him yell, asking why I kept charging into the middle of the monster hoard… They were all killed by that Dullahan. Thinking back, they might not have been great guys, but I didn’t really dislike them…
Um… I see. I’ll listen to the rest later, let’s go back to the guild for now.
… If I could meet them again… Just once is enough, I would want to have a drink with them…
O-Okay…
How should I put this… It’s my bad. I didn’t know you thought of us that way…
That’s… That’s right, I’m sorry for spreading that weird rumour because I lost to you in arm wrestling… I-I’ll treat you to a meal next time…
Actually… Were you really conscious about not being able to hit your enemy? I-I’m sorry about that…
Darkness, leave such things to me! At my level, fresh corpses that haven’t passed on too long ago can be resurrected by me easily! This is wonderful, now all of you can drink together again!
Isn’t this great? Meeting everyone once again… Let’s go and drink with everyone.
… I want to die…
Don’t you prefer when others humiliate you with words? Don’t hold back, I’ll keep bringing this up for the next three days.
This… This is not the kind of humiliation I want…!
Ah! You’re too slow, Kazuma! Everyone’s already starting to get smashed!
Hey, hurry and collect the bounty, Kazuma! Almost all the adventurers have claimed their rewards for defeating the Demon King’s boss! I did too! But as you can see, I drank a lot of it away!
You’re here, Kazuma. Quick, collect your reward.
I waited really long for you, Kazuma. Listen to me, Darkness is really petty, saying it was too early for me to drink…
Wait, it has nothing to do with being petty. That’s not what I meant…!
Eh, well… Satou Kazuma-san, correct? We have been expecting you.
Well… First will be the rewards for these two ladies.
… Actually… It’s like this. The guild has decided to present a special reward for Kazuma’s party.
Huh, why just us?
Hey, MVP! If not for you guys, there’s no way we could have beaten that Dullahan!
Ahem–To honor Satou Kazuma and his party’s victory over the Demon King’s General, Beldia… The guild awards them 300 million eris.
Three…
Hey, 300 million, it’s your treat Kazuma–!
Woah–! Kazuma-sama, treat us! Treat us–!
Hey Darkness, Megumin! I have something to tell both of you! I plan to cut down on adventuring in the future! With such a large amount of money, we could live a peaceful life of luxury!
Hey, wait a minute! It’s troubling if I can’t fight strong enemies! And what about defeating the Demon King?
This is a problem for me too! I want to defeat the Demon King with Kazuma and gain the title of the strongest mage!
Eh, things are like this. Because of Kazuma’s party… Which is to say, Aqua-san’s flood, the buildings around the town were washed away and damaged like a catastrophic disaster… But taking into consideration the merit of defeating a boss of the Demon King, the town won’t ask for full compensation, just a part of it… That’s how it is…
Reward is 300 million… The compensation is 340 million… Kazuma, let’s take on quests with strong enemies to earn lots of money starting tomorrow.
Right, Ojou-chan, I’ll leave it in your hands.
Heh, leave it to me. Feast your eyes, for I shall demonstrate a glimpse of my true power right here! Were I serious, this entire quarry…! Ah, could you stand a little bit further back? Yeah, there’ll do.
Why do I have to accompany you?
I don’t have a choice. I won’t be able to move after using my magic, so I’ll need you to carry me home.
I don’t need to be here for that. You could just let the civil engineer uncle carry you back. He’s probably stronger than I am.
What kind of nonsense are you saying? Take a look at this heavyset, beastlike man. If I was left alone with this man, unable to move, who knows what he would do to a frail girl like me?
That won’t happen!
Hey! Why are you two screaming like that!? Why don’t you explain it to me in detail!?
W-Well, leaving that aside, our objective is that giant boulder. We can’t get to work with that in the way. I discussed this issue with the guild, and they recommended you to me. So, what do you think? Are you up to it?
Of course! My name is Megumin! The one who will eventually slay the Demon King! A rock like that is but a pittance compared to…
Pii~! Pii~!
Oh, that’s a wyvern! A wyvern hatchling! My god, to think that something like this could be nesting so close to town… But it’s good that you are here, Ojou-chan. Blow it away along with that rock. It may be a hatchling, but wyverns are highly aggressive carnivores. If we let it be, it’ll cause widespread damage in the future. Its parents aren’t here, so it’s a great chance to get rid of it.
Ah!
U..uuu…
Hah, well, I guess it can’t be helped! It’s probably too cruel a job for an Ojou-chan. I’ll call you back to destroy that boulder after the wyvern has left the nest!
Let’s take it down in a proper battle once it’s grown up.
Still, you missed out on a great chance there, Ojou-chan. It may be young, but you’d still become a Wyvern Slayer after killing it. And wyverns are also a type of dragon. You’ll be able to call yourself a Dragon Slayer after that.
You can call yourself a Dragon Slayer even if you defeat a hatchling? That’s nice, isn’t it? It definitely sounds like the title of a hero who will defeat the Demon King-
Explosion-!
My name is Megumin! Wielder of explosion magic, and the one who defeated a dragon! Kazuma, please call me ‘Dragon Slayer Megumin’ from now on.
You little piece of… Can’t you just let things end happily for once!?
Satou Kazuma-san… Welcome to the afterworld. I’m Eris, the goddess who’ll guide your way. Your time in the mortal world is up.
… I want money!
Anyone would want that. It’s the same for me too… By the way, aren’t you being too useless? To let a goddess like me stay in the stables, don’t you know any shame? If you get it, let me live more luxuriously. Take better care of me!
… Do you know why I crave for money so badly?
The elegant and wonderful me couldn’t possibly understand what a former hikikomori like you is thinking about. You’re after the funds you need to stay a hikikomori forever, isn’t that it?
It’s debt.
It’s the debt, all right! Because of the money you owe, the reward from that quest was completely gone! My brows were frozen when I woke up in the stables this morning! The other adventurers are already renting rooms in the tavern to sleep! If we keep sleeping in the stables this winter, we’ll freeze to death! Get a grip, now is not the time to say stupid things like, ‘I’ll return victoriously after defeating the Demon King’!
That couldn’t be helped! If not for my superb performance, this town would’ve been destroyed! How unreasonable to just throw the debt at us without a word of thanks! This is ridiculous! I want to complain to the counter staff!
Hey, stop that, don’t trouble the counter lady…! In the end, we did receive a large reward… It was just negated by the debts. Destroying a part of town wasn’t something that could be ignored.
What’s with you!? Kazuma was just running away before I weakened him enough for you to use Steal on him! Praise me more! Respect me! Don’t stop worshiping me! Everyone in the guild should adore me as a goddess and respect me!
You annoying egotistic idiot! You’ll act all arrogant if I don’t put you in your place! Fine, I admit the incident was settled all thanks to you! So, you’ll get all the credit for it, are you happy now!? Then go clear the debts alone!
Wahhh, wait! Sorry, I was wrong, I apologize… Don’t abandon me!
Really, making a scene so early in the morning. Everyone’s watching… They aren’t watching. The guys in the guild have gotten used to you two…
You two are up early. Did you find any good quests?
Yo, are you two ready, too? We haven’t found any jobs, and I don’t think we need to rush. It’s fine to wait for you two to join us before we hunt for quests.
Let me see… The bounties are great for these quests, but there are no decent ones left…
… Mobile Fortress Destroyer is approaching, recruiting scouts for reconnaissance regarding its route of advancement…? What? What’s this Destroyer?
The Destroyer is the Destroyer. The huge and fast mobile fortress.
It rampages around and is strangely popular among the kids.
Hey, what’s this ‘Snow Sprite Hunt’? That doesn’t sound very strong.
Snow Sprites are weak monsters. They can be found in places with lots of snow, and will shatter when hit with a sword. But…
Hunting Snow Sprites? Snow Sprites aren’t dangerous monsters, but defeating one will allow spring to arrive half a day earlier. If we’re taking this quest, I’ll need to prepare.
Snow Sprites…
… Hey, can’t you do something about your attire?
I want to catch the Snow Sprites and put them into these bottles! If I put one together with a beverage in a box, I’d be able to drink ice-cold Neroid at any time! It’ll be like a fridge! What do you think? I’m smart, right?
Where’s your armour?
Still being repaired.
… The armour was battered after the fight with the Demon King’s General … But is this equipment okay…? Well, I don’t think the Snow Sprites will attack us, though.
It’s fine, don’t worry. It’s a bit cold, but this is like a cold endurance contest. It feels nice…
Megumin, Darkness! They’re escaping your way, take care of them! Damn, they’re squirming all over!
They float around leisurely if you leave them alone, but they dodge agilely if you attack them.
I caught a fourth one! Look, Kazuma! What a harvest!
They’re too fast, Kazuma. Darkness and I can’t get them… Can I use Explosion to blow up an area?
All right, I’m counting on you, Megumin. Get them all.
Explosion!!!
Eight! I took out 8. And I raised a level!
… Ah, it appeared!
… Kazuma. Let me tell you why the adventurers don’t take on quests in the winter.
You stayed in Japan in the past. When you were young you must’ve heard this name during this season in the weather reports and news, right?
The master of the Snow Sprites, and the symbol of winter itself…
That’s right. This is the Winter Shogun.
This is stupid! All the people, food, and monsters in this damn world are stupid!!
Ugh!?
Ahhh!? My sword is…!?
Winter Shogun; one of the special monsters with a high national bounty. The Winter Shogun is the Fairy of Winter… Fairies don’t have a material body. It manifests itself according to the unconscious descriptions and images of the people it meets. The Fairy of Fire would turn into a violent salamander according to ‘the desire to engulf everything in flames’. The Fairy of Water reminds people of the young, beautiful and sensible goddess of water, so they would manifest themselves as a young girl… But the Fairy of Winter is a bit special, all right? In the winter with dangerous monsters all around, even adventurers won’t leave their homes, so few people have met the Fairy of Winter… That’s right, except for the bunch of cheaters who were transported here from Japan.
… You mean this thing is here because those idiots from Japan thought ‘When you think  about winter, you have to think about the Winter Shogun’? Why did they think such troublesome things? What should we do? Can we fight the fairy of Winter!?
Kazuma, listen to me! The Winter Shogun is a merciful being! If you apologize properly, it’ll let us go!
Prostrate! Prostrate yourself, quick! Everyone throw your weapons away! Apologize! Hurry up Kazuma, apologize!
Hey, what are you doing, hurry up and kneel!
Ugh…! Even I have my pride as a Crusader! Even if no one is watching, as a knight, I can’t lower my head to a monster because of fear…!
You’re always happily chasing monsters around, so why are you displaying your boring sense of pride now!
Stop! Ugh, I don’t want to lower my head, but because you so crudely forced me down, my face is touching the ground, what a reward! Hahaha… Ah, the snow is cold…!
Kazuma, the weapon! Throw the weapon in your hand away now!!
Um… Have you calmed down?
Ah… Sorry, I lost my composure. That was embarrassing of me.
This is nothing to be ashamed about. You lost your precious life after all…
Um, may I ask? Do you know what happened to the monster that killed me?
It’s fine, the Winter Shogun disappeared after cutting you down.
Satou Kazuma-san. You came from peaceful Japan and encountered something like this… Brave soul who came from another world, I will use my power to let you reincarnate in peaceful Japan to a wealthy family and live a free life.
Hurry and come back Kazuma! How can you be killed off so easily in such a place! It’s too early for you to die!
Wait, what’s happening!?
Wha–! This voice, Aqua-senpai!? I was thinking that Archpriest looked just like Senpai; could it really be her!?
Kazuma, can you hear me? I have cast Resurrection on your body, you can come back now. There’s a goddess before you, right? Ask that girl to open the gate back here.
Okay, wait for me, Aqua! I’ll be right there!
Hold on, wait a minute! No, no, I’m sorry, you’ve already been revived once. By the laws of the heavens, you can’t be resurrected again! The other side can’t hear us, unless Aqua-senpai is connected to your voice. Could you help me pass along the message?
Hey, Aqua, can you hear me!? She said that I’ve already been revived once, so I can’t be revived again because of some rules in heaven!
Ah? Which goddess said such foolish things! Tell me your name! A goddess watching over such a far-off place should respect an elite like me who oversees Japan!!
Eh, it’s a goddess-sama by the name of Eris…
Eris!? That flat-chested Eris that audaciously used her name as the currency unit, just because she was worshipped as the national religion of this world!? Listen, Kazuma, if Eris continues to prattle, you just go for the pads in her bra and–
I get it, I get it! I’ll make an exception this time! I’ll open the gate now!
Really, Aqua-senpai is still as unreasonable as ever.
This way, the gate to the mortal world… Really, this wouldn’t normally happen. By the rules, be it kings or big shots, everyone else only gets one chance… Really. You’re Kazuma-san, right?
Eh, ah, yes!
Please keep this a secret, okay?
… zuma…! Kazuma, get up! Kazuma!
… Ah, you finally got up? That child is so stubborn, really.
Hey Kazuma, don’t get hung up on being embarrassed. There should be something you want to say to us, right?
I want a swap.
How dare you hikiNEET! If you want to see that child so much, I’ll send you there right now!
Stop, stop! Don’t rough up someone who was just revived, you violent goddess!
… Is your body okay? Does it feel weird anywhere?
It seems fine. By the way, how was I killed?
You were beheaded by the Winter Shogun. It was a clean cut. Thanks to that, it easily reconnected and the healed. I restored a bit of your blood, but not completely. You’ll feel weak if you do anything strenuous, so, you’re banned from vanguard duties. It’ll be over if you get hurt and bleed again, understand?
Beheaded…!
But getting 12 in an hour. 1,200,000… It was a decent haul, but not worth dying for. That Winter Shogun is said to be a special monster. How much is his bounty? To break Darkness’s sword in one blow, he seemed stronger than Beldia who was worth 300 million.
The Winter Shogun is a monster that doesn’t do anything if you leave the Snow Sprites alone. Even so, the bounty should be about 200 million. As a Demon King’s General, Beldia, had a high bounty because of how dangerous he was. For the Winter Shogun who doesn’t actively attack humans to have a bounty of 200 million… it shows just how strong the Winter Shogun is.
… Megumin, could you use Explosion on that?
The Winter Shogun can’t be defeated by Explosion. Although it had a shape of a human, it is still a fairy. Fairies are immaterial, an existence just like mana. If it was an existence like the Fairy King, its magical defense would be rather high. Although Explosion could deal damage to all sort of existences, it would still be hard to settle it in one blow… Also, I don’t want to cast Explosion on such a scary opponent.
Hmph, Kazuma, you look rather down. But I wasn’t just thinking about prostrating. Here, look!
Oh! That’s smart of you, Aqua. Okay, hand this over, I’ll crush it right now.
Wha–! No, this child is for my fridge!! To drink ice-cold Neroid in summer… No, don’t kill this child! I even gave it a name, so you can’t kill it! No, no!!
Hehe, I have to take good care of this child and make lots of ice in the summer. And I’ll sell shaved ice with this child on the roadside! I’ll sleep with it in the hot summer night…! … Hey, Megumin, do you know what this child eats?
I don’t know what Snow Sprites feed on. Really, what do they eat?
It looks light and fluffy, probably tastes good if you dip it in sugar and put it in your mouth…
?
… Sigh.
Ah!!
Hey, say that again.
I can say it as many times as you want. You mentioned a luggage-carrying quest? In a party full of high-tier job members, can’t you take on a harder quest? You’re the dead weight holding them back, right, man with the weakest job?
Hey, say something, weakest job holder. Really, bringing three pretty ladies around, are you planning to create a harem? And all of them have top-tier jobs. You must be creating wonderful memories everyday with these onee-sans, right?
Kazuma, don’t bother with them. I won’t mind no matter what they say about me.
That’s right Kazuma, ignore those drunkards.
Yeah, that man is just jealous that Kazuma has us. I don’t mind, so just leave them be.
Being surrounded by top-tier classes is so blissful. How envious it is to not know suffering! How about switching places with me, bro?
I’ll gladly switch!!
… Huh?
I said that I would switch with you! Hey, you think I’m a pushover because I didn’t say anything, right! Ahhh, that’s right, I have the weakest job! I’m fine with that… But you! What did you say after that, you jerk!?
Ka… Kazuma?
After that part? Um, bringing three pretty ladies and creating a harem…
Pretty ladies!? Harem!? You said harem!? Hey, are those things in your eye sockets made from glass!? Where are the pretty ladies!? My eyes are bad and can’t see any pretty ladies, all right! Why don’t you change your glass eyes with my lousy ones!!
Ah, huh!?
Hey, you! Tell me! Pretty ladies? Where, where are they! You said you envy me, right? Ahh? You said that, right!?
Well… About that…
And after that? Being surrounded by top-tier classes is so blissful? How envious it is to not know suffering!!!?
… Um, well, sorry… The alcohol got to my head… But! The grass might look greener on the other side, but your situation is better! You said you want to change with me, right? Just one day. How about just switching with me for one adventure? Hey, you guys are fine with that, right!?
I-I’m fine with that… The quest today is just hunting goblins.
I’m okay with it too. But Dust, don’t say you don’t want to rejoin the party because it’s too comfortable there, all right?
I have no problems, either. Even with a rookie, the goblins are no big deal. As compensation, I hope you bring some great stories back.
Hey, Kazuma. Um, you guys seemed to be chatting happily, but aren’t you going to ask for our opinion?
No. Hello, my name is Kazuma. It might just be one day, but please take care of me!
Ah, okay…
I’m Taylor. I’m proficient with a one-handed sword, and I am a Crusader. I’m sort of like the leader of this party. It is just temporary, but you’re still part of our team. Please listen to my instructions, all right?
Of course. Or rather, I was always the one issuing the orders. Following your instructions should be a refreshing experience. Please look after me.
What? That party of top-tier jobs is led by an adventurer?
That’s correct.
I’m Lynn. As you can see, I’m a mage. I can use Intermediate Magic. Anyway, nice to meet you. And don’t worry, I’ll protect you, rookie! Goblins are a piece of cake!
I’m Keith. Archer. I’m confident with sniping. Anyway, pleased to meet you.
I’ll be in everyone’s care. I’m Kazuma. My job is adventurer… Eh, should I talk about things I’m good at?
No, no need. By the way, weren’t you looking for a quest carrying luggage? Kazuma, just help us with our bags. A simple quest of hunting goblins will be fine with just the three of us. Don’t worry, the bounty will be split equally 4 ways.
Hmm~ repel the goblins? Why did those things appear around the town? Can’t we take a quest with a higher reward? We need to let Kazuma know just how valuable we are.
No, I know you all are very capable, but I can’t match up with you all. Archpriest, Archwizard and Crusader. With such a formation, any adversaries would not be a match. But please pick a simple one this time… By the way, I see that you don’t have a weapon or armour, are you planning to go just like that?
No problem. I’m confident of my toughness, and my weapon wouldn’t hit anyway.
Wouldn’t hit…? No, that…? Never mind, it would work…
I didn’t plan to work during winter, but we managed to obtain this simple goblin hunting job. In summary, we’ll be hunting the goblins at the foot of the mountain path. If we set off now, we can make it back by night. Well then, rookie, let’s get going.
Anyway, why are the goblins staying at such a place? Not that I’m complaining. Thanks to that, we got this great quest of hunting goblins!
The goblins were spotted at the top of this mountain path, just as it starts leading down the slope. There might be goblins living in the caves beside the path, so be on guard from this point onwards.
Something’s coming from the mountain path ahead. My Enemy Detection skill picked it up. But it’s just one.
… Kazuma, you have the skill to detect enemies? And it’s just one? That shouldn’t be a goblin. There shouldn’t be strong enemies that can move alone here… This is just a straight path, we’ll be discovered even if we hide among the trees there. Should we fight?
No, I have the Lurk skill, so we won’t be discovered even if we hide. This skill is effective on party members that are touched by the user, so let’s hide in the trees first.
… Wah! How, how scary! Rookie Killer! That was a Rookie Killer!
My heart, my heart almost stopped! We’re saved…! I get it, the goblins moved to the mountain path so close to town because they were herded by the Rookie Killer.
Ah, that’s it… But this is troubling. It moved in the direction of our home. We can’t escape back to town that way.
Um, was that thing really that scary?
That’s a Rookie Killer. It hangs around creatures like goblins and kobolds, weaker monsters that are easy for rookie adventurers to handle, and preys on those adventurers in turn. This means the goblins are bait to lure adventurers. And to keep the goblins from settling at one place, it’ll herd the goblins to change its hunting grounds. A cunning and dangerous monster.
How scary.
Anyway, why don’t we complete the goblin quest? The Rookie Killer would usually protect the goblins that are used to lure the adventurers. If we kill the goblins and hide their bodies in the woods along the mountain path, it might ignore us like it did just now, and follow the scent of the bloody goblins instead. Even if it got close, we could rely on Kazuma’s Enemy Detection. We can’t just keep hiding here since we don’t know whether the Rookie Killer will come back. Let’s head for our destination.
If we encounter the Rookie Killer and needed to run, it would be better if Kazuma has a lighter load. I’ll take some too. As compensation, I’ll be counting on your Enemy Detection and Lurk skills, all right?
We… We aren’t relying on Kazuma, okay?
Kazuma, how is it? Any reaction from Enemy Detection?
There are a lot hiding around that corner. There is no sign of the Rookie Killer from the way we came from.
If there are many, then that must be goblins. The goblins live in groups.
I’ve never fought goblins before, but are there really supposed to be this many? How many are there in a normal group? I’m sensing way too many for me to count.
Hey, are there really that many of them? Since Kazuma said so, why not peek at how many there are, and go in when…
No problem, no problem! How could we let Kazuma hog the spotlight! All right, let’s go!
Woah! So many!!
Didn’t I tell you!? I already told you! Didn’t I say we should peek and see how many there were!!
There would normally be only a dozen or so goblins! Damn, if we run back, we might get caught between them and the Rookie Killer! There’s nothing to this, let’s do it!
Chi, chi, chi! Chi-, chi-!
Ouch! Shit, I’m hit by an arrow! Hey! There’s a goblin archer! Lynn, cast wind-defense spells, quick!
Lynn is still chanting, she won’t make it! Everyone, try to dodge!
Wind Breath!
Ka-Kazuma! Good job!
Wind Curtain!
With this terrain, this will work! Create Water!
Kazuma!? What are you…
Freeze!
Ohh!!
Taylor! We’ll handle the goblins trying to get back up! Leave the goblins staying at the back to the ranged attacks from behind!
W-Well done Kazuma! Hey, let’s go everyone! The numbers are no longer a problem, let’s finish the goblins!
Hahaha, isn’t this easy! Watch me shoot holes through them!
I’m going! I’ll cast my powerful magic into their midst!
… Hahaha, I’ve never heard of anyone using magic in such a way! Is basic magic really that effective?!
Really! I was taught at the magic academy that Basic Magic was just a waste of skill points! Haha, hahaha, what’s with that!
Wahaha, oh my, this is the first time I enjoyed hunting goblins this much! Ara, I thought we were doomed when I saw that large tribe of goblins!
Hey, the battle’s over, hand your bags over. Shouldn’t those with the weakest job, adventurers, carry the luggage?
Ah, sorry, we were mean to you and I apologize! I won’t look down on you again just because you’re an adventurer!
Sorry, Kazuma! Anyway, why is the one with the weakest adventurer job the most active! This is too strange!
Hey, Kazuma, give me the luggage! You’re the MVP today, so I’ll help you carry them!
Ugh… That hurts…
Hey, are you alright? I can learn recovery magic on the spot, but there are no antiseptics here, so it’s better to not seal the wounds before going back to town. Do clean the wound in town.
Kazuma, you can learn recovery magic…?
Recovery magic… Our team finally has someone who can use recovery magic…
Hey, stop it. Kazuma has somewhere to return to. He has a team that’s full of top-tier job holders… Really. Now I understand why Kazuma is the leader in a party of top-tier job members.
Hmm? Is there something charging at us?
Rookie Killer!
Ha… Ha…! Damn it, we have to face that in the end!
Hah, hah… Oh no, it’s catching up!
Lynn! We’ll get caught if this goes on! Escape to town with Kazuma! I’ll stall it, and Keith will support me! Get help once you reach town!
Oh!? Th-Th-That’s right! Le-Le-Leave it to me! Kazuma belongs to another party after all, but he performed the best! It’s our time to shine!
I-I understand! Let’s hurry, Kazuma!
Hey, wait Kazuma!? Aren’t you running!?
Create Earth!
Hey Kazuma! It’s dangerous, run!
Warghh! Bring it on, fur ball!
Wind Breath!
Wait!? Huh!?
Hey, now’s our chance! Run!!
Did, did we lose it?
Hah… Hah… I, I think we did?
… Huff… Huff… Fuhehehe…
Ha… Ha, hahaha…!
Aha… Ahahaha… Ahahaha!
Hey, what was that, man?! Kazuma, what did you do!? Wahahaha!
It’s Basic Magic, Basic Magic! It took me a lot of points, but as an adventurer, I could learn Basic Magic! Wahahaha!
How could there be such an adventurer! Ughahaha! My belly, it hurts from laughing! Alive, we encountered the Rookie Killer and lived!
Unconventional! This man is unconventional, in all sorts of ways! How high is his ‘intelligence’!? Hey, Kazuma, let me see your adventurer card!
Ah… Hmm? Intelligence is normal. The other stats too… Oh, what the!? This person’s luck is very high!!
Wah, what is this!
Oh, hey, was the quest proceeding smoothly because of Kazuma’s luck? Both of you, pray quick! You might receive some blessing!
Please, please don’t do that, don’t pray to me… How about getting some coffee instead? I can create clean water and fire too.
We’re here! That felt like a big adventure today!
Boo… Boohoo… Hoo, boohoo… Ah, Kazumaaaaa…
I genuinely understand how you feel, but please don’t close the door!
… Eh, what happened? No, I pretty much get it, so I don’t really want to hear it.
Listen to me! Listen!! It’s my bad, all right? You know, I asked everyone what skills they had when we left town. So, this kid told me she could use Explosion and I praised her for her abilities. And she said, ‘Let me show you my power’, and suddenly used all her mana on an empty grass plain to cast her explosion spell…
Hey, listen to me! After that, we encountered the Rookie Killer! Maybe it heard the explosion and rushed over. And the important mage was down at this critical juncture. I already said we should flee, but that Crusader charged at it despite not having armour, and the result was…
Hey everyone, this guy will probably report the incident with the Rookie Killer to the guild, let’s eat something and rest. Cheers to the formation of the new party!
Yeah!!
Wait! I apologize! I can kneel before you or anything, but please let me return to my original party!
Work hard in your new party from now on.
I was wrong, all right!! I’ll apologize for this morning, so please forgive me!!
Let’s go to a dungeon tomorrow.
Don’t wanna.
You have to.
Don’t wanna don’t wanna, I’ll lose my reason for existence if I go to a dungeon! If Explosion magic that might cause the dungeon to collapse can’t be used, I’ll become a normal person!
You haven’t forgotten what you said when you joined the party, have you?! Wasn’t it something like, ‘I’m willing to carry the luggage or anything when exploring dungeons! Please, don’t throw me away!’
Sigh… I understand, but I’ll really be useless, all right? I can only do things like carrying the bags…
Don’t worry, you just need to follow us until the entrance of the dungeon. If we meet any dangerous monsters on the way to the dungeon, I’ll be relying on you to repel them with magic, all right?
Hmm? Just the entrance? Will that really be fine?
By the way, why did you suddenly want to go to a dungeon? If you want to explore dungeons, the party needs a thief, all right? How about Chris? I haven’t seen her around the guild lately.
Chris said she was really busy. She said the senpai who took care of her in the past was pushing all sorts of troublesome matters to her. Seems like it’ll be some time before she comes back. But she taught me Detect Traps and Disarm Traps which are necessary for dungeon exploration. Chris said the type of monsters in dungeons won’t change because of the seasons. That’s why I thought of going into one and giving it a try.
Um, please wait a while more. My great sword broke during the fight with Winter Shogun. I have ordered a new sword, but it’ll take some time to finish. I can’t be considered a combatant right now.
You were never a combatant, so that’s not a problem.
!?
I’ll properly explain things so that there are no misunderstandings. The one infiltrating the dungeon will just be me, I hope everyone can be my escort on the way there.
?
All right, I’ll go alone from here on. The three of you just wait at this refuge for me. If I’m not back within a day, go back to town and ask for help from Taylor’s group… That said, I’m just scouting the place out, so I should be back soon.
Are you really going solo? It’s preposterous to challenge a dungeon by yourself. I heard what you said Kazuma, but I think with my armor clanking loudly just by walking, it would be useless for me to follow…
Me too, I would just be a burden if I follow… Think it over, Kazuma.
No problem, I’ll go with you!
… No, don’t follow me. I said I’ll be moving alone.
With the archer skill Farsight that Keith taught to me, I can see things in the dark. I’ve already tried this before. Even if there’s no light source and total darkness, I can still gauge the distance, where items are placed and their shapes. So, if I go alone, I don’t even need any light. The monsters that target adventurers with a light source won’t be able to find me.
By the way, I also have the thieving skills Enemy Detection and Lurk. So, I can walk in the darkness, confirm the layout, detect enemies and avoid them. Lurk allows me to tide over danger when I can’t avoid them just by sticking close to the wall… Probably.
I’ll be going then. It’s cold here and you might encounter monsters, so go back to the refuge and wait.
… Didn’t you hear what I said? It’s more convenient for me to move alone. It’s dark in there, so you can’t do anything even if you follow.
Hey, Kazuma, have you forgotten who I am? Archpriest is just my mortal disguise. Come on, say it–although Megumin and Darkness still don’t believe me–come, tell me what my job is!
Goddess of poverty?
No, I’m the goddess of water! You could’ve at least said I’m the goddess of banquets!
I’m a goddess after all; my eyes have the power to see through everything. Before Kazuma was reincarnated, I accurately told you the cause of your death, right? My powers have weakened after coming to the mortal world, but I still have a couple of godly powers, you know? I can’t see through everything right now, but there’s no problem in seeing through the dark!
The monsters in dungeons are usually undead. Those fellows would be attracted to the life force of the living. This means the Lurk skill is useless against undead monsters. This problem can only be solved if I come along, right?
Hey, Kazuma, is your night vision fine? My divine eyes can see the ugly posture of Kazuma walking timidly down the stairs. Tell me if your night vision isn’t working well, okay?
I can see clearly; your useless posture that hesitates every time you take a step down is shown plainly before me. Treat this as my request, please don’t fall down.
Really, my field of vision is so clear that I can run away if there’s any danger. Do tell me if any monster approaches us. I’ll watch our backs, so don’t touch my butt, all right?
Don’t worry, I don’t care about your butt. Let me tell you what I’m thinking–I’m seriously considering the ways to abandon you in the deepest parts of the dungeon.
How mean~ Kazuma keeps making jokes like this! Hehehe!
Silly Aqua. I was serious just now. We’ve been together for so long, so you should know when I’m serious~ hahaha!
… What is this?
Wahhh!!
… This corpse is about to become an undead monster. Kazuma, wait for a moment.
But, puhehe! This is too stupid, pushing himself to challenge a dungeon alone–Puhah! Hahaha!
What, what? Why are you making weird gestures suddenly? Want me to perform hand shadows? Then give me a light. Foxes and bunnies are out of fashion, let me show you the shadow of the Mobile Fortress Destroyer.
No! And what’s this Destroyer?! I’m just signaling to you that the enemy is coming, so we should run this way! Damn it, they spotted us! Hey, help me fight them!
… Hmm, I don’t know what this is. I can see the shape, but not the color, so I can’t tell. Hey, do you know what this is?
This is a low-tier demon called a Gremlin. The magic in dungeons are more powerful than the surface, so weak demons like this appear sometimes.
Hey, let me ask you, can you really see clearly in the dark?
My vision now is no different than in broad daylight. What is it?
So, when we were sleeping in the stables together, you saw everything?
I didn’t see anything. Because when I heard fap, fap, fap, your back was facing me.
… Thank you for your mercy Aqua-sama.
Lost souls wandering the cold dungeons, rest in peace. Turn Undead!
Thanks, Aqua, you’ve been a great help. It would’ve been dangerous if I had come alone.
Hmm? You’re finally seeing me in a new light…? Anyway, where are the treasures? This dungeon has been explored so many times, so I’m not expecting much either.
… Tch, there’s nothing good here.
Hey, Kazuma, the way you were exploring and that line you said made me feel like we are tomb robbers.
…? Hey, Kazuma, there seems to be something there.
Hey, that’s a treasure chest! That’s great Kazuma, we were right to explore the dungeon!
Hey, wait, wait. Don’t you think it’s weird for a treasure chest to appear in the dungeon where tons of people have explored…? Hmm, as I suspected, Enemy Detection is responding.
Ah… So it’s a Dungeon Mimic. It’s unfortunate, but it can’t be helped…
H-How disgusting! What is that!?
As the name of the monster implies, it cannot move, but part of its body can mimic the form of a treasure chest or money, luring the prey to take the bait. It’ll sometimes take the form of a human, and hunt the monsters that prey on men.
Turn Undead!
… Hey, isn’t this weird? There are too many undead here. A party without an Archpriest wouldn’t be able to subjugate the dungeon, right? And we haven’t found any treasure yet. Let’s forget it and go back.
You’re right. We didn’t find any treasure, but I’m satisfied after purifying so many undead… Hold on a minute, the scent of the undead is still lingering here.
Is there a priest amongst you?
Good morning, this is the first time we met. Though, I don’t know what time it is, so should I say ‘Good evening’ instead?
I’m Keele, creator of this dungeon. I kidnapped the daughter of a noble. That’s right, I’m an evil mage.
After making this wish, I kidnapped that lady,
…Which means you’re not an evil mage, but a good one? To get on the good side of the king, the daughter was offered to the king as a concubine. But she wasn’t loved, and didn’t have a good relationship with the queen and the other concubine. And you said something like, ‘Since you don’t want her, give her to me’, right?
That’s the gist of it. Afterwards, I proposed to the lady I kidnapped, she accepted me. Then I eloped with her while fending off the army of the kingdom… Ahh, that was fun. Oh, by the way, the one on the bed is her. How does she look? Isn’t the curve of her collar bone is beautiful?
And so, I have a request for that lady over there,
Request?
Could you send me to the other world? This lady should have the power to do so.
Did I make her happy?
Ah, that’s a big help. A lich can’t do something as ridiculous as committing suicide after all. I was quietly waiting for myself to decay when I felt a powerful holy aura, so I woke from my long slumber.
Archwizard Keele, you have forsaken the laws of the gods and became a lich by your own conviction. In the name of the goddess of water Aqua, I absolve you of your sin… When you wake up, you will find yourself before a goddess with unnaturally large breasts named Eris. If you don’t mind the age difference between you and the one you love, or if your relations aren’t between a man and a woman, and if you wish to meet her no matter what form it may be in… You can try asking Eris. She will make your wish come true.
Sacred Turn Undead!
… Let’s go back.
Hey, will that undead meet the lady again?
… Who knows. Eris will probably do something about it.
Anyway, that lich was a nice guy. He said money is useless to him and gave us all of his fortune. I don’t know how much it’s worth, let’s split it equally when we get back to town.
… That’s right. We have to use this money properly for his sake too.
Hey, Aqua, that guy said something earlier.
… What?
… That person. He said he woke up after sensing a powerful holy aura. Could it be that the reason we encountered so many undead monsters in this dungeon was because of you?
!?
I-I-I think… It shouldn’t be… Probably?
… When the Dullahan attacked, his undead knights seemed to be very attracted to you..
!?
Hey, Kazuma, you can’t stay too far away from me, all right? Don’t you think we should be closer to guard against monster attacks? Al-Also, with Kazuma’s half-baked night vision, you won’t be able to see the exit I marked with my chalk!
Hehehe, that’s how it is! There’s no way you can leave me behind here! In this situation, we’re ants on the same rope… Actually, no, without me who can tell the path back and fight off undead, Kazuma won’t be able to return by himself! The situation is in my favor! If Kazuma understands the situation, address me as Aqua-sama from now on, and spread word of my elegant performance in the dungeon to the people in town…!
Hey, wait Kazuma! Wait!? Don’t abandon me! Sorry, I’m sorry, it’s all my fault! I’ll apologize, so let me hide too! Please Kazuma! I beg you, Kazuma-sama!!
… I can probably guess what happened, but allow me to ask anyway. What the hell happened?
Wahhh! Kazuma, he! Kazuma, he wahhh!
Don’t blame me, this is because you attracted all the undead! You didn’t even reflect on it when we were returning! I’m taking back the high evaluation I gave you earlier!
But but–that’s just the way I am, I can’t help it! What do you expect!? Drop my holy aura to the same level as a hikiNEET like Kazuma!? If that really happens, all Axis devotees over the world would cry…!
You’re not reflecting at all! Go visit the dungeon and find the treasures that the lich and lady gave us, and learn something from those two! Let them teach you how to live properly!
Damn hikiNEET, how dare you ask a goddess to learn from a lich!
… The lich and the lady?
From what Aqua said, that lady had no regrets and properly passed on. What was the hard life on the run to her? That lich was still wondering if he blessed the lady with happiness. But from the way I see it, she was undoubtedly blessed.
… Of course she was happy, it’s obvious that she was blessed. I dare say her life on the run was one of the happiest times of her life.
All right, we’re here. Listen Aqua, let me be clear, don’t make a mess or act violently. And don’t use any magic, understand?
Hey, why are you restricting me from this and that? I’ve been meaning to ask you, but do you think I’m a delinquent or a bandit or something? I am a goddess, you know? A holy being.
Welcome… Ahhh!?
Ahhh!? You finally showed up, damn undead! You dare set up shop here!? A goddess like me must sleep in the stables, but you can open a shop? You’re getting too full of yourself, lich! I’ll burn your store down in the name of the gods!
Yo, Wiz, long time no see. I came to visit.
…Hey, doesn’t this shop know how to serve tea?
Ah, sorry!! I’ll bring it now!
Don’t serve her tea! I’ve never heard of a magic item shop that serves tea to its customers!
Ah, that’ll explode on strong impact, so please be careful.
Ah? Seriously!?
Ah, that one will explode if you open the cap, so…
What about this one?
It’ll explode when it touches water.
… How about that one?
It explodes when heated…
Does your shop only sell explosives?!
No no no! All the explosive bottle series just happen to be on that rack!
Wiz, you mentioned this before, right? You said you can teach me some of the skills of a lich. I have some skill points now, so could you teach me something?
Puu!
Hyaaa!
Hey, what are you thinking, Kazuma!? The skills of a lich? You say you want to learn a lich’s skills!? I was wondering what you said to her after taking this woman’s name card! The skills of a lich are all evil! It would be bad if you learned such skills! Listen, liches are basically the relatives of slugs that like dark and wet places.
How, how mean!
No, I don’t care if liches are the relatives or siblings of slugs–it’s normally impossible to learn skills from a lich, right? I feel that if I learn these skills, I might be able to increase the combat potential of our party. You should understand that with our current powers, we can’t handle powerful foes or a large number of enemies, right?
But… As a goddess, I can’t stand my servant learning the skills of a lich…
‘As a goddess’…? Um, I was almost destroyed when you used Turn Undead… Could it be, you’re a real goddess?
You could say that. You probably won’t spread this around, so I shall tell you. I’m Aqua. That’s right, the goddess revered by the Axis Sect, Aqua. Mind your manners, lich!
Eek!
Hey Wiz, I know that undead and goddesses are akin to oil and water, but you don’t need to fear her that much.
No, I don’t mean it that way… I heard that the Axis cultists have mental problems, so it’s best not to get involved with them–that’s part of the common sense of the world. And she said she was the goddess of that cult, so I…
Sor-Sorry!
… Sigh, the topic isn’t progressing at all…
Speaking of which, I heard recently that Kazuma-san’s party defeated Beldia-san.  That Beldia-san was a powerful swordsman among the Demon King’s Generals, you know? You guys are amazing.
‘That Beldia-san’? It sounds as if you were acquainted. Did you know each other because you’re both undead?
Ah, I didn’t make this clear before, I’m also a General of the Demon King’s army.
Catch her!
Wait! Aqua-sama, please let me explain!
This is great, Kazuma! We can clear our debts now! Not just that, we’ll become rich! Nevermind renting a place, we could even buy a mansion!
Hey Aqua, let’s hear her out… Um, what does being a General mean? If you are a spy of the Demon King, as adventurers, we can’t let you off…
That’s not it! I was asked by the Demon King-san to maintain the barrier to the Demon King’s castle! I’ve never harmed anyone before. You won’t get any rewards for defeating me!
… I don’t know what you’re saying, but we should play it safe and destroy you.
Wait a moment, Aqua-sama!
Eh, what do you mean? Is it like the cliché in video games, where the main character opens a path to the Demon King’s castle after defeating all the Generals? And Wiz is the one in charge of maintaining that barrier?
I don’t know what video games are, but that’s it! It was the Demon King who requested this of me. Because I didn’t want to stop running a shop in human territory, the only thing he asked me to do as a General was to maintain the barrier! He said no one would suspect that a General of the Demon King would set up a shop in a human town, so the barrier would be safe!
Which means humans can’t attack the Demon King’s castle if you’re alive. This will give us plenty of trouble. Kazuma, let’s do away with her.
Wait, please wait! With Aqua-sama’s power, you could easily break through the barrier created by 2 or 3 Generals! But there are 8 Generals in the Demon King’s army, so there will still be 6 Generals even if you defeat me. Even Aqua-sama can’t break through the barrier of 6 Generals! If you want to attack the Demon King’s castle, you’ll have to defeat the other Generals. I beg you, please don’t kill me before you take out the other Generals…! I have some things I need to take care of…
Eh, I think that should be fine. Even if we defeat Wiz now, the barrier would still be intact,  and the barrier can only be dispelled after all the Generals are defeated. But with Aqua here, we could break through the barrier without taking out all the Generals, right? Then we’ll just need to wait for someone to take out the other Generals other than Wiz.
But, would that really be okay? The Generals of the Demon King are Wiz’s acquaintances, right? Won’t you get angry at us for defeating Beldia?
… Beldia-san and I weren’t on great terms… He rolls his head under my skirt to peek at me whenever I took strolls. There’s only one person who was on good terms with me among the Generals, and that person probably won’t die so easily… Also–
As of now, I have decided to live as a human.
Eh, well then, I’ll display all the skills I have once, take note of anything you want to learn. You let me go the previous time too, so consider this as a sign of my gratitude…
What is it?
I can’t use my skills without a target. Which means… If no one can be my target…
Hey, Aqua, do it.
Ah? A mere undead wants to use her skills on me?
Eh… How about the skill Drain Touch? Ah, I’ll just drain a little health! For Kazuma-san to learn this skill, I just need to drain just a tiny bit to show the effect, and he’ll probably learn it!
It’s fine, no problem. Drain as much as you like, come!
Um, excuse me… Hmm? What’s happening?
Oh, my, is everything okay? Didn’t you want to drain my health and mana? Oh, my, you’re a top-tier undead, but you can’t even use Drain Touch?
What, what’s happening–!?
Ouch! Hey, don’t interrupt me Kazuma! This is a battle between a lich and a goddess! I’m an elite amongst the goddesses, how could I let her drain me so easily?!
Come on, I won’t be able to learn the skill like this, just let her drain a little… Sorry Wiz, this girl keeps on finding trouble with liches because of the nature of her job.
It’s, it’s fine! It’s, it’s because I’m a lich…
Well then, excuse me…
Um, Aqua-sama? It’s fine now, could you release your hand… The hand that you’re grabbing is turning numb, please let go!
Ah, Aqua-sama? Um, my hand is hot… Also, it hurts, it hurts! Aqua-sama, my body is gradually… Being purified and evaporating! I’m disappearing, Aqua-sama! I’ll disappear if this goes on!
What are you trying to do now?
Ouch!
Pardon my intrusion, is Wiz-san here?
Evil spirits?
No matter how we exorcise them, the evil spirits keep coming one after another. Nevermind selling the houses, just clearing the houses of spirits is a pain.
Before Wiz-san set up shop here, she was a powerful mage. Whenever the people in town ran into any difficulty, they would seek Wiz-san for aid. And Wiz-san seemed to be the expert on handling undead monsters. That’s why I’m here asking for her help.
But… Wiz-san seems unwell today. Your face had always been pale, but it’s even more so today. How should I put it, it feels as if you could disappear at any moment…?
No problems, leave it to me. We just need to settle the evil spirits in town, right?
Ah, no! I wasn’t planning on troubling Wiz-san to exorcise all the evil spirits in town… Just that mansion will be enough.
Ah, that mansion. I see…
Leave it to me. I just need to expel the spirits wandering in that mansion, correct?
Ah, ahhh! Wi-Wiz-san! Forget it, if you’re not feeling well, please don’t push yourself!
… This, this quest, please let us take it…
So, this is the mansion.
Not bad! This place is great! This is where someone like me should be staying in!
But can we really exorcise the evil spirits? I heard new spirits would keep coming back no matter how much you clear them.
But it feels like this place has not been occupied for a very long time. Didn’t the disturbance of the spirits only happen recently? Could it be, this mansion already had issues before the spirit problem hit the entire town…?
Yes, but even if this mansion had problems, we’ll be fine. We have Aqua with us, right? No worries, she’s an expert in fighting the undead.
Leave it to me! … Fufu, I can see it, I can see it! With my spiritual eyes, I see the noble, who was fooling around with a maid, and the child that the maid bore, who  was kept here as the illegitimate child of the noble clan! The noble died from illness, and the maid went missing. The young girl left here contracted the same disease as her father, and died without ever seeing the faces of her parents! Her name was Anna Filante Asteroid. The things she liked were her dolls and the stories of adventurers! But please don’t worry, this spirit won’t pull pranks on us. She will not harm us! Ara, she might be a child, but she liked mature things like drinking fine wine. So, prepare some wine as an offering!
… Hey, what do you think? I want to ask why this girl knows such unnecessary settings and names… Is she all right in the head? Or perhaps I judged her too hastily?
Ahhh!? Wahhhhhh!!
What is it!? Hey, Aqua, what happened! Are you okay!?
Boo… Wooo… Ka-Kazumaaahhh!
Well, what happened to you? Say something, why are you hugging a bottle? If you made that sound because you were drunk, I’ll wake you up with Create Water.
That’s not it! I didn’t drink the wine! This was my precious and valuable wine. I was looking forward to enjoying it after my bath! But it was empty when I returned to my room, ahhh!!
I see, good night, see you tomorrow.
Ahhh!? Wait, Kazuma! A spirit! This must be the work of an evil spirit! The wild spirits that congregated here, or the illegitimate child that was bound to this mansion! It must be either of these two! I’ll make my rounds around the mansion and destroy all the spirits I see!
… What happened, what’s with the ruckus?
Is something wrong? It’s getting late, so please behave yourself.
This girl said her wine was taken by evil spirits and wants to exorcise them now. I thought about saying, ‘Why would spirits want to drink spirits’. But there were too many things to pick apart, so I didn’t manage to. I think I’ll sleep now, so I’ll leave the rest to you.
…!
Hyaaa!!
Aqua! Aqua-sama!
Hyaaa!
Wahhh!
Don’t, don’t scare me Megumin, I almost pissed myself!
That, that’s my line! Why did Kazuma come to this room! I thought Aqua was coming back…!
And why were you in Aqua’s room? And where did Aqua go?
Ugh… Eh, there, there was a doll, eh, moving around my room…
And… Well… I wanted to ask Aqua to protect me… I wanted to ask her to take me to the ladies…
… So, you too…?
Kazuma was chased around by dolls too? I think Aqua and Darkness went out to exorcise the spirits.
… Aqua aside, even Darkness… Ah, that girl is a Crusader.
Kazuma, the noise outside the door seems to have stopped. Maybe the dolls aren’t there anymore?
Hey, Megumin, please face the door and cover your ears. Excuse me, but I’m going to relieve myself at the balcony…
Hey, what are you doing? Release me, or my trousers and the carpet in this room will be ruined!
I won’t let you go! How could I let you relieve yourself! Aren’t we comrades?! Whether it’s the toilet or anywhere, we’ll go together…!
Stop that you! Why are picking this moment to talk about being comrades! Didn’t you say that Crimson Demons don’t need to use the washroom?! How about… Look, there’s an empty wine bottle there, just use that!
You said something incredible! What do you want me to use that empty bottle for!? I won’t let you get your way! I can at least guard Kazuma’s back while you pee… That’s why, let’s use the bottle together…
Ahhhhhh!
Sniff… Kazuma, are you there? Don’t leave me, okay?
I’m here, of course I’m here, I won’t leave you even if the doll comes out, so hurry up.
… Um, Kazuma, it’s a bit embarrassing to go to the ladies’ room like this, could you loudly sing a song or something?
Why do I have to do something so embarrassing like sing a song in front of the toilet!? And we’ll run into the same situation if we camp outside or visit a dungeon, what will you do then?!
… Um, you can stop now, Kazuma. That was a weird song, I’ve never heard of that melody before. I’ve always wanted to ask… Where are you from, Kazuma?
I come from a wonderful nation called Japan that has the custom of singing before the toilet in the middle of the night. If you’re done, then come on, let’s link up with Aqua and Darkness.
Hey, what are you planning to chant! Are you planning to blow the whole house away?!
Megumin, charge out after the door is open. I just learned Drain Touch, so I can absorb some mana from the dolls! Even if the dolls attack me, I won’t die from that!
Come at me! If you have the guts then do it, evil spirits! My mad dog goddess will teach you a lesson later, ahhh!
Aqua! Hey Aqua, are you okay!
Yes, no more problems. There were plenty of evil spirits here. I worked until daybreak.
Hmm, I think we should report this to the guild. Although we didn’t take on this quest in the guild, this is a job for adventurers anyway. We might get some unexpected bounty for exorcising all the spirits in this mansion. I also want to know why there are so many spirits turning up in town suddenly.
Speaking of which, where was the illegitimate child you mentioned? Didn’t you say the spirits wouldn’t harm us?
Ahh! That child was present too! Don’t worry, this incident was caused by the wild spirits from other places. I think the one who drank my high-class wine was that illegitimate child of that noble! Hey, Kazuma, could we bill that wine under necessary expenses…
Good morning. It’s a bit early, but I have something to report, is it convenient?
No problem, may I ask what is it?
There are many who are seeking help due to the spread of the evil spirits. Since you’ve successfully repelled the monsters, we should give you some bounty rewards. Thank you for your hard work.
Sorry for taking your time, but we’ve found out why the evil spirits were wandering around; here’s the report. There’s a public cemetery in Axel town, right? I don’t know who played a prank, creating a giant holy barrier on that cemetery. The spirits in the cemetery had nowhere to go, so they had to go to town and haunt houses where no one was living in…
Excuse me for a moment.
Hey, you have some clue, right? Tell me!
… Yes. Didn’t Wiz ask me to periodically visit the cemetery to send the lost spirits to the other world? But going there every now and then is a real hassle, right? So, I thought if I chased all the spirits in the cemetery away and let them wander around, they would dissipate naturally over time…
… We won’t claim the reward from the guild, understood?
… Yes.
After this, we’ll head over to the property estate and apologize, since what we did was just like fraud.
… Yes. I’m very sorry.
Ara ara, I was worried and came to look. I didn’t expect all the evil spirits to be exorcized!
I see… But if it’s possible, could you please stay here from now on? This house is too big, and there are more evil spirits here than other places, so it has a bad reputation…
We’re very sorry!
Ahh, it’s fine it’s fine! Please raise your heads. Well then, it’s settled–all of you will stay here for now. To dispose of so many spirits proves that you are powerful adventurers. Providing support for adventurers is the obligation of the citizens in this town. And if you continue to live here, the bad reputation of the mansion would gradually fade away…
Ahh, enough, stop doing that!
After finishing your adventures, or when eating dinner, you have to chat about your adventures with your companions… That’s a strange condition, but it’s not very hard.
Kazuma-san, morning! Are you cleaning the tomb?
Are you all right? Sorry that idiot gave you so much trouble yesterday.
Don’t worry, or rather, it’s great it has been settled this way. She definitely won’t be lonely now.
Kazuma! Lunch is ready, come quick! If you don’t come over now, your food will get cold!
I know, wait a moment, I’ll be right there!
Kazuma! Megumin says that for every minute you’re late, there’ll be one less piece of fried meat! Take your time, you don’t need to hurry, our lunch will be more bountiful that way.
Wait for me, how could you brutes do that?!
Hey, move away, I’m doing some freelance work now. If it’s cold, go back to your room and hide under your blanket.
I don’t wanna. Things like blankets become cold when you leave it. If you want me to go back into it, then heat it up in a microwave first.
Are you stupid? There’s no such thing as a microwave here! And stop being stubborn, move out of the way! Who do you think landed us into debt in the first place? If you continue to get in my way, don’t blame me if I get rough with you.
What, you want to fight? If we’re both unarmed, I’ll have the advantage with my higher stats. The place before the fireplace is my holy sanctuary, anyone who invades it will receive divine punishment, ahhh!!
Hmph… This is now my territory. If you don’t want to help me with work, be a good girl and play with those two over there.
Hmph, witness the power of my army. I teleport my orc soldier to this space.
Megumin, the way you use your mage is disgusting… I’ll move my Crusader here, check!
Teleport.
Kazuma, look carefully at the level column! Right now, I have the highest level among the four of us. With such a high level, I could be considered a veteran! You rookies who are below level 20 know your place! If you understand, then offer the place before the fireplace to the great me!
… Hey, Aqua. Your level did increase, but your stats are the same as the first time I saw them. Why is that?
How ignorant, Kazuma. Who do you think I am? Things like stats were already at the maximum from the very start. My skill points were bountiful at the beginning, enough to learn all the banquet party tricks and all the skills of an Archpriest. Comparing me to a normal adventurer is a big mistake.
Oh? Why did you give up the place so obediently… Kazuma, why are you crying? Did my level exceeding yours give you such a big shock? Why… Why are you patting my shoulders and treating me so gently? Why are you looking at me with eyes of sympathy?
Keith, Dust, what are you doing here?
Woah!
Wh-What, it’s just Kazuma, don’t scare us like that. Really, I hate people who use Lurk skills like this…
Hi. What’s up? You’re not with those three today?
Nope, it’s just me today, don’t worry. Are you that bad with them? I was just bored at home and decided to take a stroll. What are you guys doing here?
No, it’s… Because we… You understand? Anyway, it’s fine that they’re not here. Or rather, it’s great that there are no ladies around.
Kazuma who’s usually surrounded by beauties doesn’t need such things, but for lonely men like Dust and me…
Hey, wait.
Keith… This guy’s situation isn’t what you imagined. It might look like a harem at first glance, but it’s not like that… He’s in the same state as us and has endured much hardship.
Sigh– there’s nothing to do this season. I’m bored out of my mind. Oh, Kazuma can really drink. Here, another glass!
Sigh… When winter comes, I want to stick close to someone… To be honest, I know how hard it is on Kazuma. But even so, I still envy you this season.
Right, speaking of which, what were the two of you doing there just now?
Kazuma, I think you can be trusted. What I’m about to say is a secret among the male adventurers in this town. Kazuma, can you promise to never reveal this secret to your female party members?
Kazuma, there are succubi operating a shop in this town. You know that they specialize in gifting wonderful dreams to others, right?
Please tell me more.
There’s a group of succubi living in this town. This type of devil specializes in absorbing the irrepressible lust of humans, which is the energy men use to sustain themselves. Hence, male humans are an absolutely necessary existence for them.
That’s why they’ll absorb our energy, but… The male adventurers in this town have a relationship of mutual assistance. Think about it… We’re basically staying in stables. Hence… There are many things that are hard to vent, right? With so many other adventurers sleeping around us, even if you’re in the mood, you can’t do ‘anything’ about it, right?
Yes, you’re right.
But we can’t lay a hand on the female adventurers sleeping near us. If you did that, you would be discovered by the other female adventurers who would gang up on you. Or your target might be hiding a dagger and you would risk getting castrated. Things like that do happen.
Your trauma when you made a move on Lynn has not yet recovered?
Sh-shut up! Like I said… At times like this, the succubo comes to mind. When we’re sleeping, they’ll use the chance to show us a wonderful and exciting dream. We’ll be refreshed and they can sustain themselves. And they know how to hold back and won’t absorb so much that we become unable to continue adventuring. I’ve never heard of any adventurers falling into danger because too much of their energy was taken… How about it? Everybody wins, right?
Actually, I only heard about this shop from others recently. We were planning to visit that shop for the first time today, and then we met Kazuma.
And that’s the story… How about it? Want to go togeth-
Please bring me with you.
Welcome–!
Dear customers, is this your first time visiting us?
… Well then, do you know what kind of shop this is, and who we are?
Please place your orders. It’s fine if you don’t order anything either… And please fill in the necessary information on the survey form and hand it in to the cashier when paying your bill.
May I ask, what’s this part about our own status, gender and appearance in our dream…?
The status part means being, for example, a king or hero in the dream. As for gender and appearance, there are occasionally customers who want to experience how it feels like to be a woman; there are some who want to be a young boy and be forced upon by a strong female adventurer.
… Excuse me, for the setting of the target, how detailed can we be?
It can be as detailed as you wish. Personality, favorite phrases, appearance, how much she likes you, any feature and any figure. It’s fine even if you asked for a fictional character.
Are you serious?
I’m serious.
… Excuse me, but wouldn’t we be violating any copyrights?
No problem, it’s a dream after all.
I thought so.
… That means, there are no age restrictions on the targets? No, I’m not thinking about any specific age group, but, how should I put this…
None, please choose as you please.
Is, is that really okay? What about laws…
No problem, it’s just a dream.
That’s true.
Well then, all three honored customers chose the three-hour session. The fee is 5,000 Eris each.
…To us, we just need enough money to live on in this town as humans. Apart from this, we just need to absorb a little energy from our customers.
Goddess… Ah, goddess…
Don’t, don’t act like that, how inauspicious! Well then, please leave the address you’ll be spending tonight at, and what time you plan to sleep. Around that time, the succubus from our shop will go to the side of the sleeping customers and let them see their desired dreams. Please don’t drink alcohol if possible. If you get dead drunk or sleep too deeply, even we won’t be able to let the customer dream.
Well, let’s meet again.
Yeah, will do!
See you next time!
Kazuma, you’re back! Here’s something you should be happy about; tonight’s dinner is going to be splendid! It’s crab! Darkness’s folks sent someone over, saying that if Darkness was going to stay here from now on, they should send a gift, and that’s the super extravagant Snow Crimson Crab! And a magnificent top-class wine too! They wanted to thank us for taking care of their daughter!
Wahhh… In an impoverished career as adventurers, I never thought there would be a day I would see a Snow Crimson Crab…! I’m glad I joined this party…
Is the crab that great in quality?
Of course! I’ll give you a simple example, if someone told me, ‘If you want to eat this crab, then you are prohibited from using Explosion’, I would endure it, and wait until I eat my fill before using Explosion. That’s how valuable it is!
Oh, that’s impressive… Hmm? What was that last part again?
!
Kazuma Kazuma, use Tinder here. I’ll show you the most delicious way of drinking this top-class wine.
Fuu…
This is great, splendid!
Darkness, I want some too! It’s fine, just for today! I want to drink some wine!
No, they say those who start to drink when young will grow up and become useless adults.
…? Why are you looking at me?
… Are you okay, Kazuma? You’ve never drank before? Or… Does my crab not suit your taste?
No, the crab was delicious, there’s no problem there. It’s just that I had a round with Keith and the guys during the day. And I can’t tell the deliciousness of the wine yet, so I’ll pass today… Tomorrow then! I’ll drink tomorrow!
Oh–? You think there will still be wine left tomorrow? I’ll drink it all! How could I leave any behind! That’s great, I will drink Kazuma’s share too!
… Hmm, all right. Have more crab then; thank you for taking care of me all this while.
All right, it might be early, but I’m retiring to bed. Darkness, thank you for your treat. Good night everyone!
But such scenarios only happen in mangas.
Wahh! Why did the lamp suddenly…?
… Oh well, fortunately, the moon is out tonight, so this is…
Hmm… The moon tonight is really…
… Why…? Why, why…? Why, why, why…!?
…? What’s the matter, Darkness? Come over here and help me wash my back.
?
You, you, you, what are you saying!? No, that, why, why are you so calm, and what do you mean by washing your back!? Too many things are happening, it’s overloading my brain…!
No, now’s not the time to feel moved. I didn’t add the setting of being unwilling, so hurry… No, I did request for a beautiful onee-san with a great figure, a little shy and unworldly. If that’s the case, then she’s acting properly, right?
!
Can’t be helped. I know your settings are to be naive, but please wash my back now.
! Could, could it be… Under such circumstances, me helping you wash your back is common sense?
How refreshing and nice, but please hurry up. It’s hard to restrain myself, in more than one way.
You, you little…! Do you understand the situation? If Aqua and Megumin find out about this, what would they say…?!
If that happens, let’s just all take a bath together.
What’s with you!? What’s wrong with you today!?
Hey, you’re being loud. Do you know what time it is? You’ll disturb the neighbors, you know? There should be a limit to how much common sense you lack.
Why are you bringing up common sense in such a situation!? Am, am I the one who’s wrong? Because I lack knowledge about the world? Do I lack common sense? Am I… Weird?
In a way, you’ve always been weird. No, since this is a dream, being a little noisy is fine… All right, I’ll be troubling you with this.
Ugh… Why, why did it become like this… But, ordering me so haughtily, I can’t resist; I really hate my fetish right now…
You, you little…! You’re acting just like a middle-aged man today! Done, this should be enough. I can go now, right…?
What are you saying. Even with the settings adjusted, you still lack common sense. Don’t you know what to do next? Without using the towel, you…
That’s too weird, too weird! No matter how ignorant I am, I know this is definitely not normal!
Intruder–! Everyone come quick! There’s an intruder in the mansion–!
Kazuma, look! A villain was stopped by my barrier and couldn’t move… Wait, there’s another villain!
Who are you calling a villain…! Wait, what’s this? What’s a succubus doing there?
I’ve set a powerful barrier in this mansion. I rushed over because there was a reaction in the barrier, and found this succubus that was trying to sneak into the place! Succubi will attack men, so she must be here for Kazuma! But don’t worry, I’ll perform an exorcism and dispose of her!
All right then, accept your fate! I’ll use my super skill for killing devils… Kazuma, you’re a guy, so don’t come too close! The succubus might control you…
Wait, wait! Kazuma, what are you doing? She’s a devil, she’s here to suck Kazuma’s energy!
So-Sorry esteemed customer! Please leave me alone, I’m just a monster! I didn’t expect a barrier to be here, but getting to the side of the customers is what we are good at. Things turned out this way because I was too immature and failed to infiltrate. I can’t let the customer embarrass themselves, so let them dispose of me as a random wandering succubus. Customer, you just need to pretend you know nothing at all!
Customer?
… Hey, what are you doing? I’m a goddess, after all. I can’t let that devil get away so easily. Kazuma, get out of my way if you don’t want to get trashed!
Aqua, Kazuma might be bewitched and under the succubus’s control! Kazuma’s has been acting weirdly for awhile! And he was saying something about dreams and settings, so that’s probably it! Damn, that imposturous succubus, letting me taste such… Humiliation…! I’ll kill her!
Kazuma, are you insane? No matter how cute she is, she’s still a devil. She’s a monster. Get a hold of yourself, that’s an enemy we need to defeat.
Looks like I have to fight seriously…! All right, bring it on! I’ll give Kazuma a good beating and send that succubus to meet her maker!
Cu-Customer–!
Bring it on–!
Hey, say something. Or rather, you were also at fault for going along in the heat of the moment.
…! ……
… You really don’t remember what happened last night? You were under the control of the succubus, so you forgot everything, right?
Yes. Regrettably, I can’t remember anything. I only remember having a nice dream.
I-I see. That’s great… Um, it can’t be helped. It was just an accident, so I should forget about it too… But, your attitude was so firm back then… it was a bit scary, but not bad either. But saying strange things to the naive me is wrong.
I should say, you’re not a real gullible daughter from a wealthy family, so you should really learn more about the world. No matter how you look at it, I didn’t do anything wrong this time. I lit the lantern and hung the ‘In Use’ sign. If not for the prank pulled by someone…
… Wait, you actually do remember what happened last night, right? Didn’t you act that way because you were under the control of the succubus?
Destroyer alert! Destroyer alert! The mobile fortress Destroyer is approaching this town! All adventurers please prepare for combat and report to the adventurer’s guild! The citizens in town, please evacuate immediately–!
We need to run! As far away as possible!
There’s no point in panicking now. Since everything including our home will be lost, we might as well challenge the Demon King’s castle directly.
Hey… What’s with the two of you? The guild issued an emergency broadcast, so let’s put on our equipment and head over.
Kazuma, what nonsense are you saying? Don’t tell me you want to fight the Mobile Fortress Destroyer?
Kazuma, the thing that’s approaching the town is renowned for destroying everything except devotees of the Axis Cult. The ultimate bounty target, the Mobile Fortress Destroyer. Taking that thing on would be reckless.
Hey, why are you speaking about my believers in such a way? Wiz said something like that too, why are you so afraid of my children? They’re all good and normal people!
Can’t Megumin’s Explosion take care of that thing? Its name seems to imply that it’s large, so it should be visible from afar. Just blow it away with magic.
It won’t work, the Destroyer has a powerful magic barrier. It’d have no problems blocking a couple of explosion spells.
Hey, my believers are really good kids! Listen to me, Megumin! The disparaging rumors you hear on the streets are spread by those black-hearted Eris devotees! Everyone beautifies Eris too much, but don’t be fooled, there are times when she behaves unruly! She’s even more unreasonable than me when facing devils, and her personality is rather free spirited! She might even go to the mortal realm to play in her free time! Axis Cult! Please support the Axis Cult!
Aqua, you’re not just satisfied with proclaiming yourself to be a goddess, now you’re even bad-mouthing Goddess Eris now. Beware of divine retribution.
It’s not self-proclaimed! Can you just believe me–!
Weird, where did Darkness run off to? She should’ve come back before me.
She charged back into her room.
… Sorry for making you wait! … Hmm? What is it Kazuma, hurry and prepare yourself. Going by your nature, you’ll definitely go to the guild, right?
Hey, you two, learn from her! After living in this mansion and town for so long, don’t you have any attachment to it? Hurry, we’re going to the guild!
… Kazuma, why are you so hot-blooded today? The light shining in your eyes is too bright. And we’ve only lived in this mansion for just one day…
Oh! You’re here, Kazuma! I knew you would come!
I had faith you would be here too.
Thank you everyone for responding to the emergency announcement today! We’ll now start the emergency quest to repel the Destroyer. There are no level or job restrictions, so we hope everyone will take part. When the guild judges the quest to be a failure, we’ll abandon the entire town and escape together. All of you here are the last line of defense for the town. We’re counting on you!
Well then, everyone, we’ll start the emergency war council. Please take a seat!
All right, I’ll brief everyone on the current situation! Um… First, is there anyone who needs me to explain what the Mobile Fortress Destroyer is?
The Mobile Fortress Destroyer is a gigantic golem, built by the magically advanced nation Norse, to fight against the Demon King’s army. Using their national budget and depleting their vaults, they constructed a colossal spider-shaped golem the size of a small castle. Because it utilizes large quantities of magic metals, it’s far lighter than it looks, and can move faster than a horse.
Worth mentioning is its enormous body and attack speed. Even a large-sized monster would be turned into mush if it got stepped on by its eight agile legs. The torso uses the fruit of Norse’s accumulated technology to project a large magic barrier over it at all times. That means magic attacks are pointless.
Spells are ineffective, so we can only attack physically… We’ll be squashed if we get near, so, we can only use ranged attacks like arrows and catapults… But the golem is crafted from magic metals, arrows would just bounce off. As for siege catapults, it would be hard to use them with the speed of the mobile fortress. To guard against aerial attacks from monsters, mid-sized golems are situated on the body of the Destroyer. Those use small ballistae to shoot down objects flying towards the mobile fortress. In addition, combat golems are also garrisoned on top of the torso.
The reason the Mobile Fortress Destroyer went out of control was because the director in charge of developing it occupied the mobile fortress. That researcher is still issuing orders from the heart of the golem till this very day… With its incredible speed and all terrain capability, there are no places on this continent which hasn’t been rampaged by it. As it does not discriminate between men or monsters, the rampaging mobile fortress is known as the Destroyer. Whenever the Destroyer draws near, the official procedure of the guild is to abandon the town, wait for the Destroyer to pass through, and rebuild the town. It’s being treated as a natural catastrophe.
Right now, the Destroyer is towards the northwest of this town, heading straight for us… All right everyone, please give your suggestions!
… Excuse me, what happened to the magically advanced nation Norse? A country capable of creating that thing should be able to build something to fight against it, right? And they might know the weakness of the mobile fortress too…
… Any other suggestions?
To deal with that thing, we should dig a giant trap near the town…
It has been attempted before. A certain place gathered a lot of ‘elemental masters’, summoning the spirits of the earth to dig a big hole, and the Destroyer fell in successfully. Everything was going as planned until this moment… But the Destroyer was highly mobile and jumped right out of the hole. Their plan included throwing down boulders to seal the hole, but they couldn’t execute that in time.
… Any other ideas?
How did the Demon King’s army handle the Destroyer? Is the Demon King’s castle safe from its rampage? How did they protect themselves from the Destroyer’s attack? They should be troubled too.
Their castle has a powerful magic barrier around it; the scale is beyond that of humans. Right now, the Demon King’s castle seems unharmed, so they have no plans on taking down the Destroyer. They aren’t concerned with wild monsters getting trampled.
Any other suggestions?
Hey Kazuma, you’re quick witted, do you have any good ideas?
Hey Aqua. Wiz said that with your power, you could break through even with 2 or 3 generals maintaining the barrier, right? In that case, the Destroyer’s barrier should…… Wahh! What’s this–!?
Right, she did say that. But I never tried it before so there’s no guarantee that I can really break the barrier.
Ahhh! What a pity! Why did you destroy it?!
Why are you shouting? I already finished it, that’s why I’m wiping it away and drawing a new one…
There’s a way to break the barrier?! The Destroyer’s barrier?
No, I just thought it might work, she said there’s no guarantee either.
Anyway, could you please give it a try? If it works, we can attack with magic…! Ah, but low-level spells are useless against that mobile fortress. All the adventurers in this town are novices, our mages are lacking in firepower…
Don’t we have someone with amazing firepower? The one with a screw loose.
That’s right, the one that’s wrong in the head…!
We have that screwy girl…!
Hey, stop. If you’re referring to me, then use my name, all right? If not, I’ll prove right here how wrong my brain is.
Ughh… Even with my explosion spell, I might not be able to finish it off in one shot…
Sorry I’m late…! I’m the owner of the magic item shop, Wiz. Technically, I’m an adventurer, please let me help too…
It’s the shop owner!
The impoverished owner is here!
Shop owner, thank you for taking care of me in my dreams!
The shop owner is here! We’ll win! We’ll definitely win!
Why is Wiz so famous? Why is she so popular? And don’t call her an impoverished owner all right, that’s so pitiful. Is her business really that bad?
Don’t you know? Wiz-san was originally a famous mage. She was a renowned powerful Archwizard, disappearing for some time after retirement before suddenly showing up in this town to set up shop. Wiz-san’s business isn’t good because most of the adventurers in this town are novices who can’t afford the expensive magic items in her shop. She would have better business if her shop was in the capital. We don’t need to fight powerful enemies, so we have no use for pricey potions and magic items. Everyone drops by the shop just to see the beautiful shop owner, but nobody really buys anything.
Hello everyone, I’m the shop owner of Wiz’s Magic Item Shop, please take care of me… I’m the shop owner, please visit my shop. My shop is still in the red…!
Shop owner of Wiz’s Magic Item Shop, it’s been a while! On behalf of all the staff in the guild, I welcome you! This way please!
With the shop owner here, let’s continue our strategy meeting! Since she just arrived, I’ll summarize the current situation… First, the Archpriest Aqua-san will dispel the Destroyer’s barrier. Next the screw… Megumin-san will cast the explosion spell at the Destroyer. That’s the plan so far.
… It would be better to target the legs with the explosion spell. The Destroyer has four legs attached to its body on either side, so Megumin-san and I will take one side each, is that okay? If we take out the legs of the mobile fortress, it’ll be easier to handle…
Well then, the plan is to attack the legs with Explosion after the barrier is dismissed. In the event the legs aren’t destroyed, all the vanguard adventurers, please equip weapons such as war hammers and remain on standby around the path the Destroyer will be taking. Be prepared to attack the legs and take them out. The researcher who made the Destroyer is probably still in the fortress, so he might make a move too. To counter that, the guild has prepared arrows with ropes tied to them for the archers to use. Everyone with light armour, please be ready to invade the fortress!
Hey Darkness. I’m telling you this for your own good, so retreat for now. I know how tough your defense is, but this is still pushing it. It wouldn’t do any good for you to stand here. Just let go of your useless fetish and wait at the side of the road with me, all right?
Kazuma… I’ve always acted this way, so it’s only natural for you to think so… But do you really think I’m a woman who would be lost in my own desires even in such an emergency?
Of course, isn’t that obvious?
… I’m a Crusader. And aside from that, I have other reasons compelling me to protect this town. I might share that reason with you one of these days.
I can’t explain now, but I have an obligation to protect the citizens of this town. The townsfolk might not think so, but I believe it to be so. Hence, no matter how reckless this might be, I won’t take a single step away from this position.
You’re really stubborn sometimes.
… Do you dislike stubborn companions?
A certain Archpriest frustrates me when she’s being stubborn, but the stubbornness you’re showing right now isn’t bad.
… I see.
I couldn’t convince her. To protect that rock headed pervert, we need to complete our assigned tasks.
I-I-I understand…! I-I must do my best! I, I-I-I’ll definitely succeed…!
Hey, calm down. If things turn bad, I’ll strip her of her heavy armour with Steal and drag her away!
Woah, there’s smoke rising out from your head, are you okay? What skill is this? Are you doing party tricks?
No, Aqua-sama… It’s because the weather is very good today, so this is what happens after basking in the sun for too long…
Attention all adventurers, the Mobile Fortress Destroyer is about to appear before us. Citizens, please evacuate the town! Adventurers, please get ready for battle!
What’s with this, it’s too big…
Hey, this is way too much. Will it be okay? This is impossible!
Create Earth Golem!
Big! And fast! It’s scarier than I imagined!
Incoming–! Keep your head down! Don’t move in front of the Destroyer, you’ll get crushed!
Hey Wiz! It’ll work, right? Is it really okay?!
No problem, leave it to me, Aqua-sama. I’m a lich after all, one of the top-tier undead. If Aqua-sama can dispel the barrier, you can leave the rest to me! If we fail… We can return to dust happily together.
Are you kidding me? You’re joking, right?
Hey, relax. Even if it fails, no one will blame you. We just need to abandon the town and run away then, so don’t think too much about this.
Don’t-Don’t-Don’t worry! I-I-I’ll use Explosion to blast-blast-blast it into dust!
It’s coming–! Prepare for battle–!
Aqua! Now! Do it!
Sacred Break Spell!
Wiz, I’m counting on you! Please take out the legs on your side!
Hey, is your love for explosion magic a lie? You keep talking about Explosion this, Explosion that; it would be ugly if you lost to Wiz. Is your Explosion a joke spell that can’t even blow that thing up?
What, what did you say!? What you just said was even worse than making fun of my name!
Explosion–!
Ugh… It’s regrettable… As expected of a lich. Seems my level isn’t high enough to win against Wiz’s explosion magic…
I, I don’t want to lose… Next, next time… I’ll definitely…!
Good girl, you did great. Wiz is a powerful lich, it’s normal that she bested you. Just work harder next time. Look, we accomplished our objective, well done.
Once more…! Another chance! I’ll definitely prove my explosion is the strongest…!
Let, let go, stop that! Don’t pull my pants! I get it, you’re the best in terms of explosion! It must be because of something, that’s right, because your condition wasn’t too good! All right, when you recover your mana, I’ll look at your explosion spell, so rest quietly in a safe place!
We did it! What’s with that, I thought it would be powerful with an incredible name like Mobile Fortress Destroyer, but what a letdown. All right, let’s go back and have a beer! I wonder how much the reward for taking down such a target would be?
You idiot! Why do you like to act in such a clichéd manner!? If you blurt something like that…!
…? Wh, what happened, why is there a tremor?
This machine has stopped operation. This machine has stopped operation. Unable to expend unused energy and vent heat. Operators, please evacuate from the machine. This machine has…
Look at what you’ve done! Why do you always have to drag us down after accomplishing something?!
Wait! Wait okay! This isn’t my fault! I didn’t even do anything this time!
Hey, what’s with that announcement? Would it be bad to continue staying here?
It’s just a guess, but I think it’ll explode if this goes on.
The, the shop… If this goes on, it would be disastrous for the town, the shop will, will disappear…
This machine has stopped operation. This machine has stopped operation. Unable to expend unused energy and vent heat. Operators, please evacuate from the machine. This machine has…
… I want to attack.
… Me too. I remembered the reason why I stayed in this novice town despite being over level 30.
That shop has been taking care of us with its low prices, if we don’t repay them back now, there won’t be a next time!
This machine has stopped operation. This machine has…
Those in favor of infiltrating the Mobile Fortress Destroyer, raise your hands–!
Charge–!
Wahh… Kazuma, I’m a bit afraid of that group of people… From the looks of things, it should be enough to leave everything to them. Let’s go back, all right? We’ll return for now, and work hard from tomorrow onward.
How could we go back now, you moron? Can’t you tell how brave the heroes invading the fortress are!? Your job is just beginning. If you don’t want to be treated like a fake goddess, then heal these brave warriors properly.
Darkness, your armour’s too heavy, I don’t think you can climb up! Megumin, continue to rest! Wiz, please act according to your own judgement! Aqua, this is your fault, so follow me!
Wait! I have nothing to do with this!
Surround those golems! Overwhelm them with numbers and topple them with ropes! Hammer them when they’re down!
Asshole! You’re in there, right!? Open the door or I’ll smash it with my hammer!
Come out now! Get the one in charge out here right now! I’ll teach you a lesson!
A big one’s heading your way–!
Hey Aqua, let me show you something interesting. This should be the best way to use this skill.
Steal!
Kazuma, wait!
… Hya–! My hand! My handdddd–!
Ahhh! Are you all right, Kazuma-san? When facing a monster carrying heavy objects, do not use Steal!
Aqua… It’s fractured right, it must be fractured.
There’s no fracture at all. I’ll heal you up, but don’t let it get into your head and act recklessly, okay?
It’s open–!
Oh, Kazuma, you came at the right time… Look at that.
He has already passed on. He won’t turn into an undead, he had no regrets at all.
No, he should have had some reason to linger in this world. From the look of things, he must’ve died alone…
– O month X day. The higher ups of the country gave me a tough problem, asking me to create a mobile weapon. Impossible. They wouldn’t listen to my protests, and ignored my apologies and requests. I wanted to resign, but they wouldn’t accept my resignation letter. I pretended to be retarded, streaking around in my underwear, but the female researchers simply asked me to take off my underwear too. This nation is going to end.
– O month X day. The deadline for the design is today. What should I do? I couldn’t just submit a blank paper. Why did I start drinking out of desperation and spend all the funds away? As I was feeling frustrated staring at the blank design plans, a spider, something I absolutely hate, showed up on the paper. I screamed shrilly and picked something up to smash it. The spider is now stained onto the design paper… The economy is bad, and high-quality paper like this is expensive; I don’t have the money to compensate for it. Screw it, I’ll just submit this.
– O month X day. That design was unexpectedly well liked. I don’t dare to tell them ‘That was the goo that spurted out when I squashed a spider, why are you touching it?’. And is it fine for the project to carry on like this? What should I do? The only thing I did was kill a spider, and they made me the director. Yahoo!
– O month X day. I didn’t do anything and the weapon is still taking shape. I’m not needed at all, right? Whatever, just do what you want, I just want to live my life leisurely… When they came to ask me about the power source, I couldn’t be bothered. I said from the start that it was impossible, if you want a power source then get me that super rare legendary ore rumored to be able to burn for eternity–the Coronatite, or I rebuked them. That felt great! Bring it to me if you can.
– O month X day. They actually brought it to me. What should I do? They really did it. They’re even placing it in the power reactor, what should I do? What the hell should I do? I only said it because I thought it was impossible, and they actually did it. What if it doesn’t move? What would happen to me? Death penalty? If it doesn’t move, will I be sentenced to death? You have to move, please.
– O month X day. They said the activation test would be tomorrow, but to be honest, I didn’t do anything. The only thing I did was squash a spider. This’ll be the last day I can sit on this chair so leisurely… I start feeling mad when I think about it. Forget it, I’ll just drink. This is my last supper, so I won’t hold back! There wasn’t anyone left in the machine today, so it won’t matter how much I drink or how drunk I get. I’ll start drinking the most expensive wine!
– O month X day. When I woke up, I felt a strong tremor. What’s happening? How much did I drink? I don’t remember anything. No, I don’t remember anything about yesterday at all. The only parts I remember was heading to the central zone and lecturing the Coronatite. No, wait. After that, I said I wanted to test its courage and flicked the lighted cigarette onto the ore…
– O month X day. I finally realized what was happening; I’m doomed. The mobile weapon is running amok right now. What should I do? They would certainly think it was my doing, so I’m probably a wanted criminal right now. They wouldn’t forgive me even if I cried and begged… How irritating… They would probably destroy the mobile weapon, drag me out and execute me. Damn the king and the officials, and that female researcher who smirked after taking off my underwear, they’re all scum! It’s fine for such a country to fall. Enough, I’ll just drink and sleep. Fortunately, the food and wine are plentiful, I’ll think about this after I wake up.
– O month X day. The nation has fallen. Oh no, it has fallen, it’s really gone! The citizens and high officials have all fled. But I destroyed my home country. Oh no, this feels great! I’m satisfied, I have no regrets. All right, I’ve decided. I’ll live out the rest of my life in this machine, I can’t alight or stop it anyway. The one who made this thing must be retarded… Oh wait! The one in charge of creating this thing was me!
… That’s, that’s all.
Are you kidding me!?
This is the Coronatite. So, how do we take this out?
What should we do…? Ah, right, I remember there was a guy with a magic sword, what was his name again…?
Hey, we don’t need to cut the fence open, this’ll work fine. If it’s this close, the fence won’t matter… Steal!
Ahhh! Ka-Kazuma-san!
Hotttttt!
Freeze! Freeze!
Heal! Heal! Hey… Are you an idiot? Kazuma’s usually quick witted, but you’re doing the same thing even after the incident with the golem!? You’re actually stupid, right?!
This is bad, there’s no time; it’s about to blow. What should we do with this thing…?
Hey Aqua, do you have any way to seal this thing? Isn’t it the norm for a goddess to seal the power of evil or something!?
I know what you’re getting at, but that’s just a game trope! Hey Wiz, you have a way to deal with this, right!?
There is a method… But my mana is insufficient. Sorry Kazuma-san, I need your help!
What, what is it?
Can you let me suck a little?
It would be my pleasure.
Thank you! Well then, I’ll start sucking!
Ahhh!
Stop, stop! If you take any more Kazuma will become a mummy!
Now, I can use teleportation spells! But… The problem is where to send this thing to… The places I can teleport include Axel, the capital, and the dungeon. Which one should I choose…
In that case, wouldn’t the dungeon be fine?
But… The dungeon I registered as a teleport marker is a place I’ll visit to collect magical ingredients, the world’s largest dungeon… Right now, that place is a tourist attraction with the dungeon as the main selling point…!
That’s just looking for trouble! Hey, this is bad! The ore is going beyond red and turning white!
Theoretically, there’s another way! There’s a spell called Random Teleport, which sends things to an unspecified place! But we won’t know where it would be sent to. It would be fine if it was sent to the mountains or sea. But if it was sent to a place with a dense population…!
Don’t worry! The world is huge! Compared to a place with lots of people, the chance of it ending up somewhere with nobody around is higher! Don’t worry, I’ll take all the responsibility! I might look this way, but my luck is incredibly good!
Teleport–!
How was it? Where did the Coronatite go? Is it nearby?
Hey Darkness. We already stopped the heart of the Destroyer, it’s over. Ah–I’m dead tired, let’s go back to the mansion, we’ll eat something good tonight.
It’s not over yet. I can smell a strong enemy and the stench of danger… That thing is still a threat!
What’s happening now? What’s going on with that thing?!
Calm, calm, calm down! At such a time, it should be something like this! You have to cut the red wire or white wire, right?!
No, you’re talking about a bomb! We’re discussing why the Destroyer is still moving even though the core has been removed!
What, what should we do!? It’s probably the heat accumulated inside being vented! I can’t teleport something so big! And look at the front of the Destroyer, there’s a crack due to the power of the explosion spell, right? Heat’s escaping from there! If this continues, the heat will spray into the town…
I don’t want to hear this! Kazuma-san–Kazuma-san–! Quick, think of something–!
Ma-Mana! Can someone share some mana with me! If I cast an explosion spell at that crack, it would neutralize the impact!
Hey, Wiz! What are you saying! The other adventurers don’t know you can use Drain Touch! What would you do if they discovered that you’re a lich! As a human, I can let them inspect me even if I use lich skills, but if they found out that Wiz wasn’t a human, it would be the end!
But, I can only stop that explosion by absorbing mana…!
I can use it too. So, I’ll absorb mana from someone else and transfer it to Wiz. It’ll take an additional step, but that’s the only way.
Hey, Darkness, don’t say such stubborn things, let’s escape! As far as we can go! And we’ll start over… Wait, thinking carefully, our debts are being cushioned by the guild in this town, so if this place gets destroyed…!
Hey, the one that proclaims to be a something, get over here.
Hey, what are you doing?! I don’t have time for you Kazuma. Let’s just, hyaaa–!?
You hikiNEET, what are you doing to me during an emergency!?
I’m only doing this because it’s an emergency! Listen carefully! I’ll be transferring your mana to Wiz later, to let her cast Explosion at the Destroyer! That should resolve the crisis!
I don’t wanna! Why must I share my mana with an undead! And Wiz will definitely be purified if large quantities of my holy mana are transferred to her!
Um… When I absorbed just a bit of Aqua-sama’s mana the other time, my physical condition deteriorated…
The main character’s turn.
Are you listening to me? Don’t absorb too much, okay? Don’t absorb too much!
I know, I know, this is the request of the goddess of parties, right? Don’t worry, leave it to me!
No! I’m not joking here!
Kazuma-san, choosing places where the skin is thinner allows for you to absorb and transfer more mana! And the source of mana is the heart. So, the closer it is to the heart, the more efficient it’ll be!
I’m ready, you can start anytime! Two explosions in one day, today is really–wahhh!
What are you doing so suddenly?! Putting your cold hands on my back, I thought my heart was cramping! What is this? Sexual harassment? At a time like this?
No, you idiot! Didn’t you hear what Wiz said? This isn’t sexual harassment, it’s the most efficient way to transfer mana! A place near the heart where the skin is thin, that would be the back! … Ah, wait, hey! Aqua, don’t resist! I have a grand and proper reason of saving this town! You should be thankful I didn’t put my hand in front!
Everyone, there’s no time!
Amazing, this is amazing! Aqua’s mana is super amazing! I can sense that this will be the strongest explosion spell to date!
Megumin, isn’t this enough?! I can feel a lot of my mana has been taken!
Just a bit more! A bit more! Ah, this seems bad…
Hey, what do you mean by bad?! What’ll happen if it exceeds your capacity? You won’t explode, right?!
Other things don’t matter, but I can’t lose to anyone in terms of an explosion spell! I’m ready! My finest spell of destruction!
Explosion–!
Kazuma, it feels weird for me to be the one to say this, but I must thank you for protecting this town… I’m grateful…! One day, I’ll tell you everything about myself, and the reason why I want to protect this town.
To be honest, you looked really cool back then.
Is, is that so…?
But you were also the one who contributed the least.
!
Well, Darkness just stood in front of the town the entire time–I was working hard, you know! I broke the barrier and healed Kazuma! And I shared my mana with Megumin!
As for me, I fired two Explosions in one day, a stellar performance. And the second shot obliterated the Destroyer!
Kazuma was great too! His command was on point. He also defeated a large golem despite some minor mistakes, extracted the Coronatite ore, and provided me with mana…!
Wiz was superb, casting an explosion spell, icing my hand, and even teleporting the Coronatite ore that was about to explode away… The MVP should be Wiz, right?
… So, after acting stubborn and talking about protecting the town, what did you do?
What’s this!? This new feeling…! Wahhh–!
Adventurer Satou Kazuma ! You’re under arrest for the crime of treason! Come with us!
Defendant, Satou Kazuma. In review of your repeated and inhumane actions…
And your actions that obviously disrupt the peace of the town…
The jury concludes that the argument of the prosecutor is adequate.
I find the accused guilty and hereby–
– sentence you to death.
Adventurer Satou Kazuma! You’re under suspicion of committing subversion of the nation! Please come along with us!
Eh… May I ask who you are? Or rather, what does ‘Subversion of the nation’ mean? I just came here to collect my payout.
I’m a prosecutor of the Kingdom, Sena. Subversion of the nation literally means committing an act that undermines the authority of the nation. We suspect that you’re either a terrorist or a minion of the Demon King’s army.
Ehh? Hey, Kazuma, what trouble did you stir up this time? What crimes did you commit while I wasn’t looking! Apologize right now! I’ll apologize together with you, so do it quick!
Are you an idiot! There’s no way I would commit such crimes! In the first place, we spend most of our time together! There’s no way you wouldn’t know if I did anything!
Wait a minute, did you get the wrong person? Kazuma does commit minor infractions like sexual harassment from time-to-time, but he doesn’t have the guts to commit such a major crime.
Are you helping me or looking for a fight?
Yeah, I don’t think this man would commit such a serious crime. If he had the guts, he would do more than ogle at me with creepy eyes when I walk around the house in a skimpy attire. He’s a loser who doesn’t even dare to do a night raid.
Wh-Wh-Who is looking at you!? Aren’t you too self-conscious? Don’t get conceited just because you have a sexy body. I have the right to choose, all right?
After asking me to do all that in the shower, you’re saying this now…?!
I was manipulated by a succubus that time! And you’re the one with the problem, being so docile and scrubbing my back because of the mood! And what do you want now? Are you expecting something? Just how gullible and open are you?
I-I-I know you still have memories about that…! And as a crusader serving the Goddess Eris, my body is still pure! Saying I’m gullible and open? I’ll kill you!
Teleporting the core of the Destroyer, Coronatite, was done at that man’s instruction. And the place the ore was teleported to was the mansion of the Lord.
Really, so that landlord died in the explosion…?
He’s not dead, don’t just kill him off! Coincidentally, the landlord had sent away all the household staff and was in the basement himself, so there were no casualties. But the mansion was destroyed.
So no one died in the fight against the Destroyer? That’s great.
It’s not great! Do you know the situation right now? You sent an explosive device into the mansion of the landlord and blew up the entire mansion! Like I told you, you’re under suspicion of being either a terrorist or a minion of the Demon King’s army. Anyway, I’ll listen to what you have to say back at the station.
Ku, I thought it was something terrible… Kazuma was the most valuable player during the battle against the Destroyer. He might be the one who ordered the teleportation of the Coronatite, but he had no choice in that situation. If not for Kazuma’s wits, people might’ve died when the Coronatite exploded. He should be commended, not prosecuted.
By the way, the charge of subversion could be brought against suspects other than the mastermind. Before the trial ends, I’ll advise everyone to mind your words and actions. If there are people who want to go to jail with him, I won’t mind.
… ‘Don’t worry! The world is huge! Compared to a place with lots of people, the chance of it ending up somewhere with nobody around is higher! Don’t worry, I’ll take all the responsibility! I might look this way, but my luck is incredibly good!’… I remember that was what Kazuma said during that moment…
By the way, I never made it inside the Destroyer. If I was there, I would’ve stopped Kazuma from making that decision. Unfortunately, I wasn’t there, so it can’t be helped. That’s right, how unfortunate.
… Hey, hold it. Aqua, Megumin, you two… Could it be…?
Wait a minute, I’m the mastermind, and the one giving the instructions was me. Please let me join the kinky games in prison… No–I mean if you want to arrest Kazuma, take me in and interrogate me too!
I heard that you only stood in front of the Destroyer and were totally useless, right?
?
Um… the one who cast teleportation was me. If you want to arrest Kazuma-san, then I…
Don’t do it Wiz! If sacrificing one person is enough, this should be for the best! I know you feel bad, but you need to endure this…! That’s right, Kazuma is not leaving us forever. We need to wait patiently for Kazuma to return safely from prison, understand?
Forget it; even if you aren’t with me, I can still rely on the guys in the guild!
Hey, what kind of joke is this?! Put in more effort you guys! At least resist a little!
The first time I met Kazuma-san… That’s right, I saw it that time. At the alley behind the guild, Kazuma-san stripped a female thief of her panties. Yes, his expression back then left a deep scar on me.
That’s right, I always thought Kazuma would get into big trouble one day…
Yeah, me too. I heard a rumor that he locked the priestess in his party inside a cage and used her as bait for crocodiles.
There’s more; I heard that when someone challenged him to a duel, Kazuma stole the challenger’s magic sword and sold it.
Oh, you guys are turning on me now?! I’ll remember your faces, loudmouths! Better watch your back after I prove my innocence…!
I won’t forget this–!
Okay, go in obediently. Until after the trial is over, this will be your room.
Hey, I’m the hero who saved this town, right? Are you for real? Are you really going to lock me inside a cell? Are you serious?
I’ll question you thoroughly tomorrow, just rest here for today.
Hey! Wait!… Hey!… Hey!… Really…?
I want to go back… I had enough, I want to go back to Japan…
Hey, I won’t resist, so be gentle!
Shut up, scum! Faster!
Go in! Really, how many times do you want to come here? This is a prison, not a hotel. There’s someone who went in before you, so get along.
All right, all right, I get it. Sorry for the intrusion… Hey, isn’t that Kazuma? What are you doing here?
Hey, what a coincidence to meet you here! So, what did you do?
Nothing much, they seem to think I’m a terrorist… During the battle with the Destroyer, I gave the order to teleport the core that was about to explode. Turns out, that thing was sent to the landlord’s mansion and blew his house apart.
Wahaha, that’s great, Kazuma! That stinky landlord is detestable anyway! Well done! Wahaha, he had it coming!
Hold it, it wasn’t intentional! I didn’t do it because I had something against the landlord! Or rather… I’m curious. What are you doing here, Dust?
Me? Nothing much. I heard the payout for defeating the Destroyer was coming, so I ate and drank to my content and left tabs everywhere, thinking that I would clear the debts with the payout. I thought the payout would be great, so I took out a loan to gamble. In the end, the payout was smaller than I thought and I couldn’t pay back the money. With no money, I had to sleep in the stables. But it’s cold out this season, so I’d rather come here so I won’t freeze to death and have food to eat. So, I ate at some place without paying, and the debtors couldn’t chase me here too.
… Ka… Kazuma! Hey, Kazuma, wake up!
Hey, Kazuma, can you hear me? Kazuma–
Aqua! What do you want, dammit!
I’m here to save you, of course! Megumin and Darkness are creating a diversion right now to attract the attention of the guards. Megumin probably set off her explosion magic somewhere near town, drawing the police away. Darkness should be fleeing the scene with Megumin who depleted her mana in tow.
Anyway, why are you guys thinking of saving me now? If you wanted to help, you should’ve supported me during the day.
If we did that, we would be spending our time in prison together! We didn’t do this out of fear of what Kazuma would do to us after you get out, definitely not.
But would it be fine to run away like this? Won’t it make matters worse?
What nonsense are you saying? Subversion of the nation is punishable by death. I heard from Darkness that the landlord is a despicable and petty person. For a nobody adventurer like Kazuma, he’ll use his influence to twist the facts and kill you off.
… I’ll break out of prison then, but how am I supposed to get out of here? Saw through the iron bars in the window?
First, use that wire to open the lock of your cell, just like in a manga. You can then use your Lurk skill to escape the police station! After that, return to the mansion and prepare to run away in the night! That’s it then, I’ll wait for you at the front of the police station!
… I’m going back to sleep.
Get up! Come with me. It’s time for your interrogation!
What is it, it’s still early…
It’s almost noon! How do you normally spend your time?!
All right, get in. I’ll listen to what you say, then decide if I’m going to prosecute you. You better think carefully before you speak!
Do you know what this is? This is a magic item that can detect lies, used in court and places like this. This bell is synchronized with the magic caster in this room, and will ring when lies are uttered. Please remember this… Well then, I’ll begin my questioning now.
Satou Kazuma. Age sixteen, working as an adventurer. Your job is also an adventurer… So, state your place of birth and what you were doing before you started adventuring.
I’m from Japan, and I was a student.
… Write this down, falsifying place of birth and job history…
Wait! I didn’t lie!
… I’m from Japan. I spent every day in my house, living a depraved life.
… Why did you lie about being a student?
I didn’t lie… Ugh… Forget it…
I’ve never heard of a place called Japan before… But never mind. Next, state the reason why you wanted to become an adventurer.
To save the citizens that were being terrorized by the Demon King’s army and…
… Because being an adventurer sounded cool. It felt like it would be easy to make big money and become popular with the girls.
…Ve-Very well. Next question. Do you bear any grudge against the landlord? I heard that you had been complaining about your debts.
That’s because the huge payout from successfully taking down the Dullahan wasn’t enough to pay the reparation fees for the damage done to the town; that’s why I landed in debt. It was done to protect the town, but it would be meaningless if the town got destroyed in the process. I’m fine with this outcome.
To be frank, I used words like these to convince my angry comrades. But honestly, for him to treat the heroes who saved the town like this, it makes me want to kill him.
I… I see. Then next…
Excuse me… Can I say something?
Would you like to just get straight to the point? Like ‘Are you working for the Demon King’s army?’, or ‘Did you give that order because you had a grudge against the landlord?’. I’ve said this several times: I only asked someone to perform a random teleport. I wasn’t targeting the landlord, and I never thought that things would’ve turned out this way. I gave that order because I wanted to save the town. I’m telling the truth.
… I seem to have been mistaken. I’ve heard nothing but bad rumors about you, so that’s why… I’m very sorry…
Really, believing rumors without investigating them first? Do you know how to do your job, prosecutor?
Ugh… Sorry, I apologize…
Do you know what my achievements are? I’m not just the one who contributed the most in the subjugation of Demon King’s General Beldia; I was also the one in charge of directing the fight against the Destroyer. My stellar performance broke the Mobile Fortress Destroyer no one else could defeat! And you didn’t even offer a word of thanks, just endless accusations!
I… I apologize, this is because of my job…! I know what Kazuma-san had done for the town, but…
But…? But what? Anyway, now that my suspicions have been cleared, why aren’t you serving me tea? What is it with this police station? Bringing out some Katsudon would be fine too!
Katsudon? Sorry, we don’t have that here… I’ll serve you some tea immediately…
It’s too warm! Doesn’t the prosecutor here know how to brew tea? And with your fierce attitude you probably don’t have a boyfriend, right? Since there’s a magic item here, it’s my turn to ask the questions. Do you have any man you’re close with?
No.
No. Yes, because of my personality, I never had a boyfriend even after living until this age. Are you happy now? I advise you not to go too far.
Sorry.
Anyway, what are the bad rumors you heard about me? Just those that were brought up by the adventurers yesterday?
Um, well… Apart from those, I heard you stripped the panties off a young girl in your party in public; you forced a crusader living in the same house as you to wash your back in the bath; you think your party’s priestess is troublesome and want to abandon her in a dungeon; all these rumors made you a suspicious character–
… Are they just rumors?
Just rumors.
… Those are just problems within your party, so I won’t make any comments. But do you know what people call you in the streets? Kazujerk, Kazutrash–
How… How mean! Who’s the one that gave me that sort of nickname?!
Really. To be safe, I’ll ask you again. You have no relations to anyone in the Demon King’s army, right? You’re not, for example, acquainted with a Demon King’s Army General, or anything like that…
No such thing, do you really think I’m a big sho–
Hey, there’s not enough rice! And give me something with meat on it! Who cooked this?! I want to see the manager–!
Hey Kazuma, cheer up. I can’t count the number of times I was charged in court with all my fingers. You aren’t really an adventurer until you’ve been brought to the police station once. We’ll both be attending court tomorrow, so we should eat something good and have a good rest. I’ll get you some nice food! The cops here don’t like trouble, so they’ll bring things over if you complain a bit.
Kazuma! Hey Kazuma, wake up!
You’re here again. What happened in the end last night? Is everyone fine?
Megumin and Darkness were sure they weren’t seen by anyone on the way back, but they were still made suspects for the explosion incident for some reason. The investigation capability of this world is amazing. But never mind that; I forced them both to wear a hood they hated, so they would definitely not be found out this time.
Let’s leave that for later; I was waiting for you the entire time, why didn’t you escape? I waited until my head was covered in snow; I was even questioned by the police several times, how miserable.
It’s not a lock and key padlock, but a rotating number lock. And I don’t have any lock picking skills at all, so there’s no way I can do that with just a wire.
… They got me this time, I didn’t think their prison was so secure.
It’s just a number lock. More importantly, what are you planning to do? If I don’t break out tonight, I’ll be charged in court tomorrow.
The method yesterday was too roundabout. I prepared two saws today; I’ll throw one of them to your side.
… You want me to saw through the window’s iron bars and escape?
So, you do know. We have until daybreak and there’s no time, so hurry!
… The window is too high from my side, I can’t reach it.
Don’t worry, I’m not stupid. I already knew this might happen, so I prepared a stepping stool. You can saw along with me if you use it. There’s probably not enough time for one-person to saw through it, but it should be fine with both of us working together.
So how do you plan in getting the stepping stool inside? Squeezing it through the gaps between the bars?
… Wait a minute.
No, this is… A necessity for Kazuma, I have to give it to him…
I’ve never heard of anyone sending such a thing into a jail cell. And why are you here at this late hour…?
No need to be so tense. Don’t worry, we’ll stay by your side.
No problem, leave it to me. The Crimson Demons have high intelligence; I’ll make that prosecutor cry through our debate.
Don’t worry; if events develop beyond the point of redemption, I’ll think of a way to help you. You’re not at fault for this incident at all.
Just leave it to me! As a woman of the cloth, my words are very convincing! Just leave everything to me!
Listen carefully Aqua. I’m begging you, please don’t say anything. If you keep quiet obediently for the entire trial, I’ll buy Snow Crimson Crab for you.
What nonsense are you saying? If Kazuma’s sentenced to jail or death, you won’t be able to buy crab for me. Don’t worry, the one most familiar with being an attorney is me. Kazuma likes to play video games, right? Haven’t you heard about people in Japan playing ‘Based Attorney’ and ‘Manganronpa’? I played both before.
Okay, I get it now. Please, don’t say a word.
Order in the court! We’ll now begin the trial for Satou Kazuma for subversion of the nation! The plaintiff is Alexei Barnes Alderp!
Hey, that fat old man kept looking at us. I feel the presence of evil and have the urge to poke his eyes out.
I’m pleading with you not to do that… And isn’t he only staring at Darkness?
He’s been looking at her for a very long time. His eyes are the same as Kazuma’s when he’s looking at Darkness when she walks around the mansion in flimsy attire.
Ughh… hey, you got it wrong. I-I never looked at Darkness with such eyes…
… What’s wrong Darkness? Are you bothered by that old man’s gaze?
… No… I’m fine, it’s not that… I’ll tell you later.
Silence! I’ll have order in the court. Prosecutor, step forth! We have a magic item here, so any lie will be exposed in this court. Remember this when you speak.
I’ll now read out the charges… The accused, Satou Kazuma, took part with other adventurers in the battle against the Mobile Fortress Destroyer when it attacked. He gave the order during the battle to send the Coronatite, which was going to explode, away via teleportation. The Coronatite that was teleported exploded after appearing in the mansion of the plaintiff. The mansion of the plaintiff, Alderp, disappeared. Right now, Lord Alderp is forced to live in an inn within this town.
When transporting monsters, drugs, and dangerous items such as explosives, the use of random teleportation is prohibited. It’s stated clearly in the law, and the instructions given out by the accused clearly contravene this law; also, threatening the life of the landlord could potentially shake the foundation of the nation. Hence, the prosecution requests for the accused to be found guilty of subversion of the state!
Objection!
It’s not time for the defendant to speak. Seek permission before you say anything… Well, this is your first time in court, so I’ll give you a pass this time… The defense may speak.
I just wanted to try saying ‘Objection’, it’s okay.
The defense may only speak when defending the accused!
… Eh, that’s all I have to say. In short, we’re asking for Satou Kazuma to be found guilty of subversion of the nation…
Next, I grant permission for the accused and his defense to speak. You may plead your case!
– And so, the Demon King’s General Beldia and the Destroyer were only defeated thanks to my efforts. It’s strange to accuse me of subversion of the nation with my contribution to the town. In fact, I think that everyone should be complimenting me instead!
Enough… Enough, I understand what the defendant is trying to say. Moving on, prosecutor. Please present the evidence showing why the accused should be found guilty of subversion of the nation.
The prosecution will present the evidence, proving the accused is a terrorist attempting to subvert the authority of the nation, or that he is related to the Demon King’s army. Witness, please take the stand!
Ahahaha… I was summoned…
Which means, the accused used Steal under the watchful eyes of the public to strip you of your panties. Is this true?
Um–it’s true! But it was an accident!
You just need to confirm this is true, thank you for your testimony.
Hmm? Wait! I’m not bothered by that incident anymore…!
Mitsurugi-san. I heard your magic sword was stolen and sold by the accused. And the two ladies were threatened by the accused that he would steal their panties if you tried to get the magic sword back. Is this true?
Yes, you’re right. But that incident was started by me…
That’s right, he threatened us! He said, ‘I’m a man who believes in gender equality, who dares to use drop kicks against girls’!
Yeah! He also said, ‘Since you are girls, I might humiliate you in public using my Steal skill’!
This man is the defendant of the next court case. I think the court should be familiar with him. He’s a delinquent that causes trouble and keeps getting sued.
Hey, you jerk, you’re the one who asked for me when I was just waiting for my turn in court. I just got here, so stop speaking ill about me! Are you asking me to massage those big tits of yours?
Dust-san, I heard that you’re rather close with Satou Kazuma-san here. Is this true?
How could there be any doubt. We’re like brothers, and drink together often.
Satou Kazuma-san, are you best friends with this unruly delinquent?
Just an acquaintance.
Hey–! Kazuma!
I… I see, pardon my rudeness. I wanted to bring up the point that your friends are delinquents, that’s why…
It’s fine, it’s a fact that I’m acquainted with him.
Kazuma–! Is our friendship so shallow–?!
That last witness was disappointing, but the other witnesses should suffice to prove that the accused has a flawed personality and bore a grudge against the plaintiff. Based on these facts, it’s very possible that the accused didn’t order a random teleport to be used, but instructed for a normal teleport to transfer the stone to the mansion of the plaintiff, and disguised it as an accident–
That isn’t evidence at all! I admit that Kazuma has a twisted personality, but I can’t accept such a circumstantial charge! Bring out something more concrete! And this trial is too strange! Everything is too forced; don’t you find this weird?
The defendants are to watch their words. Only speak up when granted permission!
You want evidence? Very well, I’ll bring undeniable proof! They’ll show without a doubt that this man is a terrorist determined to destroy the town, or is a minion of the Demon King’s army!
One! The party led by adventurer Satou Kazuma might’ve defeated the general of the Demon King’s army during the fight with Beldia, but extensive damage was done to the town due to the huge amount of water that was conjured–
Two! Setting up a giant barrier in the public cemetery, causing the spirits in the cemetery to wander, creating havoc in town–
Casting an explosion spell in the area outside of town day after day, changing the landscape of the territory. Recently, it could be heard in the wee hours of the night, rousing the citizens from their sleep–
Hey, wait, this is too strange! It’s weird no matter how you think about it! The things you listed out have nothing to do with me! Well, they were troubles caused by the members of my team! But you should bring out evidence that has something to do with me!
And, we have reports of the accused using a skill only available to the undead, Drain Touch. If you’re not related to the Demon King’s army, please explain why you can use Drain Touch–You can’t just ignore this by covering your ears!
Finally, the most damning evidence… During the interrogation inside the police station, I asked if you had any dealings with a member of the Demon King’s army. You answered no back then, and the magic item detected a lie. That’s the best evidence!
– Hold it!
Aqua, tell them! Show them the decisive evidence that proves my innocence!
Huh? There’s no way I have something like that, I just wanted to try saying that.
Remove that person from court!
Sorry! I apologize on behalf of this counsel!
Ahhh… that hurts!
Enough! That guy’s related to the Demon King’s army! He’s their minion! He sent explosives to my mansion! Kill him! Sentence him to death!
No, I’m not related to the Demon King’s army! I’m not a terrorist! I do bear a grudge because he made me shoulder that debt, but I didn’t send the Coronatite over on purpose! Listen carefully, look at the magic item closely! I’m going to say this again! I’m not a minion of the Demon King’s army and I have nothing to do with them!
It’s always like this when we use the magic item to detect lies, the results aren’t clear. The prosecution motioned for the reaction of the magic item to be endorsed as evidence. But from the results right now, I can’t accept it as legitimate evidence. The circumstantial evidence presented so far is too weak. And so, I hereby find the accused, Satou Kazuma, not guilty  from the lack of–
I’ll say this again. That guy’s affiliated with the Demon King’s army, he’s one of their minions. Sentence him to death.
No… No one was hurt for this incident. It should not lead to the death penalty…
… No, you’re right. The death sentence is the most appropriate… Right?
Hey, hey, wait a minute! This is too weird, too weird!
Yeah, what was with that just now! Why did the prosecutor’s argument change?!
I feel an evil presence! Someone among this group is attempting to twist the facts with evil powers!
Powers of evil… So, you are saying someone is using underhanded means to influence this sacred trial?
Yes, that’s correct. My eyes are more accurate than that magic item! Truthfully speaking, I’m a goddess of water with 10 million devotees in this world! Goddess Aqua!
Why–! Wait, I didn’t lie–!
Defendant, please choose your counsels carefully.
My apologies, I’ll reflect on this seriously.
I get it, it must be because I was acting too vainly. The magic item thought I was lying because of the number of devotees! 10 million is exaggerating a bit, I should had said something in the region of 9.8 million.
… Defendant Satou Kazuma. Considering your inhumane actions and your disruption of the peace and order to society…
I find the sentence motioned by the prosecutor to be adequate. The accused is found guilty and–
– Sentenced to death.
This is weird–! No, hold it, wait a minute! What’s with this rushed verdict?! Bring out stronger evidence! There must be something wrong with your head to sentence someone to death so lightly!
Defendant! Watch your behavior!
Kazuma’s right, this is strange. There’s something wrong. That’s right, Kazuma did bear a grudge for having to shoulder the reparation cost of the flood, likes to complain, and hates the landlord, which might lead to trouble one day. But despite all that, he doesn’t have the guts to send the Coronatite over!
Very well, since you want to think of Kazuma as a terrorist, I’ll show you what a real terrorist is like… Hey, what are you doing! Release me!
No–! This is weird! Too weird! My clear eyes can see evil lingering in the air inside this court! Just wait for a moment, I’ll purify the air right now… Ah! I’m not using any suspicious magic, don’t get in my way!
Usage of spells are strictly prohibited within the courts! It might interfere with the lie detection magic device!
Enough, get them both out of here!
Order! Order!… I said order in the court!
– Your Honor, please look at this.
Th-That’s… Y-You’re…
Pardon me, could you suspend the trial for me? I don’t mean to get the prosecutor to throw the case out. I just need time to prove that this man is not a minion of the Demon King’s army, and is innocent. At the same time, I’ll ask him to compensate the landlord for the mansion.
This… But, even if you request for this…!
Alderp. As the victim in all this, you could count this as me owing you a favor. If it’s within my means, I can do anything for you. I’m not asking you to withdraw the charges, I just hope you can wait a while longer.
Anything?! An… Anything…!
That’s right, anything.
All right; since you’re the one requesting, I’ll grant this man more time.
What was that just now? Or rather, you know that old man Alderp?
… You could say that. Ever since I was young, he had an obsession towards me. Ever since his wife passed on, he asked for my hand in marriage several times. But my father rejected him due to our age difference.
Are… Are you all right? Will it be fine to promise doing anything for that kind of old man? From the way he was checking you out, he’ll probably ask for something horrible.
… Something, something horrible…
You… Return my sympathy to me…
I understand what Kazuma’s thinking! You got into all this trouble because of that undead. You’re planning to rob her shop to pay off the debts, right?
Get out here undead monster! I’ll send you to the other world!
Wh-What? Robbers? The mafia?… Eck–! It’s… It’s Aqua-sama!
I see… First, congratulations on being released! I’m terribly sorry, Kazuma-san. It was all because I teleported that stone…
That’s right, if you understand then, ugh…!
Don’t worry about it. If Wiz wasn’t there back then, we wouldn’t have made through it unscathed. It blew the landlord’s mansion up, but no one was hurt. I just need to prove to Sena that I’m not a minion of the Demon King’s army to be cleared of any suspicion. But the next problem would be raising the funds to rebuild the landlord’s mansion.
I see, you managed to buy some time. But as for money… I really want to help you, but my shop’s losing money, so I don’t have much cash on hand… I had a friend back from my days with the Demon King’s army. He was great in making money, but was an unfathomable person; I could never understand what he was thinking… It would be great if there’s anything else I can help you with…
No, I’m here because you can help me with something.
That’s right, the thing we need your help with is for you to move on from this world!
It’s not easy to make a living with adventuring as a career. Hence, I must rely on doing business… And the only one I could rely on at such short notice is Wiz.
In other words, Kazuma’s saying that we’ll be taking over this shop, so hurry up and give us the deed… That hurts!
If it’s something like this, then there’s definitely no problem. I would very much like more variety with merchandize. My shop’s not that popular anyway… And if you’re making reparations for the landlord’s mansion, I’m related to it too… I don’t know what you plan to sell, but I’m looking forward to it, Kazuma-san.
…? What is it? If there’s something bothering you, do tell me. I don’t plan to force this upon you, so if there’s something you’re worried about…
No, I’m not worried about that! Um… It’s great for me if Kazuma-san is willing to place his merchandize in my shop. It’s unrelated to that; it’s about Aqua-sama…
…? What’s wrong with this girl? Oh… If I put my wares here, Aqua might come over from time to time and cause you trouble, huh? If you’re afraid of that girl, I’ll ask her to avoid coming here.
… No, that’s not it… It’s fine for Aqua-sama to visit… But she’ll talk to the customers when she’s here, saying that the merchandize here is made using unspeakable methods by the shop lady, and it’s better not to buy them…
Hey, what’s that all about?
It’s… It’s fine! It’s all in the past now! The amazing thing is, things like holy water inside my shop were wildly popular with the male adventurers, so it’s fine…
More importantly… Aqua-sama touches all the merchandize in my shop, causing all cursed and necromancy items to be purified, making many of the items unusable…
What were you thinking, you damn goddess!
I’m sorry Wiz! I’ll take responsibility and compensate your damaged goods with her money! You jerk, don’t resist and apologize properly!
Wait Kazuma! I don’t wanna! And the water being purified after getting in contact with me is because of my holy aura, it can’t be helped! It’s just like plants photosynthesizing when the sun shines on them, it’s automatic! I really can’t control that!
Please, please, raise your head! It’s fine, it’s all in the past now! I just hope she won’t try to purify the goods from now on. I have troubled Aqua-sama a lot too, like asking her to send the lost souls in the cemetery to the other world and exorcise that mansion…!
Hey–Kazuma–Where’s Darkness–? Isn’t she back yet?
… Ahhhhhh–!
Hya–what’s the matter? Hey, what’s wrong with you, why are you screaming while hugging your head! Kazuma, you’re already strange, but you’re acting especially weirdly today!
Meow–
… You want to keep this thing in the mansion?
… Yes. This is a good child, and would not cause trouble for anyone… Is it fine?
It should be fine, I guess? I don’t think anyone living here is allergic to cats… Oh, what’s with this guy, she’s good with people.
That hurts! Why’s this cat only clawing at me? What’s going on, be it the black fur or that arrogant attitude… I can feel an evil aura from the body of this cat!
Hey, Megumin. What’s the name of this evil beast?
Chomusuke.
… What did you say the cat’s name is again?
It’s Chomusuke.
Hey, Megumin. That’s a female cat, right? I don’t think that name suits her.
No. Its name is Chomusuke.
… Hey, Aqua, this cat can spit fire.
What kind of silly talk is that? Kazuma, are you all right?
Cats don’t spit fire. Cats are animals that purr and meow.
That’s right. And they like to eat fish and look cute too.
No, this thing just spit fire and grilled the fish before eating it.
… Kazuma, you must be tired.
You were detained in court after all, a lot of things have happened.
It’s true! I’m not crazy!
Anyway, what were you two arguing about just now? If it’s about Darkness, she’s not a kid anymore, it’s fine even if she doesn’t return for a few days. Please calm down.
… You’re too calm. Do you know what the landlord is doing to Darkness right now? It must be something terrible.
He’s a landlord after all, what could someone with such status do to Darkness… Wait, I did hear quite a bit of negative news related to this landlord, but Darkness is an adventurer. I don’t think she’ll just let him have his way with her.
This is why people call you a child! You spent so much time together with Darkness and you still don’t understand that pervert? She’ll definitely end up blushing bright red and saying, ‘Ugh! Even if you have your way with my body, you’ll never have my heart! I will not yield to you!’
!
Wh-Wh-What should we do? Darkness, Darkness is in danger! What should we do, Kazuma?
She left yesterday and it’s already been one night, so it’s too late. Listen up, when Darkness comes back, you have to treat her as gently as usual.
I-I will! Since Darkness has become an adult, we can’t ask her what happened either, right?
Ahwahah…! Darkness… Darkness, she…!
Satou Kazuma! Is Satou Kazuma here–?
Hey, hey, what are you doing here? There’s still some time before the deadline for me to prove my innocence, right? Sorry, I don’t have time for you right now, my comrade…
You say you have no time for me? Don’t bullshit me! So, you really are a minion of the Demon King’s army! You’ve got guts to cause this mess!
Wha… What do you mean by ‘this mess’…?
It’s frogs! The frogs that should be hibernating came out and are moving everywhere outside the town!
Don’t frame us for this. Or are you insinuating that we’re controlling the monsters and woke the hibernating frogs up? Show me the evidence for that!
According to the reports from the guild staff, the frogs seemed to be fearing something when they emerged from the ground… Speaking of fear, it reminded me of someone casting an explosion spell not far from town, terrorizing the citizens.
Wait, let me explain! I only did it because Aqua asked me too! I was the one who did it, but the mastermind’s Aqua!
How sly Megumin! Weren’t you excited when I came to discuss it with you? You even said, ‘Let me show you my power!’.
Now’s not the time to fight so disgracefully! Go and clean up the mess you made!
No–! I had enough–! I don’t want to be eaten by the frogs–!
But to think the frogs are still agile even when it’s this cold outside. They’re moving as fast as usual. Both animals and vegetations are strong around here.
Because of the harsh environment in this world, all living beings try their hardest every single moment. We mustn’t lose to them; we have to become stronger to survive in this dangerous world.
Hold on, I’ll save you.
No, it’s fine for you to take down the frog chasing after Aqua first. It’s cold outside, I prefer the warmth inside the frog’s mouth.
Why you… One of your comrades is being swallowed by a frog while the other is being chased around, how can you remain so calm?
Kazuma–! Hurry–! Hurry up–!
Well then, I’ll save you now Megumin.
Hey, Kazuma, were you waiting for me to be eaten just now? Hey, you were going to let the frog eat me, right?! And your arrow almost destroyed the charm point on my head!
… Do you always fight in such a dangerous manner? Are… Are these bunch of people really related to the Demon King’s army…?
Wait, there’s frogs…!
… Ah.
Aqua, we’ll split up! I’ll pull away and try to dispose of one, you continue luring them!
I don’t wanna–! I don’t want to be chased by frogs anymore–! You be the bait–!
Your attack power isn’t enough to defeat frogs, stupid! If we can take one down, there’ll just be two left! We can stop them with you and Sena!
Ehh? I-I’m just here to inspect, I shouldn’t take part in the fight…! And are you planning to use a normal person like me as bait?
Excuse me, I’m being gradually swallowed, you can save me anytime now.
Light of Saber–!
Energy Ignition!
That was Advanced Magic just now…! There’s someone who could use Advanced Magic in this town…?
I don’t know who you are, but thank you for saving us.
I-I wasn’t planning to save you. It’s just that having my rival be eaten by a mere frog would leave a bad taste in my mouth, that’s all…
What? You and Megumin know each other?
Rather than know each other, we’re more like rivals… – Long time no see, Megumin! As promised, I’ve returned after completing my training! As you can see, I can use Advanced Magic freely now! All right, it’s time to fulfill the promise I made! I’ll settle our long-time rivalry today!
…? Who are you?
Eh?
It’s… It’s me! You remember, right? We were classmates at the Crimson Demon Academy! Megumin was always the top student, while I was number 2! And I said I would go on a journey to train myself until I could use Advanced Magic…!
… Hey, I can’t ignore that. Did she just say you were the top of your school?
Why are you still saying this? I already told you that I was the best wizard of the Crimson Demons when we first met, didn’t we? Kazuma was just too dumb to realize the truth. But after knowing me for so long, it’s about time for you to believe me, right?
If someone believed what you said after seeing you covered in goo, I would want to see how that person looks like.
Why, why you!
Please, please, wait a minute!
Hey, it’s me Megumin! Did you really forget about me? Try to recall how I was always challenging you in everything at school. You always said I had to place an adequate bet, and would accept if I bet my lunch! And you conned me of my lunch every time!
Hey, I think they’ll take a long time. Can I go back to the guild first? Otherwise, the frogs’ meat will go bad. Can I go get the people from the guild to ferry the frogs back?
… Hmm. Seems like you still have much to talk about. Well then, I’ll take my leave today… Kazuma-san, your adventure today was pathetic, but I won’t throw out the possibility that this was just an act to deceive me… I can’t trust you just yet.
Why did she keep saying she knew you? She seemed to know you very well, so hurry up and remember her, all right?
I don’t know her. And she didn’t even mention her name. Isn’t that suspicious? This must be the scam Kazuma told Aqua that she mustn’t pull, that ‘it’s me it’s me’ scam. You must absolutely not trust her.
Wait, wait–! I-I know, it’s embarrassing to do this in front of others, but I’ll introduce myself!… I’m Yunyun, an Archwizard, wielder of Advanced Magic, and the one who’ll become the chief of the Crimson Demons in the future…!
That’s how it is. She’s Yunyun, the daughter of the village chief of the Crimson Demons. She claimed to be my rival during our school days and will inherit the position of village chief in the future.
Okay. I’m this girl’s adventuring comrade, Kazuma. Nice to meet you, Yunyun.
So, you do remember me!… Hmm, this is strange. Kazuma… san? Um, why didn’t you laugh after hearing my name?
Your name’s a bit strange, but that has nothing to do with your personality, right? There are people in this world with a strange name and a strong presence, but still somehow manages to get the nickname of ‘Explosion girl with a screw loose’.
Is that me? Are you talking about me? That nickname stuck on before I knew it!
… I see, as expected of Megumin, you found a good comrade. You’re my rival indeed.
Anyway, do you want to talk about this at another place? It’s inconvenient to talk while standing here.
It’s all because Megumin pretended not to know me that it became so weird…! Megumin, I’m here to settle things with you! I’m the one who will be the chief of the Crimson Demons! If I don’t defeat you, I can’t possibly take the position of the chief in the future! And most importantly…!
As promised, I learned Advanced Magic. Next, I’ll be defeating you and getting the title of strongest of the Crimson Demons. That way, no one can fault me when I take the position of chief. I won’t let anyone say I depended on my family connections! Come Megumin, let’s duel!
I don’t wanna. It’s freezing outside, and my body temperature is starting to drop.
Hmm–
It’s settled then, let’s go back. I’ll heat the water up, so go wash up first. After your bath, we’ll all have a meal together.
Wait, wait, wait! Hey, why? We haven’t seen each other in so long, so why are you treating me so coldly? Megumin, please duel with me, okay–!
… But I can’t use magic anymore today, my mana’s exhausted. And you were planning to duel with me using magic, right? Kukuku… You underestimate my strength. With just my strength alone, I vaporized eight foolish frogs in one shot. Can you do that, Yunyun?
Yeah, she did vaporize eight frogs with just one spell.
You weren’t in this town so you might not know… But did you hear about these rumors? A boss of the Demon King’s army was tricked by me and lured to this town by my constant explosion spells cast at his castle, and was defeated. The Mobile Fortress Destroyer that claimed to be invulnerable was blown up by explosion magic in this town!
Well, the boss of the Demon King’s army did come to town because Megumin cast explosion magic daily, and the one who dealt the final blow to the Destroyer was definitely Megumin.
E-E-Even so, I still want to duel! I must duel…! No matter how slim my chances are, I’ll keep challenging you!
… You’re really troublesome. How about this, since I can’t use magic anymore today, how about sparring physically? You’re an adventurer now, so competing in an academic test should be unacceptable for you, right? No weapons; we’ll battle until one of us surrenders… Is that fine with you?
… Is that really fine? That Megumin who skipped most of the physical education classes… Could it be…? You want to let me win? That Megumin who kept walking before me during lunch, and rob me of my lunch when I challenged her?
… You really are a good-for-nothing.
… That was a matter of life and death for me. Because of the circumstances in my family, her lunch was my lifeline. If I had taken the initiative and challenged her, wouldn’t that be the same as extortion?
I understand, we’ll spar then… I know what you’ll say next. ‘If you want to challenge me, you have to place an adequate bet!’ The bet this time is this manatite crystal. It’s a high quality manatite with remarkable purity, an item all mages crave for!
Very well, I’ll accept your challenge! Well then, come at me!
… Hey, Megumin. Hold on… Um, you seem a bit wet and shiny, is that…
That’s right~ It’s goo from the frogs.
Thank you for saving me just now. This slimy thing all over me are fluids secreted from the stomach of the frog… But enough about that, attack me. The moment you come near, I’ll hug you without reservation and wrestle with you.
Me-Megumin? Don’t joke like this. You’re not serious, right? This is just a strategy to diminish my will to fight and trick me to surrender, right? Right? You always did that when we were in school. I-I won’t be fooled anymore!
We’re friends, right? Real friends must go through thick and thin together.
Surrender! I surrender! I’ll give you the mana crystal, so please don’t come over!
Ah, Kazuma, take this. It should fetch a good price. Clear some of the debts with it.
Is that fine? Why not keep it? I don’t know how to use it.
A Manatite crystal is a convenient item that can take the place of mana when casting spells, but it’s just a consumable item. From the purity and size of that crystal, it’s not enough to sustain the massive mana expenditure of explosion spells. That thing is precious for normal wizards, but useless to archwizards like me who cast magic on a grand scale.
… Isn’t that a good thing? Hey, I’ll say it again, but do you have any intention of learning spells other than Explosion…
I don’t intend to.
I thought so.
… What is it? Why are you sighing… Aside from powerful magic abilities, the Crimson Demons also have high intelligence, so I can tell what Kazuma’s thinking about.
… I was thinking that compared to that girl, Megumin’s much prettier.
Thank you for your compliment! As thanks, I’ll give you a tight hug!
Stop, stahp! Don’t come near me, you still stink like a frog!
Ugh… It stinks…  I never thought a hug from a girl could feel so unpleasant.
You should be happier about it. Some people are willing to pay a lot for a girl covered in goo to hug them.
… What?
The goo’s making me uncomfortable, let me bathe first.
I’m uncomfortable too, and this is your fault. And if I don’t go in first, there’s no way to heat the water up. Our heater needs mana to work, so you can’t use it since your mana’s depleted. The mana I shared with you can only produce lukewarm water. If you understand, wait obediently in front of the fireplace for me to finish.
If I don’t wash away the goo and sit before the fireplace, my robes will stink after they dry. Haven’t you heard of ladies first? Men should take care of ladies.
I’m someone who sincerely wishes for equality for all genders. I hate people who push for chivalry when the situation benefits them, and complain about not being men when they’re at a disadvantage. And you’re not old enough to be a lady anyway.
Ah! You’re treating me like a kid! We’re just three years apart, okay! Ten years later, we’ll be 23 and 26, there’s not much of a difference…
The future’s the future, and the past the past. I’m a man who lives in the present. In my eyes, you’re a child right now, that’s it. All right then– I’ll be the first one to bathe!
You’re really stripping!
I’ll need to charge if you want to continue watching. I will not back down. Never.
… I see. I understand, Kazuma doesn’t see me as a woman right now. Then how about bathing together. Since you don’t see me as a woman, there should be no problem, right?
You’re right, there won’t be any problem if we bathe together. I’ll go on ahead.
Eh?
Ex-Excuse me, shouldn’t the next development be you saying something shyly like, ‘Id-Idiot, it would be nice if we could do that’, and then let me go first unwillingly, right?
Why do I have to follow such a cliché script? Let me tell you first, I won’t follow such cliche developments. Let me give you an example. Let’s say Megumin falls for me, and some other girl starts flirting with me and Megumin became jealous. If you use unreasonably violence on me, I won’t hesitate in fighting back. I’ll do the right thing when the time comes, you better remember that.
… I underestimated Kazuma. Don’t worry, I’ll never fall for you. And that’s not how you use the phrase ‘Do the right thing at the right time’, but never mind.
Oh? After taunting me about it, you’re not going to bathe together with me? You gutless girl. That’s why I see you as a kid.
You say I have no guts? How dare you, it’s just bathing together; you think I’m scared?! Stop covering with your towel and hurry up!
Hey, you jerk, let go, don’t pull my towel you pervert! Why are you so open about this! Did that girl Yunyun ever tell you that you’re like a boy? You are too carefree about this, watch yourself!
The water isn’t warm enough. Pump more mana in, more mana! Come here, hurry up!
Fu…
Fu… It’s nice to bathe leisurely during the day… I think I can fall asleep here…
By the way, are you going to ignore that girl Yunyun? Hasn’t it been a long time since both of you met?
We’ll meet again soon enough anyway. That girl claiming to be my rival loves to chase after me.
The name Yunyun might be a bit off, but she looks cute. For an acquaintance of yours, she seemed to have good manners and common sense.
Are you insinuating that I lack common sense? And she’s my age, why aren’t you treating her like a child?
… Hey, tell me what you’re thinking while you’re looking at my body.
… I’m thinking that the speed of growth is different for everyone… Hey, stop that, don’t chant Explosion! I know you’ve exhausted your mana, but this isn’t good for my heart!
But that means she’s just thirteen years old. My strike zone’s two years younger than me, so thirteen’s out. If she were fourteen, that would make us middle-two and high-one, which is borderline acceptable for me.
Middle-two and high-one?… I’m not sure what you mean, but I’ll be fourteen next month. You won’t treat me like a kid after that?
… Huh, are you serious? Your birthday’s next month? Eh, fourteen? You’re graduating from being a loli character?
Who’s a loli character? I don’t recall making such a character! And… what’s with you? Why are you suddenly acting strange…?
We-Well, I suddenly think this situation’s a bit embarrassing.
Hey, don’t say that, that’ll make me feel embarrassed too! What is wrong with you? Is one year that much of a difference? And can you stop shyly stealing glances at me?
… Hey, why am I bathing together with Megumin? Thinking about it, isn’t this situation bad?
Why are you saying this now? Don’t suddenly come to your senses!
Not that, I mean if someone were to see us like this, we can’t just laugh it off, right? There should be a law or rules governing this. Especially a girl that can’t read the mood will tend to…
I’m home–!
It’s all your fault Kazuma! You were the one who triggered this flag!
Now’s not the time to say this! Anyway, one of us needs to get out now!
Why are you getting out together with me? The towel’s soaked, I already saw a lot of you, and you saw a lot of me!
You’re one to talk! I’ll get out first, you stay in there! Did you lock the door? Did you lock the door into the changing room?
No, no I didn’t lock it! Aqua will certainly come here at a time like this! What should we do? Think of something quick!
Kazuma–! Megumin–? I’m home–! Will someone welcome me back?! I sold the frog and brought the money back–!
Kazuma–!… What, so you’re bathing?
Freeze–!
Kazuma–I left both of your share of the money on the table in the living room! Let’s grab a bite after you finish your bath!
Are… Are you okay, Kazuma? Did you deplete your mana? I should say that was a close one. If things were to have escalated…
… I would be labeled a lolicon. Too close… Ah, Megumin, sorry to trouble you, but can you help me wipe my body? I’m completely out of mana and can’t move. I’ll catch a cold if I lie down here.
… Hey, why will you be labeled a lolicon if you bathe with me, explain clearly. You have guts to say such things when you can’t move.
Hey, stop it asshole! Why are you grabbing my towel! You want to be labeled a pervert?! Hey…! A-Aqua–! Aqua–! There’s a loli molesting me–!
… The two of them are out early.
– Strange monsters are appearing near town, they aren’t strong, but…
Right, I heard about that too. That thing has a weird shape, and will grab onto anything that moves and detonate, right?
…? Ah! Um, hello, Kazuma-san…!
Here, you want this right?
Thank… Thank you…
Customer, you can’t do that. Can’t you read the sign? No archers and Snipe ability users allowed. You can keep the prize, but you have to pay me three times the fees.
Well then, I’m still looking for my party mates, see you.
Hmm? Ah, um…
Um… Thank you, thank you for getting Winter Shogun for me!
All right, next challenger–! Is there no one else–?
All right! I’m next!
Warrgghhh!
Damn, this still isn’t enough…
My friend here failed! The prize is now 125,000 Eris! The entrance fee is 10,000 Eris! For every challenger that loses, the prize will increase by 5,000 Eris! Is there anyone else who is confident in your arm strength? Magic is fine too! This is Adamantite, if you can break this thing, you’ll be known as a top-class adventurer! Come, isn’t there anyone else who wants to test their might?
… We meet again, Yunyun.
Ah! Thank you for your help just now Kazuma-san! Look at that! Everyone’s taking up the challenge of smashing the Adamantite!
Yunyun can use Advanced Magic, right? Want to give it a try? The owner said spells are permitted.
I can’t break Adamantite with my powers… That requires powerful Detonation magic. Leaving the destructive explosion spell aside, detonation magic should be fine. But using explosion magic is the safest bet…
Is Adamantite too difficult for the people in this town? I came here because I heard this town took down the Mobile Fortress Destroyer! Is there no one who can break this stone? Come on, come on! Is there no other challenger?
– The main character’s turn.
Hey, I’m just an innocent girl, treating me like this is too much.
Hey old man, stop doing your business here! This girl noticed you! She’s an infamous explosion maniac in town. Your business is too stimulating for her!
Ahhh! I can break it! I can definitely break that stone with my explosion spell!
Run! Hurry up, old man!
Eek–!
… Really, Aqua is more than enough trouble without you joining in. Anyway, you’re not together with her?
Nope, she wanted to go somewhere else so we split up. The payout from defeating the Destroyer gave the town an economic boost, so all sorts of people are getting drawn here. There was someone performing in the streets for money from tips, but he was driven to tears after Aqua started doing far more impressive free performances next to him.
Let’s walk together since we ran into each other. There’s someone over there who’s doing something like the guy that ran off. I want to loiter around him to scare him.
I thought you were a girl with common sense, aside from your explosion-maniac personality.
Ah…
… Want to come along with us?
I-I came to this town to defeat Megumin! I’m not here to build a friendship with her! I’m grateful for the shooting game just now, thank you very much! But… I can’t come along with you two!
Since she doesn’t want to, let’s go Kazuma.
Oh, right…
… Sigh…
… Um, why are the two of you following me?
I was thinking that I’ll be able to see your lonely and sulking face if I follow behind you who’s alone like usual
Among the Crimson Demons, Yunyun was well known for being a weirdo that was ashamed of her own name. In school, she spent most of her time eating alone. If I loitered around Yunyun who was eating alone, she would happily challenge me, worked every time…
Wait! It’s, it’s not that bad… It shouldn’t be… Right…? Fine, it’s true. I challenged you every day, but I’m not lonely at all. I have friends too.
I can’t just ignore what you just said… Yunyun, you have friends…?
Why… Why are you reacting like this? I have friends too, all right! Megumin should know too. Like Dodonko and Funifura, they say we’re friends, I even invited them to lunch before…
And so, what shall we compete in today? I can only use explosion magic, so I don’t really want to fight with spells.
… That’s right. You should learn some other spells too. You should’ve saved quite a bit of skill points by now.
I did. I used all of them for explosion power raise and speed chanting…
Idiot! Why are you so obsessed with explosion magic?
But that’s really troubling… What should we duel in…?
Anything’s fine, I’m not a kid that’s bothered by winning or losing anymore.
Not a kid anymore? I remember when we competed in our degree of growth before. Since you say you’re not a kid anymore, want to try that again?
No, I mean I’m not a kid anymore in another way. My relationship with Kazuma has progressed so far that we’ve even bathed together before.
!
Hey! Shut it, don’t tell others about that!
?!
… It’s, it’s my loss today–!
I won today too.
You, you… Is this really fine…?
Ara, you’re back. Hey, look, look. There was a guy busking in the streets, he said he didn’t need it anymore and gave it to me. He seemed to be planning to inherit the farm in his hometown. I don’t understand why, but that’s lucky!
Darkness is still not back… She should be coming back tonight, right?
Hey Aqua, don’t make me waste my breath, just give up that seat. Since Darkness isn’t back, we won’t be doing quests today either. I need to design the merchandise to be displayed in Wiz’s shop, so get out of my way.
Why are you so irritable? You’re too hysterical lately. You don’t need to act this way just because Darkness isn’t back yet. Enough about that… I heard that girl Yunyun said something to Megumin. You must pay the adequate price for everything. If you want me to give this warm place to you, you must give me something that satisfies me. Let me think, specifically speaking…
… If thou wish for the place where the goddess resides… Offer high-class wine to me. Warm light will then shine a path for the lost NEET.
Hey, fallen goddess, if you have the time to ask for wine this early in the morning, you should think of a way to make money. Really, why do I have to work so hard? I’ll work on the debts from blowing up the mansion of the landlord, and you take care of the reparations for the flood. If you feel any guilt at all, then move aside.
Hey, stop giving me weird names, okay? Useless goddess, fallen goddess or whatever. If you keep addressing me as a fallen goddess, you’ll suffer divine retribution! Like this incident with the landlord, it might be your punishment for not taking care of me, the goddess. Kazuma, if you feel bad about the way you’re treating me, then say ‘Sorry, beautiful Aqua-sama’, and offer high-class wine to me. Go buy some, quick…
Steal.
… What are you doing, you thief! What you are doing is a crime! If I send you to the station, the delayed court date will be cancelled. Hee–Kazuma’s a criminal–! Are you planning to buy wine with my money? What I meant was for you to use your own money…
Steal.
… What are you doing, I’ll feel cold. Return my sock to me, pervert. If you don’t return it to me, I’ll tell the police that a pervert was panting excitedly after stealing my sock. If you understand…
Steal.
Hey, hey, Kazuma. This kind of prank isn’t funny. I also went a bit too far, and I’ll reflect on that. How about we both apologize and make up?
Steal.
… I’ll raise a large sum of money now. Didn’t you say your hagoromo’s a holy relic? Let me borrow it, I’ll sell it for you. If you don’t want me to take it by force, go to another room and take it off yourself… But you’ll probably say no, so I’ll just strip it away right here.
What are you talking about? This hagoromo is proof of my godhood, how could you sell it? This kind of joke isn’t funny…
Steal.
Ahhh Kazuma-sama, ahhh! I was wrong, it’s my fault, don’t, stop–!
Woo…Sniff… Boohoo… Wahhh…
Damn it, why’s your luck so strong during a time like this… Or rather, what are you doing with all this junk…
Why are you so noisy this early in the morning? What’s happening?
Hick… Kazuma, he… To pay back the debts… He says he’ll sell it… and strip me forcefully…
Hey, shut it, don’t say stuff that’ll create misunderstandings! Yes, it’s my bad. I apologize, and don’t look at me like that, Megumin! I only wanted to sell her equipment away!
Bad news, this is bad! Kazuma, bad news!
… Who are you?
Huh…? Eh…! Kazuma! Now’s not the time to joke around! Can we play this game next time instead?
What, you’re Darkness? You made us worry so much, you’re finally willing to come back!
Wahhh! Darkness, Kazuma he–! Kazuma, he wants to strip me and sell my precious thing away…!
Hey! Putting it that way can easily cause misunderstandings, so shut it!
Welcome back Darkness. You don’t need to explain what happened. Here, go take a nice long bath to soothe your body and soul.
…? Bath? What are you saying Megumin? Anyway, I’m more interested in the special play Aqua mentioned…
Are you still dreaming? Stop it with the dream talk; just rest for today. It’s great that you’re back. Listen to me, go take a warm bath and cry your heart out.
What are you talking about? Why do I have to cry? And what’s with the bath… What is it, Aqua? Why are you pulling on my skirt?
… This is definitely high-quality material. This must be the bonus reward the landlord gave you.
Darkness… You worked so hard… To save me, it must’ve been hard on you…
Stupid! What exactly did you think happened? The landlord didn’t do anything weird to me, this dress is mine! Why? You think I didn’t return earlier because I was being abused by the landlord?
What else could it be? We were thinking how terribly they were treating you… But if this wasn’t given to you by the landlord, then what’s with this expensive dress? You say this belongs to you, is it for a noble lady cosplay? Are you researching a type of play?
No! This… This isn’t cosplay! Sorry for making you worry, but that landlord didn’t have the guts to request anything rude from me… Forget about that, look at this!
… What is this? Oh, a handsome guy? How unpleasant.
Ahhh! Look at what you’ve done to the marriage interview photo! If you tear it like this, how will I reject the matchmaking now!
Oh, sorry, I was careless! I don’t know why, but my hands moved unconsciously, I couldn’t control it… Wait, what matchmaking?
That’s right! That damn Alexei, using cheap tricks like this! I did promise to do anything, but my father would reject him if it was too offensive. I knew that, that’s why I promised him back then, but…
Wait, slow down and speak clearly. Who’s this handsome guy? And forcing you to marry someone you don’t like is clearly an unreasonable request, right? Also, how’s the landlord related to the handsome guy on this photo? Darkness, if you don’t want to, why not just ask your father to reject this? I’ll try to fix this photo. Aqua, could you get some rice for me?
Okay–
The one on the photo is Alexei’s son. That damn Alexei, he probably knew if he was the one to propose, he would be rejected. But the only good point my father saw in Alexei was his son. How should I put this…? The one most enthusiastic about the marriage is my father. But I don’t understand why Alexei wants his son to marry me…
While Darkness was away, we’ve been brainstorming about ways to earn more money. These are convenient tools Kazuma thought of. He’s planning on selling them in Wiz’s shop.
Oh? Well, Kazuma has high luck stats. He might be better suited as a merchant.
Speaking about my luck, I’m really doubtful about that. If my luck was so great, I would’ve been able to meet comrades that are more useful. I wouldn’t get into debts, get entangled in troubling incidents, and live a wonderful life.
I-I’m troubled by the matchmaking because I spoke up for Kazuma! No, I’m not asking you to repay me or anything! We’re comrades after all; the most important thing is to help each other! I’ve troubled you much, so it’s only natural for me to help you!
I’ll leave clearing Kazuma’s name as a suspect to them and clean the toilet! I don’t think it’s dirty, but I’m concerned with the toilet! Kitchen and baths, leave places that use water to me!
What… What should I do? I went back these few days to stop the progression of the matchmaking session… I’m here because of that… The matchmaking will be this afternoon. There’s no time left. Pardon me, but is there anyone who’s willing to return with me to convince my father?
… In short, Darkness’s father wants her to give up the dangerous job of adventurer, so he sends her to matchmaking sessions whenever he has the chance. But Darkness doesn’t plan on marrying yet and rejected all previous attempts.
… Yes, you’re right. To be frank, I’m very satisfied with my current life. If I continue my career, an evil mage or a minion of the Demon King’s army might target me. I’ll resist until the very end, but still get captured by them in a miserable state. It’ll be terrible. I’ll be tied up in locks and chains, my clothes will be all tattered…! Ugh…! Stop… Stop…!
I think you should retire and get married soon.
I see, the previous matchmaking sessions were by the request of Darkness’s father, where you can reject. But this matchmaking session was raised by the landlord, and you’ve already promised him to do him one favor. Darkness’s father is eager and the landlord’s also eager, so you can’t reject it under such circumstances. But the landlord wants you by hook or by crook, so why’s he so obsessed with Darkness? I don’t get why he wants you as a daughter-in-law either. With his status as landlord, if he really wanted to, he could force Darkness to be his concubine.
… My, my real name’s Dustiness ford Lalatina. I’m a daughter of a rather esteemed noble clan…
Ehhh!
Dustiness…! That’s not just rather esteemed, it’s a super powerful nobility clan! The top adviser in this nation, that Dustiness? In this town?
… Yes.
What! So, if I become a child of the Dustiness family, I can slack around all day and live an extravagant life?
Yes… But, our family’s not looking to adopt…
Darkness, you…! You’re always saying things like ‘Yeah’, ‘Sure’, and acting like a proper knight! But your real name is Lalatina! It’s so cute!
Don’t, don’t call me Lalatina…!
Well… This might be surprising, but Darkness is Darkness. For me, Darkness is a tough Crusader; an important comrade. That’s all.
… Yes, please take care of me from now on too…
… Hey, hey, I have something shocking to tell you, okay? Well, I’ve said this before but you didn’t believe me… Actually, I’m a goddess!
Wow, that’s great!
Why don’t you believe me–!
We have to bring this photo back and convince Darkness’s father. Here, look at this. How is it? Isn’t the repair perfect?
Sigh… I must come up with a reason and return this photo to the other party. I’ll then apologize using this excuse and try to convince my father… That’s why, I hope someone can accompany me to do this…
That’s it–!
Ahhh!
I have to meet Yunyun, so I’m going now. I have an ominous feeling about what Kazuma’s thinking about, will it be fine?… I’m leaving Darkness in your hands, all right?
Ugh… I worked so hard to repair it…
Calm… Calm down. This is for the best in the future.
… How?
That… That’s it, Kazuma! Let’s use this plan! If this works, I won’t need to go home and beat down my father every time he arranges a session.
I get it, this is a great plan! I thought you would’ve said ‘If one of the problem children marries off, I can find a new member and relax, yahoo–!’ or something like that!
No… No way! How could I bear letting such an excellent Crusader like Darkness leave?… Don’t do that, don’t look at me with such eyes, I’m half serious about this, all right…
Is this true? Are you really fine with this, Lalatina? Are you willing to seriously consider this matchmaking session?
It’s true, dear father. Lalatina wants to try it.
Hey, hey, Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, she said ‘Dear father’.
Are… Are you stupid, Lalatina’s funnier, she called herself ‘Lalatina’.
Lalatina, who are these two guests?
These two are my adventuring companions. For this matchmaking session, I wish to employ them as a temporary butler and maid to join me for the event.
Um, about that…
Pleased to meet you. I’m adventurer Satou Kazuma, I’ve been in the care of Lady Lalatina. If the matchmaking’s a success, we probably won’t be able to meet Lady Lalatina because of our difference in status. I know we’re flaunting the rules a little, but for this very last moment, we wish to stay by Lady Lalatina’s side, and see for ourselves if we can entrust our important companion to the groom.
Please wait for a moment. We’ll prepare the attire for our honored guests.
Kazuma, you really like that graffiti, huh?
Hey, how uncultured. This is what you call modern art, those who understand will know how wonderful it is. It must be a work of a master painter.
But in the eyes of me who has learned about painting, that’s just normal graffiti.
Well, being able to paint and the ability to appraise are two different matters. Look at this part. It might look like scribbling at first, but if you…
Sorry for the wait, you… Hey Kazuma, that’s a painting of my father by me when I was young. Father really likes this painting, so he hung it here to show it off to the guests. Don’t stare at it, it makes me feel embarrassed… Hey, what are you doing? Don’t pull my hair!
Kazuma-san, this is the attire for a butler. The size should be just right, please try it on.
It looks good.
Aqua, you look nice in it. Right now, you look like a top-class minion.
You too Kazuma. You look just like a try-hard apprentice butler. It feels just like you’ll be bullied by mean senpais and will end up crying by yourself in a corner.
Ara, what an interesting way of putting it. If we weren’t in the mansion of a grand noble right now, I would’ve given you a piece of my mind… Well then, are you ready, Lady Lalatina?
Don’t… Don’t call me Lady Lalatina! Just addressing me as ‘my lady’ will do if others are around!
The two of you, this way. Listen carefully! You know what to do, right? I’m counting on you!
Oh, that one looks rather…
Is this expensive? How much is this worth?
Hey… Don’t touch the things over here, that’s my father’s expensive urn…
According to my brilliant appraisal, this urn is…
Ah!
… This urn is now a piece of trash.
What… What should we do? This is my father’s precious collection, what should we do?
Calm… Calm down! Your dad isn’t here right now! There are two solutions! First is to admit it when the matchmaking people are here. That way, your father won’t become angry before the guests! Number two! Use rice or something to make emergency repairs, and place the urn in a position that will easily fall if your dad picks it up!
I… I got it, we’ll do that! As expected of Kazuma, how quick witted! Even if I admit it before the guests, he’ll still lecture me after they leave! We’ll do temporary repairs. Put it in a position that’ll fall easily and instruct the house help not to touch it, that’s the best way!
… Excuse me, honoured guest… Please don’t teach our young lady such things…
But… To think that you would agree to this matchmaking. I’m really happy… When Alexei said he had something to discuss with me, I was worried about it. He was confident you would not reject too. Leaving Alexei aside, his son is a good man. You’ll have a wonderful life with him, Lalatina.
How mean, dear father. Lalatina only said she would seriously consider the marriage, fufufu… After thinking it through, I think it’s still too early for me to marry, but it’s too late now. I agreed to the matchmaking session, but I didn’t say I wanted to marry! I’ll mess up this meeting! I’ll destroy the matchmaking meeting! Hmm… Hahaha!
Could… Could it be the reason the two of them are here is to…?
… My lady, your choice of words is too crude, please don’t speak in such a way.
Kazuma, you… You…! What is this, are you planning to betray me?
There’s no betrayal to speak of, my lady. Right now, I’m Dustiness’s butler, and my greatest wish is for my lady to achieve happiness.
You… You’re Kazuma, right? Even if this session fails… At least, don’t let Lalatina do anything disgraceful before the other party! I’ll reward you well! So… So…!
Please leave it to me, old master. I’ll aid my lady with all I can…
You’re the brat who’s meeting with me, right? I’m Dustiness ford Lalatina! You can call me Queen Dustiness…
Ara, watch out my lady! There’s a bug on the back of your head!
Hey, what are you thinking? Are you not here to help me?
Don’t call me lady when it’s just the three of us!… What’s that important thing?
You forgot the part about not tarnishing your family’s reputation. If you make too big a mess, you’ll be the one who’ll be hurt the most.
How would I be hurt? If the negative news spread, I won’t be able to marry and can continue my adventuring career without worries! The worst case would be my father disowning me, but I’m already prepared for that… After being disowned, I’ll feel uneasy about my uncertain future… Despite that, I’ll still do my best to survive and take on jobs too hard for me. In the end, my body won’t be able to take it and I’ll get captured by the minions of the Demon King’s army, and be ravaged…! … I want to live a life like that.
So, you finally admit it.
And that guy’s not my type. The guys my father wants to set me up with are all bad.
Is that guy as bad as you say? According to your father’s description, he sounds like an okay guy. But I only know what he looks like though.
That guy’s Alexei Barnes Walther. He’s talented and looks nothing like the landlord. The citizens give rave reviews about him, he’s a cheerful man.
Speaking of Walther from the Alexei family, everyone in the town of Axel has nothing but praise for him. He distributes items to help the poor. I’ve even received it a few times too.
That’s not good! My father doing that is enough! How can a noble who wants to marry me do such a thing?
Is… Is that so? Ah, could it be that he does charity on the surface, but does evil deeds in the dark? If that’s so, I’ll feel bad even if I didn’t know about this…
There’s no such thing! First, I heard that guy has excellent character. He won’t get angry with anyone, and won’t lecture his staff when they make mistakes. He’s a weird person who would think together with them as to why such mistakes occur…
And he’s very hardworking, studying every day to help the people with his knowledge. He’s smart and great in swordsmanship, the youngest knight ever in history. I’ve never heard anything negative about him, a truly perfect man. He also advises his father often, pleading him to change his harsh policies.
Hey, from what I’m hearing, isn’t he the perfect man? Which part are you unhappy about, Darkness?
Which part am I unhappy about? Everything! First, nobles should act like nobles and always wear a sinister smile! Why does he have such clear and forthcoming eyes when we met? It should be more like… Like Kazuma’s lecherous gaze when I walk around with loose clothes in the mansion. Eyes that want to rape every inch of my body!
N-no, wait, I’m not! I-I-I’m not looking at you with such eyes!
He doesn’t get mad when his staff screws up? Is he an idiot?! If a maid makes a mistake, then he should do this and that to her using that excuse, that’s the proper way for a noble! That man doesn’t know anything! His staff makes mistakes because they want to be scolded! As a noble, he should have the guts to make all of the maids pregnant!
You’re the only one that thinks that way!
Simply put, the type I like is the total opposite of that man who’ll achieve great things, even if I leave him alone! He must not be too eye catching, either too fat or too skinny. It would be best if he loves me but has a weak will, lusting after other girls if they’re a bit kind to him. Some mandatory criteria will be having a lecherous look and is horny all year round. If he looks down on the hardships of life and just wants to live his life easily like trash, that would be great. If he has debts, that’s even better! He also must drink all day and refuse to work, always grumbling that ‘This is the fault of society’. He’ll then hit me with empty beer bottles and tell me: ‘Hey Darkness, use your slutty body to earn back some cash!’… Hmm…!
… Enough! I’ll destroy this meeting myself! Kazuma, be prepared for the consequences if you get in my way!
… Kazuma, what are you planning?
You saw her dad’s face too, right? He’s really worried about his daughter’s future. You heard how the other party’s reputation was, right? This isn’t a political marriage, but a father who wishes for the happiness of his daughter; a carefully planned meeting.
What then? Even if it was Darkness’s father, he has no right to decide her life…
Darkness is a noble. Isn’t it normal for her not to be able to decide her own marriage? For aristocrats, they live a life of luxury and receive elite education… Though we can’t really tell from Darkness’s behavior. Since they depend on the taxes of the commoners for a living, it’s normal for their life to have less freedom. Living a luxurious life from birth and wanting the freedom to decide their own life, that’s just being willful… She already had it good living such a carefree life all this while. And the one she’s marrying is a perfect man. If you still want to be picky about it, it’ll incur the wrath of the people.
… But! That’s still too much!
That’s not all.
… Eh?
Aqua. Our objective’s to defeat the Demon King and return home, but what are Darkness’s wishes?
Well, um… To not marry and continue adventuring with us…
Wrong! I don’t want to listen to such pleasantries! You know the truth! Hurry! Don’t be shy, say it! Say it out loud! I want you to say it! Let me see what expression you’ll make when saying it!
To… To be kidnapped by a strong monster she couldn’t win against and let the enemy do erotic things to her!… Ka… Kazuma, that’s sexual harassment, right? Hey, is this sexual harassment?
This isn’t sexual harassment! Listen well. If you’re a moron, then that girl’s a super moron beyond redemption! Her dream’s to be kidnapped by monsters and have perverted things done to her? That idiot! Go, tell her dad about this! Do it if you can! Tell him his daughter has a grand dream, so he must forget about marrying her off and let her realize her ambition. Explain it to her dad right now!
I’m sorry! I can’t say it! Sorry!
But… But are you certain the right choice is for her to marry that person? Darkness should have her own preference for the type of men.
Are you are saying something stupid, like the other party is pitiful because he isn’t her type? Darkness said what type of men she likes, you heard it too. If Darkness found her ideal partner and he’s exactly as she described, what are you going to do about it? Listen, just force her onto that Walther character… He’s a good guy after all, so we can trouble him a little. Darkness can be rash at times, so we should let that guy tie her down and watch over her. From what I just heard, Walther is a warm and gentle person far different compared to his father. If that’s so, he might agree to Darkness going out for adventures occasionally. We can then accompany her and do quests from time to time. Her dad would be at ease and I can relax. Darkness won’t partake in quests that are too dangerous. More importantly, I can get rid of one of the three problem children.
The three problem children you just mentioned, are you referring to me?
In the end, adventuring’s not a career you can do forever! This is a job that borders on the edge of the abyss, if I can quit then I should quit! Or rather, I’m ready to quit anytime! Let’s make it clear, that girl is an idiot! I’ll support her if she wants to continue being an adventurer, but I must emphasize that she’s an idiot! Others shouldn’t interfere in her family matters, but my goal is for Darkness to marry off successfully! If that doesn’t work, I’ll aim to at least protect the reputation of the Dustiness clan so she can marry and retire at any time!
Wait Kazuma! Answer my question!
Pardon me for the long wait.
We’re back.
I know how Kazuma feels about this. I also wish for Darkness to marry someone she likes. But after hearing what you said, I think it would be terrible if that happened.
I’m glad you understand. Listen, you just act by your own judgment. Try to help from the side so Darkness can leave a great impression on the other party, okay?
… Hey, for your own good, give it up. If not, you’ll experience something so bad that you will wish you were dead.
Pardon my interruption, old master. Could we start the meeting between the young lady and master Walther? The young lady has been looking impatient for a while now.
Well then, Mr. Walther, this way please. Lalatina, come with us too. Let’s go to the meeting room.
My heels seemed to have broken… Mr. Walther, can you lend me a hand?
Young lady, allow me. No matter how much you admire Master Walther, you aren’t engaged yet, so you can’t trouble him like this. My apologies Master Walther, the young lady is happy… Ahhh, ow, ow, ow… It’s breaking… Breaking… Please don’t joke with me… Wait, stop. Please stop! I’m telling you to knock it off young lady!
What’s wrong? Are you okay?
Fufufu, it’s nothing. Let us be off, Mr. Walther.
– Well then, let me once again introduce myself properly. I’m Alexei Barnes Walther, son of the Alexei family. My job is to assist my father in managing the territory.
I’m Dustiness ford Lalatina. I don’t think I need to introduce my family. Even the son of some upstart landlord should know… Ahhh!
Are… Are you okay?
I… I’m fine… It’s just that seeing Mr. Walther’s face is making me uncomfort- Nnnhhh–!
Young lady Darkness’s tummy has been acting up since morning. Isn’t that right, Darkness?! Don’t push yourself if your stomach hurts.
Huh? No, I’m not…!
The young lady was eager to meet Mr. Walther since early morning, she was a little too excited. As you can see, the young lady is so shy that her face is all red.
Er… Well, her face is really red… It’s a little embarrassing…
… Hey young lady, I’ll step harder if you say any more nonsense.
… What, what a wonderful reward…
Mr. Walther, I heard your mansion was destroyed not long ago. Where are you living right now? How about bunking in my place? Of course, you’ll have to sleep in a different room from my daughter.
Hahaha! No, if I’m to live under the same roof with the beautiful Lady Lalatina, it would take tremendous self-restraint to stop myself…
Lady Lalatina, what are your hobbies?
I hunt Goblins when I’m free… Ugh!
… The two of you seem to be really close.
I’m very close to this butler, Kazuma. We spend every day together. Be it meals or bathing, even sleeping at night is… Is… Ugh…
The young lady loves to joke. That’s the way she is, a cute girl who gets embarrassed by the things she herself is saying. Right, young lady Lalatina? What’s the matter, young lady Lalatina? Your face is getting red, young lady Lalatina.
Ugh… You, I’ll get you for this…
… You’re close to each other… It’s making me envious.
Please don’t joke with us, Mr. Walther. This is just a mistress and her butler playing around a little…
I don’t want to beat around the bush anymore! I can’t take this!
Hey, you’re called Walther, right? Since you’re a knight, you should know how to use a sword! My job’s a Crusader, let’s go to the dojo. I’ll appraise your capability there. Come, follow me!
… Walther, take a good look at that man. As a noble, you should learn that from the lecherous eyes of Kazuma and use it every day!
We fight until one party surrenders. Just try to make me say ‘I can’t fight anymore’, or ‘Please stop hitting me’! If you can do that, I can marry you or follow you anywhere!
Um, Lady Lalatina, I’m a knight. Even if this is just training, I can’t point a sword at a lady…
What a gutless fellow. Kazuma who’s standing right there claims to be a gender equality advocate. He even announced that he would not hesitate to drop kick a woman. You should learn from him.
… I understand. To be honest, my father forced me to come, and I’m here to reject the marriage… But after seeing you, I changed my mind. You’re different from the other daughters of nobility, as expected of the only daughter of the national chief adviser. You seem to have a bold personality, but get embarrassed by your own words. That’s cute. Your way of speaking is straightforward and isn’t haughty towards the butler serving you, treating him as an equal. I’m very interested in you… Prepare yourself, Lady Lalatina!
Very good, next. Come at me!
Enough! The match is obviously over! Why aren’t you giving up?
What’s the matter? Don’t be shy, attack with everything you’ve got! Show me your determination to persevere to the end!
… I give up, Lady Lalatina. It’s my loss. Even if my skills are better than you, I’m not as strong as you mentally… I can’t attack you anymore. You’re a strong person.
… That’s it? Boring. Come back after you train more.
… I’ve really fallen for you…
Come, Kazuma. Show Walther your merciless and despicable side. Let him learn.
…  I too wish to see how does one trusted so much by Lady Lalatina fights.
Sigh… never mind, I get it. The matchmaking’s a failure anyway, and you probably won’t spread disparaging rumors about the young lady.
Great, that’s the spirit Kazuma! I had always wanted to spar with you! A despicable man who dares to steal the underwear of a girl you just met! Unscrupulous, using all sort of dirty tricks! Come at me, and don’t hold anything back!
Create water!
Eh?
?… What’s wrong?
… It’s… It’s nothing, just that a match with wooden swords usually would not allow magic…
… How strong–as expected of Kazuma-san, who’s the best in sexual harassment. He’s good–
Fu… Fufufu… Observe, Walther! In a spar with wooden swords, he’ll suddenly humiliate me with such tricks. Witness how this man really is!
I… I didn’t mean to do that…! Ah–I don’t care anymore!
Freeze!
Ughh…!
De-Demon…! Deep in the winter, you not only soak her with water but you freeze her with magic too…?!
That’s normal–The people in town call him Scumzuma or Trashzuma for a reason.
Fu… Fuhahaha! This merciless style! This… This is…!
What’s the matter Kazuma? Your breathing is getting ragged!
Darkness, that’s it! The skinny Kazuma doesn’t have any stamina. He isn’t suited for a dragged-out battle!
Fufufu… Your movements are getting dull! Well then, it’s about time to decide this.
All right Darkness! Grab him, strangle him! The weak Kazuma will never beat you in a wrestling match!
You think you can win me in strength? You’re underestimating me!
I don’t know what you’re planning, but the difference in strength between a Crusader like me and an adventurer like you is… Ahhh!
What’s the matter? Aren’t you confident? Hey Darkness, say something! Wahaha… There’s no way I’ll fight you head on; you don’t understand that after partying with me for… Ahhh!
Fu… Fufufu… This… This is Drain Touch, right…? But before you drain me of my strength, I’ll break your hands first!
Kukuku… You can try if you can… Ahhh! It hurts!!!
Ugh, hey Darkness! Let’s make a bet! You wanted to fight me because I did a lot of things that pissed you off, right? So, let’s make a deal. The winner can ask the loser to do anything…
You… You want to make a bet…? Fu, fufufu, stalling for time…? You’re on! If I win, you’ll have to prostrate…!
Deal…! No… No take backs…!
Yeah, of course…! You’re done! Surrender! Or your hand will really…!
I’m serious! Don’t regret this! Promise! After I win, I won’t back down even if you come crying to me!
…? What… What are you planning to do if I lose?
I’ll make you go red from ear to ear, something that’ll make you cry and beg…! Hehe, it’s a bet! Let’s decide the match! I can already see you begging for forgiveness after my victory…! You just wait for your fate of screaming for my mercy!
Ugh…! What… What are you scheming…? Tell me! Hurry!
Fuhehe, it’s something you can’t even imagine, something even more overboard…!
Wha…! Stop…! Ugh…! Even… Even if I resist, my strength’s being sapped…! Why’s this happening, if this goes on…!
Hah… Hah…! You, what do you want to do to me…! Hah, hah…! Ahhh… I’ll lose if this goes on…!
I’ll keep sucking your stamina until you faint! Look forward to your miserable sight when you wake up!
Ahhh! You…! Ugh… I might lose this fight, but no matter what humiliation I suffer, my heart will not give in…! And… What’s that terrible thing you’re planning…?
Bringing up a bet on the verge of victory, how merciless…! The name Trashzuma is really adequate…!
That’s… That’s rude!
I heard you were in the Dojo, so I brought some beverages…
… They did this.
All right, drag them out and execute them.
No, this is a misunderstanding!
My girl isn’t good with people… Even with ones who are close with her. Kazuma, you’re in the same party with my daughter, right? She refrains from talking about herself, right?
Even as a Crusader, my girl was always alone… She went to the church of Eris every day, praying to Goddess Eris, wishing for comrades she could adventure with. One day, my girl came back from the church and told me she met her first comrade and made a friend. She was so happy as she told me about her female thief friend…
As for our family, my wife passed away when Darkness was young… I didn’t remarry after that, raising her as a single father. I was always doting on her and always bore her freedom in mind… I probably spoiled her that way…
I think Lalatina’s a charming girl and at the same time is as capable as any man. If not for Kazuma, I would definitely want to take her as my wife.
… I’m sorry, I don’t really get what you’re saying.
It’s fine, you can make Lady Lalatina happier than I can. I can see how deep your trust for each other is. Your feelings for each other must be the real thing, right?
All right, get your ass over here. I don’t care if you’re the landlord’s son, I need to give you a good beating.
Stop, Kazuma-san! Or do it somewhere I can’t see! Or I’ll get arrested too!
Kekeke, hahaha!
Yes… I understand! Mr. Walther, if no one wants to marry my girl, will you please take good care of her then?
Well… I’m fine with this, but…
Also, Kazuma.
Eh? Me? Yes, anything I can do for you?
Please take good care of my girl. Please watch over her, and don’t let her do anything foolish. I’m counting on you.
… Hmm? Ugh…? Meeting room?… Ahhh… Right…
… Ugh, is it over already? After losing consciousness, what filthy things have been done to me…?
Nothing, I didn’t do anything! Don’t say things that’ll cause misunderstandings, all right? It was already tense enough when you were sleeping!
Dear father, Mr. Walther. Please pretend this meeting never happened. I’ve been keeping this from you… I’m already pregnant with Kazuma’s child…
What are you saying about a virgin like me? Ahhh!! I didn’t do anything, and you have my child? Do you think you’re Mary? You’re a virgin too! Watch out or I’ll punch you in the belly!
I see, since you’re bearing Kazuma’s child, I have no choice but to give up.
I’ll tell my father that I rejected this marriage proposal. That should be for the best.
Grandson… First grandson… My… My cute grandson…!
Ahwahwah… So Kazuma and Darkness reached that stage before I realized it…! I-I need to tell everyone…! I need to tell everyone in town…!
Really, I would’ve rejected this matchmaking session if I knew that would happen.
That’s what I wanted to say. I’m grateful to you for protecting me from that landlord’s defamation, but please stop sacrificing yourself from now on. We were so worried while you were away.
What are you saying, Kazuma? You were planning to push Darkness to that Walther guy, and now you’re pretending nothing happened and painting a picture of a happy ending? Your character is too rotten!
That’s right, you dare say you were worried about me? You were planning to leave me behind in the confusion…! Aqua too, you seemed eager in marrying me off, right?
A-Aqua-san, why are you standing so close to me?
… I’m just thinking, what kind of request will Kazuma make? Are you going to ask Darkness to do something terrible? Hey, I know you were frustrated because Darkness made us so worried, but don’t go overboard, all right?
A-about that, let’s discuss this after we return to the mansion…
Boo…!Sniff…! That’s too mean–! Megumin’s a meanie–!
It’s about time you stop crying! Kazuma and the others should be back soon, they’ll think I’m at fault if they see this… Ah!
Don’t pretend you didn’t see anything, I can explain this!
No, it’s fine. I already know you like to bully others.
That’s wrong! To be honest, when Yunyun and I were classmates…! No, that’s not important right now! It’s not the time to be so worked up over Yunyun…!
Not important! You, you say I’m not important…! No need to get worked up over me…! Wah, wahhh–!
Ahhh! Enough, you’re troublesome…! Excuse us for a moment, the two of us need to talk!
I-I’m sorry for disturbing everyone…
Kazuma, bad news! This is bad news!
I know. From what I just saw, there’s plenty of bad news.
That’s not it! Never mind Yunyun for now! That was just a squabble between us, don’t mind it! I’ll explain it to you when we’re free!
It really isn’t the time to be talking about this! The situation is bad, it’s that prosecutor! That one called Sena is on her way here! She declared that she’ll definitely arrest Kazuma this time!
Satou Kazuma! Is Satou Kazuma here–?!
Again? What is it this time? Is it frogs? Or did something else happen?!
It’s the dungeon! What did you do to the dungeon? The Keele dungeon near the town! I heard that many mysterious monsters have flooded out from there!
No… Wait, that has nothing to do with us! We did enter the dungeon before, but pushing all the blame on me when things go wrong is too much!
That might be so, but I heard that you were the last batch of people to enter that dungeon. Going by your history, the chances that you people aren’t involved is really…
What twisted reasoning is this? And we really have no clue this time. Right? There’s no problem this time, right?
But this is troubling… I have no idea who else but you guys would cause such trouble. I have to hire people to investigate then…
Oh, Ms. Prosecutor, could you be asking your original suspect to help in your investigation? We have plenty on our plate trying to prove our innocence in the first place.
… I don’t have the time for this, sorry but I have to reject you.
You’re right, I can’t force this on you since you’re not related to this. But if you change your mind, please lend me a hand. I’ll be making a trip to the adventurer’s guild.
Well, I’m curious about the mysterious monsters flooding out from the dungeon… But we have things we need to do. First is clearing Kazuma’s suspicion, next is compensating the landlord for his mansion. In the end, there are no solutions for these two problems yet.
… Hey, Darkness, can we discuss…
Forget about borrowing money, I’ve already helped you plenty. Or rather, I want to see the Kazuma who’s at his wit’s end.
To be safe, I’ll ask you all again. You really have no idea what this incident is all about, right?
For me, if this has nothing to do with explosion magic, I’m not interested.
Same for me. I should say that unlike these two, I don’t cause trouble.
Ah…! It’s true that Darkness doesn’t cause any major trouble, but on the other hand you lack any stellar performance like in that battle with Destroyer!
Wha…! Me-Megumin, you…
What about you? Any ideas?
Of course not. Really, you suspect me too much.
That’s right. Even you won’t stir up trouble all day! Sorry, my bad. It’s all because of that trial, which made me so suspicious…
Really, you should trust me a little. You should say that thanks to me, monsters won’t be approaching that dungeon. Wasn’t there a room where the lich was staying? I put some major effort into drawing that magic circle that purified the lich. And that magic circle’s still there right now, keeping evil beings out of that room!
Hey, what did you say just now?
…? Why… Why are you grabbing me? Like I said, that was a magic circle I put my all into. It should still be working now keeping the monsters at bay…
You idiot–!
…Sniff… This isn’t my fault… It’s definitely not…!
Why do you do this every time; stirring trouble after accomplishing some good? Why? Is it an illness that compels you to cancel out your performance with mistakes?
Wait! This isn’t my fault this time! Please believe me, all right? I only set up a purification magic circle in the boss’s lair, it won’t cause the mass spawning of monsters! This is different from the wandering spirits incident earlier!
Hey, stop that, it’s hard to walk like this! And whether you’re the cause of this isn’t important! Sena finding your magic circle during her investigation is the real problem!
… I see, it really is a mysterious monster.
What is that? I’ve never seen or heard of something like this before.
At a glance, they don’t seem that strong in a fight.
How should I put this? I feel a strong aversion to this doll on the bi Why is that? Just seeing that thing makes me angry.
Satou-san…! What are you doing here? Did you change your mind and came here to investigate?
Now that I think about it, the appearance of the mysterious monsters will affect us too. And protecting the town from these monsters is the obligation of an adventurer.
I’ve never wished that I had a lie detection device with me so strongly before… But I’m deeply grateful for your assistance.
If that’s the case, please take this, Satou-san. It’s unknown why the monsters are spawning, but they were probably summoned by someone. If that assumption is true, then please take down the summoner and paste this on the magic circle.
… What is this?
A talisman imbued with powerful sealing magic. By pasting this on, it’ll disable the magic circle, no matter how powerful it may be. There are certain circles that will continue to summon monsters even after its caster has fallen, so please take this with you.
No, I don’t need that. Don’t worry, I have a good idea. With so many monsters in the dungeons, there’s no need to trouble ourselves by going in… Megumin! Are you ready?
I’m already ready, leave it to me.
What… What is this? What are you thinking? Could it be…!
Oh, you figured it out? That’s right, by casting Explosion at the entrance of the dungeon and sealing it…
No, don’t! Please find out the reason! No matter how you look at it, these monsters didn’t spawn naturally. The one lurking in the dungeon must be dangerous if it can summon so many monsters. Even after sealing the dungeon, the other party will escape if it can teleport. So, the goal is for you to find the enemy that’s causing this major crisis and defeat it.
Eh, wait! What…? What is this?… Oh?
What, does it want to cuddle? The mask makes me mad, but I think it looks cute when it cuddles like this… Hey, hey, Kazuma, I think this doll’s getting warmer. I have an ominous feeling!
… As you can see, this mysterious monster sticks to people who are moving and explodes. The adventurer’s guild wasn’t sure what to do about this too.
I see, this is troubling indeed.
Why are you all so calm?! Can’t you worry about me a little?! At least check to see how I’m doing!
But this is troubling… This monster can only attack by exploding, and will detonate if we hurt it a little. Even if we don’t harm it, it’ll stick to us when we don’t pay attention and will explode anyway. From the current situation, we can only stay far away and defeat them one at a time.
Hmm? What are you doing suddenly?!
… Hmm, I can take it. No problem.
I’ll clear a path, just follow behind me Kazuma.
Kazuma, Kazuma, I’ll only get in the way inside, can I standby out here? I’ll be ready to use magic at the entrance of the dungeon. Just run out if you run into a powerful monster.
If that’s the case, I’ll wait for you guys together with Megumin. I’ll cast buffing spells on you before you go in, so both of you be careful.
Hey, wait a minute! You’re coming too! You’re different from Megumin and can be of use in the dungeon!
I don’t wanna–! I don’t want to go into the dungeon anymore! I’ll be left behind if I go into the dungeon! That’s right, and many undead will chase after me–!
The only ones entering the dungeon from my party will be just Darkness and me.
Yeah… To be alone in the dark dungeon with Kazuma. I think Kazuma’s more dangerous than the monsters.
Be careful, I might just leave you in the depths of the dungeon and give you the same trauma as Aqua.
Fufufu, hahaha! Kazuma, look! I hit it, I hit it! Even I can hit these fellows accurately!
Hey–Wait, wait for us! Slow down…!
Wait…! Ahhh, it’s sticking on me! Hey, someone pull it off me!
Wahhh, don’t come here! Don’t come–!
Keep it up Darkness! Go straight down the passage! Keep charging ahead!
Okay, leave it to me! Ah, such a thrilling experience! I think this is the first time I’m fulfilling my role as a crusader!
… What’s with this? No matter how I look at it, this must be the boss of these monsters.
Hey… What are you doing here? If you’re making those dolls, that means you’re the mastermind behind this commotion, right?
Ohhh… I didn’t expect anyone to be able to reach here. Adventurers, welcome to my dungeon! Thou art correct, moi art the source and the origin of all evil! Moi art a general of the Demon King’s army, the duke of hell that commands the devils! The arch devil that can see through anything in the world, Vanir!
Darkness. Hey Darkness, we can’t handle this situation by ourselves, let’s think of a way to escape!
What are you saying? As a devotee of the Goddess Eris, how can I retreat in the face of the devil and a general of the Demon King’s army on top of that! Even if it’ll kill me, I’ll bring him down!
Ohhh, thou wish to defeat moi? Defeat Mr. Vanir, who some say is stronger than the Demon King? You… The girl who’s worried that the man over there saw your six-pack when thou were naked in the shower, I can’t fathom why art thou are so angry, but moi heard that eating some small bones will help in alleviating your nature of being quick to anger. Part of my mask was made from the bones of magic dragons, I don’t mind letting you bite it.
Six-pack… Six-pack…? You, stop spouting nonsense you minion of the Demon King! Kazuma, this guy’s lying! I don’t have any six-packs, I’m not worried about it!
Eh, don’t get agitated Darkness. Calm down!
First, although I’m a general of the Demon King’s army, I’m just maintaining the barrier of the castle because of his request, so I’m just a general in name. I’m known to others as a devil. The best delicacy for devils are the negative feelings produced by the hatred of humans. In my eyes, humans are the producer of delicacies, so I won’t perform stupid things such as killing or harming thou. Whenever a human’s born, I’m so happy that I’ll dance in the courtyard.
I-I see… But to stimulate our negative feelings, that means you’ll harm us, correct? There won’t be any negative feelings if our lives are peaceful.
For negative feelings, there are tons of them in various intensity. The tastes of every devil are different and have differing preferences. Some devils like fear and despair, while others are like me, transforming into a great beauty to approach men. And after working hard to make them fall for me, I’ll then reveal my true form and say, ‘Too bad, it’s actually moi’. Then I’ll taste their feelings as they cry tears of blood.
I’m starting to think it would be better to kill you off.
As I was toying with the Demon King’s subordinates and feeding off their negative feelings… He pleaded with me, ‘Don’t sloth in my castle and bully my subordinates. Go work occasionally…’ I was thinking about visiting my old friend residing in this town, so I took the job. On my way here, I found this dungeon without a master. I thought that it suited moi and came in on my own.
You mentioned that it would be troubling for you if humans were harmed, so what’s with these dolls? They kept spilling out from the dungeon and gave plenty of trouble to the townsfolk.
… Hmm? These things are used by moi to exterminate the useless monsters inside this dungeon. I see, since they’ve made their way out, it means that there are no more monsters inside the dungeon. It’s time for moi to stop the mass production of Vanir dolls and begin the next phase.
… The next phase? What are you scheming?
It’s rude to call it scheming, man who was as worried as a bear and pacing around the room all day because the armor girl didn’t return home for a few days. I have a grand dream as a devil. I came to this place to fulfill that dream.
Hey, shut up! You did say that you’re a devil that can see through all things, but why are you describing it as if you’d seen it with your own eyes… And you, you… Stop squirming about!
The dreams of a devil don’t sound like a good thing. Anyway, can I ask what kind of dream is that?
For moi who had existed for near eternity… I’ve been harboring the urge to go out with a bang for quite some time now–and that’s to pass on elegantly after dining on the finest negative emotions. I’ve been thinking for a long time, that I don’t even remember when I first had this thought. I had been thinking, what do I need to do to dine on the negative emotion I’m most fond of. And I’ve finally found the best idea…
First, I’ll obtain a dungeon. Next, I’ll dispatch my evil minions to standby in each room, setting grueling traps in them! Powerful veteran adventurers will then come forth to challenge themselves! After experiencing numerous challenges, someone will finally make it to my residence in the depths of the dungeon!
And waiting in the depths of the dungeon will of course, be moi! I’ll then say, ‘It was impressive for you to make your way here, adventurers! Come, great fortune awaits if you can defeat moi…!’ After my opening speech comes the final battle! After a fierce fight, the adventurers will finally defeat moi. In the end, a treasure chest with heavy seals will appear behind my tattered body. As I start to lose consciousness, the adventurers who overcame immense hardships will open the treasure chest before my eyes…!
… Inside the box will be a piece of paper saying, ‘Thank you for your patronage!’ The adventurers will then look at this paper with a blank face. That’s the scene I want to see as I head towards my demise.
Don’t do that. That’s so pitiful, anything but that…
Hey, Kazuma, I think we should take out this fellow after all.
A friend of mine’s operating a shop here. Moi original plan was to work in her shop to save up money, and use those funds along with the help of my friend to create a large dungeon. But when I passed by this dungeon, I realized there was no owner. So, I changed my mind and decided to use this place instead.
Staying here for such a reason is a bit… Anyway, I know what you’re planning to do here. Since you won’t be creating anymore dolls, there’s nothing more to discuss. We’re here because we need to do something in the room behind you. To tell you the truth, we’re here to dispel the magic circle in that room.
Huh…? Hey, Kazuma, instead of that magic circle, we should take care of this guy! You want to ignore this General of the Demon King’s army? The enemy of humanity’s right before us!
… Magic circle? Oh, that magic circle that gave moi quite a bit of trouble. Thou art too kind. I don’t know which annoying fellow did this, but this irritating magic circle’s keeping me out of the room. If thou are willing to dispel it for me, I’ll gift you a Vanir doll made by moi which will laugh in the middle of the night.
No… No thanks. It would be troubling for us if this magic circle remains here. We’ll be leaving after dispelling it, so please do as you please after that.
Why would the existence of this magic circle be bad for thee? Let moi peer into thou’s past…
… Fuhahaha!
Fuhahaha… Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! Should I say this is as expected or unexpected?! So, the magic circle that’s troubling was set by thou’s party mate! Even an arch devil like moi couldn’t breach it. To be able to set up such a magic circle, could that priestess be…?
Oh, the vision’s clear to moi! On the surface! At the entrance of this dungeon! I see the priestess who set up the magic circle drinking tea leisurely while looking bored.
All right. Girl who’s really concerned with the ‘overboard demand’ after losing a bet to this man, can’t get it off her mind, is full of anticipation and keeps squirming around. Boy who’s thinking about what to do to this girl and is itching to do so, open a path for moi! Don’t worry, ‘not killing humans’ is moi iron rule. That’s right, I won’t kill humans… All ‘humans’! That girl who gave moi so much trouble with her magic circle, I’ll show her!
Nothing’s on my mind. I’m not anticipating and I’m not squirming, so stop your nonsense! Don’t… Don’t mess around!
If you’re planning to harm Aqua, there’s no way I’ll back down. As a crusader serving the Goddess Eris, I swear on my honor that you shall not pass!
Not just your six-packs, even your brain’s hard and inflexible, girl. If I’m serious, it’ll be easy for me to finish you off. But I’m not planning to kill humans. It’s hard to judge which person will produce an exquisite negative emotion after all. Go home and finish that ‘overboard demand’ with each other. This devil with foresight eyes guarantees thou that if you return now, no one will get in your way, things will definitely develop as you hope for.
Ignore him Darkness! These are the so-called whispers of the devil! Don’t get tempted by his alluring words.
I-I won’t be tempted! Kazuma, think of the time and place, okay?!
Fuhahaha! Both are interested in the other party as a member of the opposite gender, but are too scared to cross that line because thou art party mates! Scurry off! Or thou could rest in that room with a magic circle after I pass through before returning!
Hey, Kazuma! What are you so hung up about? We live in the same mansion, it would be awkward if we develop such a relationship! Get your act together!
Ahhh! That’s right, this is Darkness. I must get my act together! It’s just that her looks and body suits my taste, but it’s that Darkness inside. Don’t be tricked by a moment of lust!
You… You… You will get it after we go back…!
Ohhh… You resisted my temptation. But how should I go about this? All my skills are so powerful, they’ll kill you in a single hit. For example, moi lethal laser. Because it’s a lethal laser, thou who art a human will perish with one hit; thou shall perish even if it doesn’t hit. Aside from this, there’s the Vanir eye beams, but it has the side effect of burning moi eyes after using it, so I haven’t tried it before…
Enough, enough! I’ll go crazy if you go on! I won’t let you go to Aqua, you’ll have to defeat me first if you want to go there!
Fuhahaha! Why are the attacks of this fierce girl not landing at all?… Hmm? Where’s the other one? That boy who’s good at talking but mediocre in performance, where did he go?
Stop looking around! Your opponent is me!
Where did the man who looked like a schemer went off to? How should I put this, such unscrupulous jerks are more dangerous than a muscle-headed crusader? I can feel his presence, but where did he…?
Don’t look down on me, face me–!
Ugh! Unscrupulous jerk, when art thou sneaked here… Oh, oh no…!
To think that… Curses, moi is too careless…! To think a talent like you was hiding in a beginner town…! Ugh… Is this how it’ll end for moi…?
No way… Did I just defeat a general of the Demon King’s army…?
… If you say something like ‘Did I just defeat?’’, it most probably means you didn’t. But that guy seemed surprised when he was slashed, so it should be for real, I guess?
As thou art hoping it to be true…
Did thou really think you had defeated moi? Sorry, not at all! Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! Oh my, the negative emotions coming from thou are delicious!
What kind of absurd body is that? You think you can do such cheat-like things because you’re a general of the Demon King’s army?!
Boohoo… I thought I really got him… I thought the me that couldn’t normally hit the enemy had taken out a general of the Demon King’s army… I didn’t do much during the fight against the Destroyer and I thought I finally had the chance to perform…
Fuhahaha! This body’s just a fake created by moi magic, the mask is my real body. No matter how much thou slash at me, this body will at most return to dust! In the end, the place where moi body dissipates will be fertile as the earth, from my body is full of mana. The flowers will bloom and the butterflies…
I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about! My headache worsens whenever you speak! Damn it! What now, Darkness? Should we withdraw for now?
I don’t wanna! Being made a fool is a shame of the knights! I must make this fellow pay…!
Yes, I understand. But I have no desire to play with thou like this. It’s time for moi to use my skill for this type of situation! I have a hidden skill that won’t harm anyone and will only absorb negative emotions, observe!
Hey Darkness! This looks bad! Let’s get out of here first!
Too late! Crusader with a tenacious body, lend thou body to moi!
… Darkness? Hey… Darkness! Say something!
Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! Listen up kid! This special power of moi, (what should I do Kazuma, my body’s been taken over!) How about it boy, if thou dare attack this girl, (I don’t mind! Don’t hold back, attack as you wish! Quickly come! This is the most wonderful situation!)
… What are you trying to say?
How can this be, what’s with this (beautiful) woman?!… Damn, damn it, don’t sneak in words and play around! But seriously, this girl’s mental tenacity is too strong… (An excellent role model of a crusader!) … Shut up!
To resist moi control, thou art a formidable opponent! (No, not really…) But if you keep on resisting my control, thou shall suffer horrible pains! (What, what did you say?!) Fuhahaha! Let’s see how long you can resist!… Huh? There aren’t negative emotions, what’s welling out from her is… Pleasure…?
(I…! I won’t give in to this pain…!) Thou have respectable courage! But enduring it any longer will cause thee to break down mentally…! … Could it be, thou are enjoying this?
All right Darkness, mission accomplished! We just need to return to the surface and that’s it! Let’s link up with Aqua and run away!
Don’t come any closer, brat! (Kazuma, don’t worry about me! Just leave me here and go!) Don’t think things will proceed as you’ve wished… (… Ahhh! I always wanted to say that line…!) Thou have feelings for this girl and don’t want to see her get hurt, right? (!) If this girl continues to resist moi power (Ka-Kazuma, this devil who claims to have foresight just said something intriguing.) If you don’t want that to happen, thou should stop this girl. (I’m happy that you feel this way about me. I really am, but the difference in our status is too vast, and we’re in the same party…) Annoying, ahhh!
You two are the annoying ones! Please, one at a time, all right? I don’t get what you’re trying to say!
Ugh…! Choosing this body was a big failure (Hey, don’t say my body’s a failure, how rude!) Silence! Moi will be leaving, thou shut your mouth!
What are you doing, brat…? What’s happening? I can’t touch… Hey… What’s this talisman, brat? My fingers get deflected even if I want to touch it! (Yeah, something’s fluttering before my eyes, how irritating… Wait. Hey Kazuma, isn’t that…!)
It’s the talisman Sena gave me. Darkness, maintain this and return to the surface with me. Keep Vanir within your body and bring him to Aqua and the others. We’ll then ask Aqua to cleanse that thing within you!
(Hya?)
Brat! This girl’s suffering tremendous pain as she resists moi control! If this goes on, she’ll suffer mental trauma! It’s in your best interest to tear off the talisman and let moi go! Or else… (It’s true Kazuma! I’ve been feeling something terrible… Very terrible…! Ahhh, this is the first time I felt something so intense, as expected of a general of the Demon King’s army! I can’t take it anymore…!)
Just hang on a little while longer, Darkness! We’re almost there! I’ll release you from the pain when we reach the surface!
Ugh… What’s with this weird situation… (It’s fine, just leave me.)
What did you say?
Darkness, great work for enduring this long! Leave the rest to Aqua, the other adventurers and I will restrain your body…
… Fuhahaha… Fuhahaha! Art thou speaking to moi?
Taking over complete! Brat, you underestimated moi! I was holding back earlier! If I approach thou’s companion with such an appearance, she’ll welcome moi with her guard down! When I see thou’s priestess companion, I’ll cleave her right in the head!
Wake up, Darkness! You’re better than this, do you want to give in to the minions of the devil?!
Fuhahaha! It’s useless, brat! I don’t know what this girl’s thinking, but when the pain exceeds a certain threshold (I-I can’t anymore…) will hand over the body… Damn, damn it! Don’t make such weird noises!
All right, time for a touching reunion for comrades who made it out of the dungeon alive! My hated enemy! I want to see what thou will do to a comrade whose body has been taken over by the enemy…!
Sacred Exorcism–!
(Ahhh–!)
Dark… Darkness–!
Fu… Fufufu… Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha!
Hey Aqua! Don’t attack Darkness with magic so suddenly, it’s bad for my heart!
What are you saying, that spell’s harmless against humans! I felt something evil coming out, so I was thinking I should cast the spell first and…
(I-I see… That’s fine, I was just surprised… Please give me a heads up next time, all right…?)
Hey Aqua! A general of the Demon King’s army is trying to take over Darkness’s body! The enemy appears to be a devil! An opponent you’re great at dealing with!
A… A general of the Demon King’s army?!
Smelly! This is too smelly! That’s right, this is the stench of a devil! Really, how did Darkness get stained with this filth?
(Hmm?! I-I don’t think I’m smelly…)
Fufufu… (Kazuma, smell me… It isn’t smelly, right?) Fuhahaha, fuhahaha! (Even if there’s a stench, it must be due to me charging around the dungeon just now.) Shut up! This is the scene where moi makes a cool speech, so keep quiet!
Fuhahaha! Greetings, cursed priestess that shares the same name as that notorious goddess of water! I’m Vanir! Duke of hell, one of the generals of the Demon King’s army, arch devil Vanir!
Not bad, greeting me with exorcism magic without hesitation! Fuhahaha, that’s the reason why the infamous Axis devotees are shunned by all! Does thou not know basic courtesy?
Annoying–being courteous to the devil, what nonsense are you saying? Devils are worse than the undead who go against the will of the gods. A parasite that can’t survive without the negative emotion of humans–! Puhehe!
Sacred High Exorcism–!
Naive!
Why are you dodging, Darkness? Be a good girl and keep still!
(I-I know, but my body’s moving by itself!)
Kazuma, Kazuma! What’s with this situation? Why’s Darkness wearing that mask…? How sly, I want a mask like that too! That mask’s stimulating my blood of the Crimson Demons!
What stupid things are you talking about, now’s not the time for that! Darkness’s body has been taken over by a General of the Demon King’s army, his main body is that mask! You have any ideas?
Satou-san, how did it turn out this way? That’s indeed a Demon King’s army general on the wanted list, the one who possesses foresight and clairvoyance. The devil of foresight, Vanir. What’s a big shot like him doing here?
That guy’s here to investigate the people who defeated Beldia, a general of the Demon King’s army. He had another more troubling objective, but let’s talk about that later. Right now, I’ve sealed him using the talisman you gave me. He’s that mask on Darkness, and he’s trapped inside her right now.
Trapped… In her body? You sealed a general of the Demon King’s army inside the body of your comrade?! What’s wrong with you? What were you thinking?
… But, this situation’s not good. That devil can even endure a hit from Aqua’s exorcism spell. He can do so because he’s possessing Darkness’s body. Crusaders are holy knights that serve the gods, that’s why Darkness has strong resistance against light magic. It’d be better to tear off the talisman and release that devil for now.
Release that guy? He’s trapped in Darkness’s body right now, so he can only attack with a long sword. But that devil said he could use a killing laser. That’ll be hard to handle if we release him from Darkness’s body.
… This… This is bad… If this goes on…
… Things don’t look good…
Damn! That Darkness is so strong…!
I can’t hit her! She parried my attack with her sword easily! Her strikes are heavy and amazingly fast! We’re only alive because she was holding back…!
Fuhahaha! This body isn’t bad! The strength and stamina are great! The resistance against holy magic makes it even more splendid! (Boohoo… I’m causing trouble for the other adventurers, but I’m a little happy to gain the upper hand against so many opponents…!)
Hey Darkness! Enough, stop thrashing around–! Do you or don’t you want to be saved? Or are you feeling great because you’re showing the adventurers who looked down on you who’s boss?
(No-No, I’m not!) Fuhahaha! What’s wrong thou weaklings, come at moi! Don’t hold back!
Darkness, you little…! Acting cocky because your attacks are landing!
I thought you were the one that was the most level-headed in Kazuma’s party! To think that you…!
Surround her! Encircle that crusader!
(The-The one taunting wasn’t me!) Fuhahaha! No matter how many minions you throw at moi, I’ll beat all of you off! (Ahhh…)
She’s obviously being manipulated by the enemy, but everyone’s scolding her, how pitiful! Isn’t there anything we can do?
(Ahhh… The adventurers that talked to me so nicely are looking at me with eyes of disdain…!) I sense feelings of joy… Why’s that so? What’s happening…?
But she seems so happy.
… That-That’s why we have to save her! Don’t you have any ideas, Kazuma?
You’re so annoying! Why are you so hard to deal with?
That’s what moi wants to say! Damn it, how despicable to attack in waves! Don’t think you can play around because moi don’t want to kill thou, adventurers!
I think that girl seems a little blessed today. Her performance has been eye-catching in all sorts of ways…
Don’t just say that leisurely, think of something… Ahhh!
Fuhahaha! It’s time to settle our score, moi rival! To die under the blade of your companion, how blessed art thou!
Hey Darkness! I believe in you! You won’t lose to the devil, right? It’s… It’s fine, right? Hey, Darkness, can you hear me?
Satou-san, are you not going to join the battle? Aren’t that priestess and possessed crusader your party mates?! Are you not going to save them?
No, you should know that I’m just an adventurer. Guys that are stronger than me are falling one after another. I can’t turn the tide even if I join the fray.
You! What is with you?
Ka-Kazuma–! This is a big crisis! The biggest crisis I’ve ever met–!
Kazuma-san–! Kazuma-san–!
… You guys are really troublesome, ahhh!
Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! All right… Prepare yourself, moi rival! To think I can destroy thou in such a place, even I couldn’t have foreseen that! Oh, the weakest man among the adventurers present here… Thou true nature has been seen through by moi, allow this devil of foresight to give you my prophecy.
Thou who seeks peace and stability, listen well. Don’t waste your efforts; just pretend you didn’t see anything. Thou have good luck, but it’s canceled out by the bad luck of your companions. For your own safety, thou should find other party mates, that way…
The boy who values his safety before all else, what caused you to have a change of heart? No matter what thou do, it won’t help the current situation. Aside from the Vanir doll, I can also throw in a mask that looks just like moi. Just take these and be gone.
I-I don’t want such things… Anyway, what’s up with you Darkness, why did you let your body get taken over so easily? You got tamed by that devil who suddenly showed up in no time? Are you really a gullible and easy woman?
Fuhahaha! It’s useless, now… (Jerk, who are you calling gullible and easy? He didn’t tame me! It’s just that the way this devil’s manipulating and hurting my heart is too skilled…!) As thou can see, this girl can’t hear you any… Hmm… What an iron-like will, moi didn’t expect this. I’ve lived in this world for such a long time, but I’ve never met someone I couldn’t dominate.
Darkness, listen carefully. I’ll break the seal on the mask in a moment. It’s fine even if it’s just for an instant, but you must wrest back control of your body from Vanir. Then rip off that mask and throw it away. After that…
You… You moron… Are you on his side too?!
Kazuma, I’ll support you from behind! Use my buffing spells and destroy that devil like a hero!
Fufufu, I’ll help you from behind too. All right Kazuma, it’s time for you to awaken the power sleeping inside you. Stop playing around and liberate Darkness from that devil!
Fuhahaha! You want to defeat moi?! (If) you want to take off this (talisman!), come (at me bro). Shut up! Don’t snatch the cool lines from moi!
Didn’t the two of you hate that talisman? And now you don’t want me to take it off, make up your mind.
Brat, thou must have a scheme in mind. It’s all because of that woman who’s emitting bright flames, shrouding thou’s mind from me. But thou don’t seem to be planning to fight moi with swords… Hmm, thou must be thinking of using some skills, right? (It’s Steal! Kazuma must be using his best skill, Steal!)
You… You idiot! Why did you reveal my trump card?
Kazuma, the spell’s ready!
Great, leave the rest to me! Well then, time for me to move. Darkness, just like that time in the dojo, let’s make a bet! If I win, I’ll add in something even more overboard on top of my ‘overboard demand’. You can do as you wish if you win!
(Ahhh… To-To use such tricks at a time like this…!) Damn… Damn it… Don’t get taken in by the tempting words of that man! Don’t show your weak side, refresh your soul! Increase your power to resist his Steal…!
All right, I’m coming Vanir! Darkness, keep resisting Vanir. Don’t let him move!
Just a Steal from a mere adventurer! If thou think it’ll work on moi, thou art going to be disappointed! Just try it, don’t hold back…!
Tinder–!
… Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! (Ahhh… How despicable, Kazuma you scoundrel!) To think thou could trick moi, the devil of foresight, splendid!
Hey Darkness, show me your mental toughness! Take off that mask and throw it away!
(…! I can’t take it off…!)
Kazuma-san–! What should I do? Can I cast my spell?
No… Wait, the mask is still on Darkness! Even if you cast your spell like this, it’ll be resisted by her…
(Don’t worry, just do it.)
(If Aqua’s spell doesn’t work… Then don’t worry about me and cast Explosion, just blow me away with him.)
You idiot! No matter how tough you are, you can’t survive explosion magic!
(How would you know if you don’t try it!) Wait… Don’t be rash, let’s talk this over.
(Aqua! Cast the exorcism spell the moment this mask leaves my body!) How about calling it a draw today? (If this mask keeps sticking onto me, then cast your Explosion, Megumin…!) To fight to a draw with moi who is a Demon King’s army general and the duke of hell, it’s something thou could boast to others about!
I-I understand Darkness! I’ll do it once that annoying thing’s out of the way!
Kazuma, Darkness is insane… Even she can’t survive that!
(… Hey Vanir. The time was short, but it wasn’t too bad hanging around with you. So, at the very least… I’ll let you choose. Do you want to be purified after getting away from me, or do you want to be blown up by Explosion together with me? Which one do you prefer?)
… I’m a devil.
As an existence that opposes the gods, I don’t want to be purified. Fuhahaha… My wish for destruction’s coming true in an unexpected manner. Goodbye, it was fun possessing thou’s body.
(Do it, Megumin!)
If something unfortunate does happen, please be the witness and testify that it was my instruction. It’s the same this time too, I’ll bear the full responsibility.
Do it, Megumin!
Wow, you really have exceptional talent for useless stuff.
Of course, who do you think I am?
I don’t think anyone will doubt you if you claimed to be the goddess of parties.
… Hey, you’re thinking of something weird, right? Why are you looking at me with pitying eyes? It feels so infuriating for you to stare at me like this.
… This fellow gets along well with me, but it hates Aqua. So, it’s true that animals will be close to people with a kind heart.
The kind me was thinking about being nicer to Kazuma who had been troubled so much by everyone, but I just heard something incredible. Are you implying that the holy me doesn’t have a kind personality?
Yes, and what are you going to do about it?
Ugh… No more…
Stop messing around! Like I said, including the havoc during the trial, you caused the most trouble! If I had to rank the three of you by how much trouble you gave, it would be you! Megumin! Darkness! If you get it, then don’t stir any more trouble before my award ceremony! Just go to that wall and count how many lines there are!
Wahhh! Kazuma, you’re too mean! I didn’t get into trouble intentionally! The flood with Beldia and the barrier at the cemetery–everything I did was for the people!
Wait a minute, I should be the one who caused the least trouble!
Hey Lalatina! What a cute name you have.
Lalatina-chan~ Let’s buy some clothes that suit your cute name! I’ll pick some for you!
By the way, Lalatina… It sounds like some famous lady, so eloquent.
Oh, what is it Lalatina? Why make such a scary face; it doesn’t suit the cute name you have.
Ugh…!
Oh, it’s about to start. I’ll be back in no time, Lalatina.
Adventurer, Satou Kazuma-san!
In honor of your contributions in ensuring the safety of the city, we offer you our thanks. Further to this, we would like to apologize for the false accusation–
Next, Dustiness ford Lalatina! Your selfless spirit is admirable. To honor your stellar performance which lived up to the name of House Dustiness and to compensate you for your losses, the royal family has sent you a letter of gratitude and a full plate of armor made by a highly skilled smith.
Congratulations, Lalatina!
Great job, Lalatina!
That’s our Lalatina!
This…! This feeling of humiliation is not the ‘overboard demand’ I wanted…!
Hey Darkness, I think Lalatina is a cute name! I’ll punish Kazuma who spread this name out as a joke–have more confidence in your name, Lalatina!
– We’ll now present the prize money to Satou-san!
Adventurer Satou Kazuma and party! Not only did you defeat the Mobile Fortress Destroyer, you even took down the Demon King’s army boss, Vanir. In merit of your accomplishments–!
After deducting your debts and compensation for the landlord’s mansion…
I present to you 40 million Eris as reward!
Kazuma, let me tell Wiz about this. It wasn’t for long, but we shared a body and wrecked havoc together. I can’t accept the way he liked to toy with humans, but I don’t think he had a bad nature… I don’t know why he hated Aqua that much… Anyway, it might not be appropriate for a Crusader who serves the Goddess Eris to say this but–I didn’t really hate him.
Welcome!
Hehehe… Welcome! The girl who gave an embarrassing monologue while looking into the distance in front of the door, I want to tell you something too. I don’t hate you, but devils like moi have no gender, so I can’t accept your embarrassing confession… Oh, my, that’s an intense swell of dark emotion! It’s delicious indeed. Hmm, why are you curled up in a ball? Did you really think you defeated moi? Hahaha!
Oh, welcome, Kazuma-san! I heard your false accusation was cleared after you defeated Vanir-san! Congratulations! All that’s left are your debts, right? But no problem, Vanir-san is very proficient in making money…!
I did clear my name–but what’s with this guy? How can he be doing so well after taking a blast of explosion magic? Isn’t his existence itself a cheat? He’s not hurt at all!
What are you saying? Even moi didn’t make it out unscathed after taking such a grand attack. Look closely at this mask.
Because of the explosion spell, I lost a life. I’m Vanir MK II now.
Are you picking a fight?
Vanir-san was already planning on resigning from the post of Demon King’s General. Coincidentally, he was ‘defeated’, giving him a new lease of life. Vanir-san is no longer maintaining the Demon King’s castle barrier; he’s a harmless existence now.
Boy who came from a faraway place, the one who’s weak and yet wants to defeat the Demon King. This devil that can see through all things prophesize that soon, you and this whimpering girl will face your greatest crisis ever. The crisis will be so grave that you will regret your own helplessness. You will prosper in the field of business… Art you interested in listening to moi proposal?
I’ll gladly accept your request!
Oh, thank you very much, Megumin-san!
Explosion is art! I didn’t think the day would come when I’d be able to see Explosion, a spell far superior to Blast or Detonation, with my own eyes!
You’re right! You’re absolutely right, sensei! Explosion is art! Blast? Detonation? No, only Explosion can be said to be true art! Very well, I’ll let Klein-sensei witness the splendour of my greatest magic!
Kazuma, what are you waiting for? Let’s go! I’m feeling really great today. I’ll definitely be able to unleash the best Explosion ever like this!
How wonderful! I’m looking forward to your performance, Megumin-san!
– There really is a clear difference between the work of Klein-sensei and the other painters. In particular, the ‘Exploding man amongst the glittering sunset’ is truly marvelous.
There’s no need to address me as Klein-sensei. Just Gilbert will do, Megumin-san.
Anyway, Gilbert-san, you said you wanted to see Megumin’s Explosion, right? Where are we headed?
Address me as Klein-sensei, Kazuma-san. Ah, here we are. That’s it. I would like you to use your explosion magic on that.
… Isn’t that the Eris Church building?
Indeed, it’s the church of the detestable Eris Church. I’m a devoted follower of the Axis Cult, you see. The destruction of a church of Eris through Explosion shall definitely create a wonderful sight full of artistic merit…
Very well, stand back.
Don’t do that! Stop chanting in the middle of the town! Hey, don’t think you can do anything just because you are a famous noble! Blowing up a church is no laughing matter!
Okay, fine, how about changing the target to that run down magic item shop that looks like it’d run out of business any day now?
I know the person who runs that shop, but alright, let’s go with that.
I told you not to start chanting in the middle of town! That shop looks to be run down, but it’s still in business! It just doesn’t get that many customers! The store owner is still working hard every day!
I told you right from the start, there’s no way we’ll be able to complete it in such a short time!
I don’t care, finish dismantling it by today! I won’t pay unless it’s done by the end of the day! Or what, do you think you’ll be able to get another job in this down after going against a noble? If you understand, then hurry up and get to work!
First Klein-san and now that man… Are all nobles like this?
Please, call me Klein-sensei. And that man is an embarrassment to the nobility! Don’t lump him together with me! He’s probably an upstart who bought his title with money. I’ve never seen his face before.
Inspiration has struck me, Megumin-san! I’ve decided on the best situation to bring out the splendour of Explosion!
Oh, I’m all ears, sensei! Let me show you the ultimate Explosion!
… That upstart seems to want his mansion torn down by today. Blowing up his extravagant mansion right in front of that upstart… What do you think? Isn’t it overflowing with artistic merit?
Indeed! I too feel that it’d be worth a lot of points!
Hey, wait-
Alright, Megumin-san, please show me the pinnacle of art! Don’t worry, I’ll take responsibility for this. I’ll handle the damage to the surroundings, so go ahead and unleash your full power!
Very well, sensei! Explosion~!
Look at this! Look at this sight, Megumin-san! Look at the face of that upstart with his eyes rolled into his head! What a blast! This truly is art! I’ll have a decade of inspiration from this! Yes, this is what true art is!
Yes, this is art! This is what true art is, Sensei! Hahahahaha!
The red tea of the highest grade is ready, Kazuma-san.
… This is plain water.
Ara, ara, look how clumsy I am. My apologies, Kazuma-san.
Don’t worry, you can just make another pot of tea. Thank you, Aqua-san. I’ll drink this anyway.
Don’t wanna–! No! It’s cold outside! Hey, what’s wrong with you? Are you two idiots? There’s still snow everywhere, so why are you rushing to go out? Are you still kids? Are you on the same level of children who want to play outside? If you really want to, then go by yourselves!
It’s still cold
Don’t wanna
Who’s the kid again? Aqua, you’re acting just like one! Hurry, we’re going! You’ve lazed around enough in the winter, it’s about time to start working! Or else…!
Frogs and other monsters are turning active outside the town; I heard the farmers are facing losses. Adventurers are obligated to protect the residents! Hey, hey, Aqua! Release your hand now! If not…!
You’ll become like that!
Even I don’t want to be like that… But you should take care of that bum before talking about me!
Hey, you girls, even the gentle me will lash out if you do that. What are you all talking about? Calling me a bum is rude, okay?
If you have something to say, then come out of there first.
… Kazuma. It’s about time to come out of there, all right? Or else it’ll be a bad influence on Aqua. I understand that Kazuma’s very capable and the warming items in your country are outstanding, but the snow’s already melting outside. It’s time to get active again, okay?
That’s right, Kazuma. That kotatsu thing was great during the winter. However, it is time to let it go. Come, help me like you did in the dungeon back then. Hurry, together…
Freeze!
Ahhh–!
This… This man retaliated! Don’t push your luck, Kazuma! You’re lazing around too much even if the debts have been cleared! Get up now! Ah, what do you want to do with that hand, don’t resist and obediently, ahhh–!
Don’t look down on me. After all, I’m the Kazuma-san who crossed swords with Demon King’s Generals and high bounty targets. You think a clumsy Crusader and a silly Archwizard can defeat me? Come back after raising a few levels.
… Kazuma-san’s getting good at using tricks; how troubling. But I’m fine with that. No one will fight for my special seat if Kazuma stays in his kotatsu.
Hey, this is bad. I have an emergency; I need to go to the toilet. It’s a bit willful, but can we have a short truce? Sorry, but can you carry the mat to the bathroom door, please?
You take the other side. Let’s throw this man outside.
On it. Aqua, I know you don’t want to leave the fireplace, but lend us a hand. You just need to help us open the door.
Stop, stahp! That’s inhumane! Hey, stop…! If you don’t stop, I’ll use Steal! I’ll use Steal!!
We already took a bath together, so there’s nothing to be shy about. If you intentionally steal my panties, you’ll be branded a lolicon forever!
I… I’ve been seen naked and washed Kazuma’s back too; something like Steal… Steal is… Ughh…
Let’s go, throw this hikikomori turned bum out the window!
Don’t do that! Let’s, let’s talk! Right! When it gets warmer I’ll let you cast two explosions in one day! I’ll use Drain Touch to take mana from Aqua and let you use explosion twice, instead of once a day!
Don’t wanna! Why must my valuable holy mana be used to do such silly things? My mana stems from the deep faith of the Axis cultists. This is the important mana given to me by my precious devotees! I won’t let you!
She might say that, but I’ll take responsibility in getting the mana!
Ughh… One day… Two explosions…
Ughh… Steal… Steal… No, but it might not be the panties in one shot…
Satou-san! Are you here, Satou-san?
Satou-san, it’s terrible! The lizard runners outside… The town…
… Can I ask what you’re doing?
As you can see, I’m keeping warm, as it’s cold today. Ah, please close the door. You’re letting the cold in.
… Satou-san. You defeated two Demon King’s army generals and even took out the Mobile Fortress Destroyer. I have the highest praise and respect for you, but…
Ignore that bum. What brings you here in such a hurry?
Ah, right! Many monsters called lizard runners showed up and the adventurers in town are fighting them. The lizard runners aren’t that dangerous… But it’s their breeding season and the princess of the lizard runners was born…!
And so, I’m here at Satou-san’s place!
What do you mean? Didn’t the guild issue out extermination quests? Why are you here then? Someone will do something about it anyway.
What are you saying? Was it not Satou-san that said, when the Demon King’s General occupied the dungeon– ‘The obligation of the adventurer is to protect the citizens who live in fear of monsters’.
Hey, it’s useless to say that to the kotatsu bum over there, all right? I don’t think Kazuma, who cleared his debts and made a tidy profit, would work before the money runs dry.
Yeah, Kazuma has the lowest level among us after all. It’s natural for him to be scared.
… Hey, you, when did my level become the lowest here? Aqua, you… I remember your level being rather high after defeating all those undead. Megumin…
Level 26.
… Why is it so high?
I defeated the Mobile Fortress Destroyer and Demon King’s General, Vanir. Most of the minions were done in by me too. Of course, my level is high.
Darkness should be lower-leveled than me, right? You can’t hit the enemy, so you should have the most problem leveling up. I don’t know what lizard runners are, but it’s not time for me to take the field yet. Darkness, go grind some levels…
Fufufu–.
During the fight with Demon King’s General Vanir, the masked dolls he created were basically defeated by me. They were difficult for normal people to handle, so their experience yield was high…!
Pui.
Ahhh?
What’s Satou-san’s level? Satou-san crossed swords with a Demon King’s General before, so it must be really high…
Hey, you guys, ready your gear. We’re going to do some quests!
I think Kazuma can’t handle that woman. Did you suffer a lot during your stay in prison?
They didn’t do anything overboard, but they didn’t treat me really well either… She seemed to be thinking of me as an ally of justice or something. I’m the type who would prefer not to work and live a stable life, so I wish she won’t look at me with those expectant eyes
I feel the same way as that prosecutor and hold Kazuma in high regards. Even with someone stronger as an opponent, you’ll unscrupulously grab their weak point and run if things turn bad.
Are you praising or mocking me?
Yo~! Old man, is it done? Is my sword done?
Welco… Oh, it’s just you. That katana you taught me to make is done. The shape looks just as you described…
Oh… It looks great…! It’s not as pretty or sharp as the real thing, but it’ll do.
Sorry about it being imperfect! I researched that ‘quenching’ technique of yours but didn’t get it at all. Nonetheless, this is interesting work. You just need to write the name of the sword on this magic talisman and paste it on the hilt to complete it. This will be your precious sword from now on, so pick a nice name.
Kazuma, Kazuma, hurry up with the name. I’ve been staying home all winter and my urges have been piling up!
… But you cast your Explosion every day. Be patient, naming a weapon is important. I need to think about it carefully…
Here, the full plate armor for men you ordered. I just put lots of adamantite in it, a high-quality equipment for the adventurers of this town. Use it with care.
How is it? It fits just fine, right?
… It’s too heavy, I can’t move.
… Is, is that so…
All that’s left is the naming of the sword. I have to do it seriously… Kiku-Ichimonj… Kogarasumaru…
Chunchunmaru.
… What did you just say?
I said Chunchunmaru. Its name is now Chunchunmaru.
How can you call it such a strange name? This is an expensive custom-made item, okay? As my precious sword, I have to give it a cool name…
Ah!
… Miss, you already wrote the name down…?
I did. From today onwards, this sword shall be known as Chunchunmaru. It’s settled, Kazuma! Let’s do a quest!
You, you, what have you done? Ahhh…! My sword…!
– Hey you… That sword cost a lot of money, and you just… If I use this sword to defeat the Demon King, it’ll be displayed in a museum and be labeled ‘The weapon of the legendary hero, holy sword Chunchunmaru’–how are you going to fix that?
I already picked a cool name in the place of the indecisive Kazuma. What are you unhappy about? Putting that aside, can Darkness convince Aqua to come out?
Don’t wanna–! I don’t wanna go today! Tomorrow! I’ll go if it’s warm tomorrow! I have a bad feeling about today! My instincts as a goddess are telling me so!
Stop spilling nonsense about goddesses! Hurry up, stop grabbing the couch… Ah! Don’t… Don’t pull my hair!
Darkness, let Aqua watch the house since she’s so unwilling. The three of us will be fine.
As expected of Kazuma! It doesn’t happen often, but you can say good things sometimes! Look Darkness, Kazuma-sama already said it, so unhand me!
Never mind that–the two of you, this is our first quest in a long time. After getting the reward, let’s eat a good one outside. A hot-pot party!
That’s right, we’re beginning our adventure anew after the end of winter. For the long road ahead, let’s eat lavishly tonight.
Great, let’s have fun outside. I know a good shop that caters to nobles. I’ll make a reservation there tonight.
… Hey everyone, how about bringing the ingredients back and having a hot-pot party at home? Right, I’ll prepare the ingredients for everyone who’ll be tired after adventuring. So, I think it would be better to have a party here.
Please watch the house.
Wahhh, I was wrong, don’t leave me behind–!
All right, this is a good spot. Let’s begin!
I’m ready, no problem! I’ll let the weak Kazuma level up fast and take out the Demon King for me soon.
Yeah, Aqua’s support spells are taking effect. With this, I can take on any number of them!
Leave any stragglers to me. I’ll blow them all away if they get too close.
Then let’s get it on! Proceed as planned! I’ll Snipe the king and the princess runner! Without those two, the lizard runners should disperse, so we can ignore the small fries. If the Snipe fails and they charge at us, I’ll snipe again while Darkness holds them off them. If it still fails, Megumin will blow them all away with Explosion before they surround us. I’ll take out any stragglers from up high, and Aqua will support everyone with magic… All right, begin!
Hey Aqua, there’s a lizard runner with a crest-like horn on its head. I know that’s the princess, but which one’s the king?
How would I know which one’s the king? The king runner… Should be the one that looks like it’s full of itself, right?
Oh, leave it to me, Kazuma! I have an idea! If the winner of the race is the king runner, then it must be the fastest! Amongst my holy spells, there’s one that does the opposite of repelling enemies and attracts monsters! If we call the lizards over, the first one to get here must be the king!
Hey, what are you saying? Do creatures like goddesses have the habit of pouring oil onto fire? I already found the king, so don’t…
False Fire!
They are fast!
You moron, do you feel unhappy unless you mess something up? No one asked you to pretend to be a retard, so clean up your act! It would be over if I took out the king and princess, so why the hell are you drawing them here?!
Why, why are you saying all this suddenly?! I only wanted to help, why are you so angry? Ahhh, I knew it! The development will be the same as usual, right?! The lizards will mess me up bad! I already knew this was coming, so get it over with!
Cast support spells and healing you fool! Don’t lie there, you’ll get trampled!
Hey Aqua, don’t just lie there! I took out the one that looked like the king, but they became even more aggressive!
If you take out the king first, the other lizards will be fired up since they have the chance to be the new king. You should’ve taken out the lizard princess first.
Tell me something that important earlier… Ahhh! Me-Megumin! Megumin! Is your spell ready? I permit the use of Explosion! The distance is enough, so blow them all away!
Leave it to me, wahahaha! Taste my explosive magic! Explosion–!
? Ahhh! Mana! Kazuma, I don’t have enough mana to cast Explosion!
Ah? Why at a time like this…? Oh crap!
What… What… What do we do, Kazuma! The princess runner! The princess runner is really…!
Hahaha! Bring it on–!
Wahahaha! Ka, Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san!!
Hold them off a little while longer Darkness! I’ll take care of them now!
Don’t mind me! Ahhh! You… You can take your time, ugh–!
Kukyeee–!!
Snipe!
In the nick of time…!
Ka- Kazuma? Are you okay? Aqua! Kazuma fell in a weird position! Use healing magic…
… Um, please live carefully, all right? It took a lot of effort to break the rules and revive you… Senpai will forcefully resurrect you anyway, but I’m always the one who suffers…
Sorry, I have nothing to say for myself this time, my apologies!
You are an adventurer, so it’s understandable for you to encounter dangerous situations. I know that, but… You were too careless this time…
Um… What happened to the others after I died? Are they okay?
Yes, there’s no problem. Senpai was trampled on since she laid down and pleaded for help mid-way… But while Darkness was holding them off, the lizard runners dispersed after the princess was killed. Megumin-san wasn’t hurt thanks to Darkness protecting her. Senpai is fixing your body right now.
… You’re really calm despite dying. The people who come here are usually more confused…
I’m used to it. Once in Japan, twice in this world. I’ve visited a total of three times now.
Won’t you feel bored staying in this room without anything to do? I don’t know how many people are in this world, but do people visit often?
That’s true. My job is to guide the people who died because of monsters… I’m usually busy, but the adventurers stay indoors in the winter and I’m thankfully freer. If I’m bored, that means everyone’s safe, so having nothing to do is great.
Actually, I don’t stay here all the time. Sometimes, I ask someone to cover my duties so I can play in the mortal world… Keep this a secret, okay?
Kazuma! Can you hear me, Kazuma? I already used Resurrection, so you can return now. Get Eris to open the door already!
Just wait a bit more. I still have many things to say with Eris-sama. Please take care of my body before I go back.
Huh?
Ah? What are you saying? Don’t spout nonsense and get back here! Raise your level, defeat the Demon King and return me to heaven!
Hey Aqua! I’m tired of life and won’t be going back! I want to reincarnate as a baby and start over! Send my regards to the others!
Eh?
What nonsense are you saying? Wait!
In summary, Eris-sama, I have a request. I won’t ask for much–but if possible, I hope to be a boy in my next life. I hope to be born into a family with a beautiful elder step sister and a cute younger sister.
Wait, wait a minute! Please, please wait!
Kazuma! Darkness said that if you’re not coming back, she’ll doodle on your face! She’s excitedly holding a marker now!
…? What are you doing Megumin? What are you doing to Kazuma’s clothes…? Hmm, Megumin? Wait, wait, Megumin?
Hey, hey stop! What are you all doing to my body? Don’t desecrate the dead, you’ll be cursed!!
Megumin! Megumin!! Wait, Kazuma-sama! Come back! Hurry!!
Hey stop it! Aqua, stop Megumin! Stop…! E, Eris-sama, please! Please open the door! I beg of you!!
Well then, Kazuma-san. I’ll pray that you will not come here again. Have a safe trip!
… Hey, what are you doing? I even thought of you as the only one with common sense, except for being an explosion maniac with a strange name; what did you do to me?
Hey, if you have any comments about my name then let’s hear them… It’s all your fault for joking about ‘not coming back’. If you throw such a tantrum again, I’ll do something even worse.
… Hey, what did you do to me? Depending on what happened, I might be too shy to look Megumin in the face from now on.
… What are you making a sacred goddess say? Ask her yourself.
Hey, tell me Megumin. If not, I’ll be very conscious of you from tomorrow onward…
You’ll know after taking a bath at home… That aside, how’s your head? Anything wrong?
Kazuma, your head was bent in an incredible direction. I thought you were acting out a scene from ‘The Exorcist’. Your wounds are serious, so no fighting for the next two weeks.
Let’s retire early for the day. Look, thanks to Kazuma the lizard runners have dispersed. Thank you for your hard work. I’ll report to the guild, so go back and rest, Kazuma.
Speaking of which… Why did you say something so silly, Kazuma? You’re living a wonderful life surrounded by beauties; what are you so unhappy about that you’d refuse to come back?
… Fufufu.
Ah!
Hey, I think you’ve been looking down on us recently, right? Didn’t I revive you too today–although Kazuma didn’t want to! Hey, stop treating me like an unwanted child! Revere me more! If you go to the capital of water and hot springs, Alcanretia, you can find lots of my statues and merchandize!
Moron, when did I treat you like an unwanted child? Without you, who will clean the toilet? For someone who proclaims to be the goddess of water, there are few places more suitable for you to clean than that, right?
That’s what I’m talking about! I’m the goddess of water, not the goddess of the toilet!! I’m saying your attitude is bad, you have to treat me nicer!
Where’s Megumin? She isn’t back yet?! That stupid loli, don’t think I’ll hold back just because she’s a kid! I’ll strip her with Steal and let her enjoy the same treatment!
Megumin said she would stay in the inn with her friend for a few days after visiting the adventurer’s guild– ahhh?
… Hey Kazuma, having confidence is a good thing, but I think being too cocky isn’t good.
Mo-Moron! Weren’t you there when Megumin wrote this? Damn, damn you, ahhh!
I apologize for what happened earlier… Please turn back into the old Kazuma.
I’m not bothered by such trivial matters. There’s no need for quarrels if you have money. Forget that. How about having some tea, Megumin? I received a huge batch of quality tea leaves.
I’m really sorry! It was all my fault, so please turn back into the old Kazuma! The current Kazuma’s really disgusting! Please! Please!!
Why do you keep saying strange things like, ‘Turn back to the old me’. I’m always like this.
The red tea of the highest grade is ready, Kazuma-san.
… This is plain water.
Ara, ara, look how clumsy I am. My apologies, Kazuma-san.
Don’t worry, you can just make another pot of tea. Thank you, Aqua-san. I’ll drink this anyway.
What’s happening? What happened these few days while I was away? Please, turn back to normal you two!
That loli bitch, ahhh! I’ll strip her when she comes back! Absolutely! I’ll do it! I’ll make that wild kid beg for mercy!
You’ll be arrested if you do that, Kazuma. In-Instead of that, can you tell me specifically how you’ll make Megumin beg for mercy…
Stop making a fuss so early in the morning. Really, stop squabbling. Everyone should be calm like me. Other than taking a bath, I’ve been in this spot after coming back yesterday.
I don’t want a bum who spends the entire day right on the couch to say that about me! Damn it! That ink is hard to wash off after it dries! I won’t forgive that girl! I can see her crying face right before my eyes!
Tell me in detail how you will make her cry…
Is that Megumin? You came back?
In detail… Um, that…
Hahaha! Did you think it was the Crimson Demon girl with a screw loose? Too bad, it’s moi! As the stubborn shop owner who has an amazing talent in holding on to trash is terrible at judging things, moi, who can see though all, will negotiate with you. Rejoice at moi arrival and be honored by moi presence. Come, let me see the merchandize you plan to place in our shop…! Hmm?
Hey, how did you get in here? There’s a holy barrier meant keep out harmful insects like you.
Ahhh. You mean that half-baked thing that was covering the mansion? So, it was a barrier. It was too weak, so I thought it was a failed product by a rookie priest. Pardon moi, but it broke when the powerful moi merely passed through it.
Ara, ara, although you’re saying that, you’re tattered all over, Devil-san. How should I say this…? I never thought the legendary duke of hell would get so beat up over a barrier of this level.
Ahahaha! This body is but dust anyway! Moi have plenty of substitutes. Moi was just curious about the quality of that thin layer outside the mansion. Well, it isn’t too bad for a newbie priestess, huh? Quite good for a human… And a rookie priestess! Hahaha!
Hey, hey, this looks bad. Darkness, help me stop these two…! … What are you doing there? Why are you turning away?
… It’s nothing.
Hey, you two, I know it’s in your nature to fight, but this is my house. Cut it out.
Hey Kazuma, I don’t know the specifics–could it be that you’re making things like the kotatsu in order to do business with that thing? Hey, are you going to collude with that pest? With that parasite that steals souls and is always finding trouble with humans to live off their negative emotions? Really, what an unfunny joke! Fufufu!
Ahahaha, Devils like moi are most trustworthy since we honor our contracts, unlike those who target innocent people and gather them with lies like ‘Believers will receive salvation’; a bunch of scammers who cons money under the guise of helping the poor. What’s the common phrase they use… Ah, like ‘God’s always watching over you’. Hoho, how preposterous! So that guy who was recently caught peeping at the bathroom with gentle eyes is a god?! Ahahaha!
Sacred Exorcism!
Elegant Shedding!
Ahahaha, so this is it! This is your true body! I caught it! I finally caught it! Well then, what should I do?! How should I deal with this thing?
Ahahaha, even if you destroy moi mask, there will be a 2nd or 3rd me one day…! Hey, don’t pull moi mask off while I’m talking, moi body will crumble! At least wait for moi to say moi line…
Hey calm down. It’s about time you two cut it out.
Hmm. Moi judgment of you was spot on. This will sell. It’ll sell well. This kotatsu thing is also a great tool to keep one warm.
Hmm, give moi a quote then. The previous agreement was ten percent revenue of the sold products to be paid monthly… But brat, are you interested in selling the intellectual rights of the products themselves? Including these items, moi am willing to buy it for three hundred million eris.
Three hundred million?
But moi thinks getting the monthly payout is a good idea too. After setting up the manufacturing line, you can get one million eris every month. We can nail down the details when we move into the retail phase… By the way, what’s this thing used for?
This is known as a ‘balloon’. It’s a toy that’ll become bigger if you blow into it. Let me play with it.
Oh. Give me one too…
Anyway, wouldn’t people notice if you walked around town in that get up?! Wouldn’t people shout, ‘That’s a Demon King’s General’ and attack you?
Huh? What nonsense are you saying? This mask is different from moi previous one. Can’t you see the ‘II’ shining brightly on moi forehead?
Kazuma. The personality of that devil’s problematic, but he won’t do things like arson, murder or robbery. He seems to have given up on the maintenance of the Demon King’s castle barrier, so the higher ups in the adventurer’s guild want to observe him for now. Besides, he’s staying in Wiz’s shop, so if anything happens, the reputable shop owner will stop him in time.
In summary of the above, the Demon King’s General is deemed to have been defeated. The guild won’t ask for the bounty money to be returned.
Hmm. It’ll take some time before the product is ready for retail. We can decide on the payment method then. Moi am a bit worried about the shop and will take moi leave now.
That’s great. Or else you’ll stink up my holy sanctuary. Go, get lost!
– These two have been acting this way ever since then.
I see. I finally understand why these two are acting like fake celebrities.
Anyway, it’s great that we have money. Since funding’s no longer a problem… Let’s do some grinding quests! We need to keep raising Kazuma’s level!
Ah? Don’t wanna, what are you saying? We already have so much money, why do we still need to work and raise levels? That doesn’t matter anymore.
… Ah?
Remember what happened last time? We prepared the equipment and drew up a battle plan, but I still died. I’ve decided. I won’t go adventuring anymore. I’ll work on my business from now on. I won’t do dangerous work like adventuring, but instead lead a stable, peaceful life.
Hey Kazuma-san, that won’t do. If the Demon King isn’t defeated, that would be a problem for me.
Then we’ll make more money and hire lots of powerful adventurers. They’ll help us raise our levels and then help in battling the Demon King. That’s right, we’ll lead an army of high level adventurers to invade the Demon King’s castle. How does that sound? Taking down the Demon King sounds much more realistic, right?
That’s right! As expected of Kazuma-san! We’ll slap the adventurers in the face with our money and squeeze their value dry. After they’ve whittled the Demon King’s health away, we’ll go in and deal the final blow!
That’s the way. As expected of the one who’s been with me the longest, you’re sharp.
I-I won’t acknowledge defeating the Demon King through the power of money! I won’t acknowledge it! What do you think the Demon King is?! The existence of Demon King requires training and leveling up with comrades, awakening your mysterious power, before finally taking him down after a hard-fought battle! What the heck do you mean by hiring high-level adventurers to defeat the Demon King?
No, that might be so, but considering it pragmatically, no matter how high our levels get, there’s still a limit. Even if I equip the most expensive equipment and get to a super high level, I’ll still definitely die to the Demon King in a single blow… After defeating the Demon King’s Generals and dispelling the barrier, how about hiring tons of high-level thieves and asking them to use the Lurk technique to assassinate the Demon King…?
What’s with this shameless fighting style? That should be the way the Demon King’s army fights, correct? Say something, Darkness! I have a feeling these two will get worse with each passing day… Darkness?
No… While watching Kazuma slowly turn into a bum, I’m curious how much of a jerk he’ll become… Will he laze around and drown himself in alcohol and women, and start splurging his money…? And in the end, he’ll say to me– ‘Hey Darkness, use your slutty body to earn me some cash…!’ With the belief that Kazuma would turn over a new leaf one day, I’ll start prostituting myself…!
There’s another depraved one over here! Ahhh, really, what should I do?!
Hey Megumin, don’t lump me together with that pervert. I’m someone who died recently, okay? I even broke my neck in the fight with the lizard runners, at least let me recover my wounds in peace.
Didn’t you hurt yourself after falling from the tree? Normally you would need time to heal, but didn’t you recover completely after receiving perfect treatment?
… I get it.
So, you understand. Well then, I’ll take a nap to recover earlier and get back to the frontlines. I made an appointment with Dust and the guys to go drinking tonight, so someone please wake me up in the evening.
… I get it. We’ll go to treat Kazuma’s wounds.
Treatment? It’s fine, I’ll get better after resting for a while.
Wait, what did you say?
Hot springs? Hey, are you talking about that? We’re going to the city of water and hot springs, Alcanretia?
Oh, hot springs. Sounds great. After consecutive battles with powerful enemies, I’m getting mentally tired. My debts are gone too. Splurging every now and then and taking a trip to the hot springs isn’t too bad.
Really, Kazuma-san, why are you acting so fake about this?
… I take it that Kazuma and Aqua are fine with the trip to the hot springs?
How about you, Darkness…?
– And after I become more and more depraved, I’ll say this! ‘Please don’t throw me away! I-I’ll do anything! Master… Ahhh!’
… It’ll be better to leave her to watch the house.
… Um, if Darkness doesn’t tag along, the journey there will be a bit hard…
It’s morning! Hey, how long are you going to sleep? Is everyone ready? Hurry and get up, move!
Of course, I’m ready to go! Really, those two keep saying I’m a bum, just how long are they planning to sleep?
Right! I’ll wake them up! Kazuma, you go to the carriage station and get the best seats for us.
Okay, leave it to me. But I’ll make a detour before going there.
Welcome!… Hmm, the brat whose active hours are similar to the undead. Why are you here so early in the morning? If you are looking for the owner, she has been burned to a crisp by moi punishment beam inside. Help yourself if you want to see her.
… Wiz is your employer, correct? Is it fine to do that?
Don’t joke with moi. If I allow the shop owner that collects junk free reign, we’ll be in the red even if moi works for a thousand years. She’ll bring in incredible goods when I’m not paying attention, wiping out all the revenue moi brings in.
No, actually… I’m looking for you today. I’ll be going on a hot spring trip, so I hope to discuss our business dealings after I return.
Oh, so it’s about that. The manufacturing line has not been set up yet, so you can look forward to your mixed bath.
I-I-I-I-I’m not looking forward to the mixed bath or anything, all right? My neck injury hurts, so I just want to go for treatment!… By the way, what are you packing? And why’s Wiz burned up?
That charcoal owner said while crying to moi, ‘This is an excellent product! It’ll sell! It’ll sell! So, Vanir-san, please don’t charge up your killer beam as you come near me!’. She was showing off this to moi. I’m planning to return it and I’m packing it into boxes… You want to buy it?
…? What is that, a magic item?
It seems to be able to help adventurers with the problem of going to the toilet outdoors. A magically compressed portable toilet that’ll be ready once you open the cover. To protect the privacy of the user, it’s designed to produce the sound of water.
That sounds great, isn’t that convenient?
The cons are that the sound to cover the privacy of the user is too loud and will attract monsters. The water creation mechanism is too powerful and will result in flooding…
Forget it then. Is there any magic item that you recommend?
Recommendations? How about the bottle that’ll explode once you open it, purchased by moi debt-ridden shop owner? Just thirty thousand eris for one. If you bring it to the bank and attempt to open it at the counter, you will get a large sum of money. How about one?
Who would want that? Aren’t there any normal magic items in this shop…?
The ditzy shop owner has extraordinary talent in buying things that can’t be used. She’ll buy weird things whenever moi isn’t paying attention…
… By the way, brat. You mentioned that you are going on a hot spring trip, correct?
…? Yes, what about it?
Can you bring this ditzy shop owner along with thee? To mass produce your products, moi needs a large amount of money soon. But with this thing in the shop, she’ll buy strange items and waste moi capital. This owner is only strong in her power as a lich. Moi foresight might seem powerful, but it can’t see the future of someone as strong as moi.
… So, you want me to watch over Wiz for a while? I’m fine with that, but I don’t know how the undead-hating Aqua will react…
… The shop owner who looked thin while wearing clothes actually loves the baths. This devil that can see through everything prophesizes: ‘During this trip, you have a good chance of entering a mixed bath’.
Leave it to me, I’ll take her there!
Hey, I thought I told you to save some seats for us… What’s that on your back?
Hmm? Eh, I’m fine with that. But this child’s fading away.
Hey, hey, is that really okay? Use recovery spell… Ah, that’ll have the opposite effect on the undead!
Calm down, Kazuma. Use Drain Touch and share your life force with her!
Traveling out of town, huh…? When I was little, my father brought me to the royal capital for the birthday of the princess. I haven’t left this territory since then… Um, what is it Kazuma? Why are you holding my hand– ahhh!?
Hmm…? Isn’t this Kazuma-san, this place is…?
You… You… You jerk! I was having a nostalgic moment, why must you do this every time…?
Ugu, I had no choice. This was an emergency! You have the most vitality among us, so it had to be you!
Customers! If you don’t get on now, I’ll leave you behind!
Hey Kazuma! Let’s take that carriage! My judgment says that riding that carriage will be awesome. By the way, I want the window seat. I want to sit in the place where I can see the scenery clearly. Hey Kazuma, go buy the tickets. Go do it now so no one else can buy the seats on the wagon!
… Hey gramps, why has one of the seats been taken? What is this? It’s so bothersome.
Customer, that’s a young red dragon. Its owner is on that carriage over there, but he paid the fees for this dragon. Even though it’ll be a bit uncomfortable, I’ll need one of the customers to move to the cargo compartment behind…
… And now, here’s the problem…
Rock-paper-scissors! I think that’s the best way to decide in this situation!
Um, well… I think I should go since I joined it out of the blue…
No Wiz. We should do this fairly. All right Aqua… Rock-paper-scissors, huh? No problem.
Huh?
Then let’s go! Rock-paper-scissors!
Who said it was by elimination? The rule is that the five of us keep playing until only one loser emerges.
That’s bullshit!
Hey Aqua, want to duel with me? I’ll play three rounds one-on-one with you. If you win just one time, I’ll go sit in the cargo compartment.
Really?… Kazuma’s an idiot, right? Do you even know what the laws of probability are? Kazuma’s chances of winning three in a row is astronomically low.
I’ve never lost in rock-paper-scissors.
– This isn’t right! Something is wrong! You must’ve cheated! Please, once more! If I lose again I’ll go sit in the cargo compartment!
Don’t go back on your words, okay? If you throw a tantrum again, I’ll tie you up with a rope.
So, you accept, right? No take backs Kazuma! I don’t know how you’re cheating, but if you want to play it that way, I have something up my sleeves too! Blessing!
Ah! That’s dirty!
Luck is part of one’s skill, including luck bestowed by magic! Let’s go! Rock-paper-scissors!
Why?!
Actually, I’ve never lost in rock-paper-scissors since I was little. It’s incredible.
Despicable! This is a scam! This is cheating, a cheat ability! You’re born with such a unique power? Then bringing me to this world as your cheat item is void! Send me back now! Let me go back to the heavens you shitty cheater!
Are you looking for a fight? You’re telling me my special power is ‘winning in rock-paper-scissors’? Are you stupid, how can I fight with monsters with such an ability? You want me to tell the Demon King, ‘Stop bothering the people if I win rock-paper-scissors’, you dumb broad?
But! But!!
The most infuriating thing is you claiming to be my cheat item! Don’t make me laugh, what kind of cheat is that? If I can exchange you for a unique cheat ability, I would’ve done it a long time ago!
Waaahhhh! You dare say that? That hurts! Stop pulling my cheeks!!
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-sama! My butt hurts. It really hurts. Isn’t it about time for someone to swap places with me!
I’ll trade places with you at the next resting stop. Just bear with it until that happens.
Wouldn’t it be better for me to change with her? By the way, why did Vanir-san suddenly ask me to go on vacation? Hehe… Vanir-san always shows his kindness in small ways like this. He’ll say, ‘Wiz, just sit at the counter and smile at the customers. Please don’t work.’ He cares deeply about me…
Hmm~? That strange masked man is a devil, but he takes such good care of others? Does he have some hidden motives?
… Hey, what is that?
Excuse me, I can see a cloud of dust coming our way. They are approaching really fast… Do you know what that could be?
Dust cloud? A creature in the vicinity that’s fast enough to kick up a cloud… sounds like the lizard runners, right? But I heard the princess runner that was leading the pack was defeated, so it might be a sand whale shooting out sand? The only other creature that fits the bill would be hawkite runners.
Hey, don’t look at me like that, customer. I didn’t come up with the name. This is a hybrid of a hawk and black kite, the king of birds. It’s a bird but it can’t fly. On the other hand, it has extraordinary leg power. It can run at high speed and will pounce on its prey, a very dangerous monster.
Don’t worry, customer. Like the lizard runners, these fellows’ mating season is during spring. To attract females during the bird’s mating season, the males will take part in a bravery contest known as a ‘Chicken Race’. They’ll sprint towards some hard object that looks like it’d be very painful if they crash into it, and then avoid it at the last moment. Some of them won’t be able to stop in time and die from the impact. These fellows have the instinct of searching for tough and hard objects. They’ll definitely crash into the trees or boulders beside them.
Excuse me, sorry for troubling you! I think they’re charging at us more energetically than before. Will it really be okay?
Kazuma! Some creatures are charging at us really rapidly! Or rather… I think they are staring at me! What… What a passionate gaze! Ah… Ah…! Oh no, Kazuma, this is bad! If this goes on, I’ll collide violently with that group speeding over here and get trampled…!!
So, it was you!!
Customer, I’ll pull over for now! That way, the escorts on the other carriages will protect this carriage and the customers!
Hey Darkness, those monsters are aiming for you. I hear they like to crash into tough and hard objects. They’re aiming at your rock-hard muscles.
Megumin, Aqua, we’re heading out! By right we don’t need to fight, but it’s kind of our fault that they are headed this way. We have to clean up after ourselves!
I’ll help too!
Vanir asked me to protect you! I know you’re strong, but stay in the carriage for now! Help me protect the driver!
Customer! Customer! You paid for the carriage ride! Please hide somewhere safe!
Adventurers! We’re counting on you!
Hey, that Crusader over there! You’re not an escort, so get back!
Hey! The monsters are heading straight for that Crusader…! It’s Decoy! Crusaders can use luring skills to aggravate the enemies! That Crusader isn’t an escort, but she’s still pulling all the enemies toward her!
Hey, that Crusader shows no sign of backing off in the face of so many enemies! So, so cool…! How… How brave…!
How can I let a paying customer, who isn’t even taking the salary for escort duty, face danger!? I’ll provide support, take this–Bind!
What?
Ugu? How disgraceful! To be bounded before the enemy! If this goes on…! I’ll be trampled by that group of monsters!
Could it be, she was afraid I would get targeted by the monster because of my skill, so she took the Bind in the place of the monster? I’m sorry! I wanted to support you but got in the way instead, forgive me!
Kazuma, Kazuma! It’s coming! The next one’s high! This is it this time! Ahhh, it’s going to crash!
Kazuma! Is this part of an anxiety play? Leaving the close shaves aside…! What’s going on? The horny males are jumping over me one after another…!
Hey, shut your mouth, there are other people watching!
All right, all right, well done. I’ll trade places with you after this is over.
Spells! The enemy moves fast, so use spells!
Lightning!
Blade of Wind!
Fire Ball!
Gramps, is there anything like a cliff around here?
No, there aren’t any cliffs around here… Aside from a cavern which provides shelter from sudden rain, there’s nothing around here.
Gramps, is that cavern nearby? If it is, let’s take the carriage there! Megumin, Aqua, get on!
Huh? Hey, what the hell; there are no knots? How in the world?!
Sorry! Once Bind is cast, it can’t be undone before the effect time is over! You can only cut the ropes one by one with something sharp like a knife…!
Kazuma! I don’t know what you’re planning to do, but don’t mind me, just drag me with you! This rope is tough enough, this is faster than cutting it one at a time! Don’t waste time, this is an emergency!
That’s true. But I don’t want you who made this mess to tell me that!
There are hawkites over there!
Hey, what should we do now? You’re too heavy, I can’t carry you onto the carriage alone!
Don’t… Don’t say I’m heavy. You need to specify that it’s my armor that’s heavy! Just tie me to the carriage with a rope and drag me along! It can’t be helped, this is an emergency! Don’t hold back, there’s no other way!
Hey, use this rope! Sorry for troubling you!
Customer, we have to go now! The carriage will get destroyed!
All right, let’s go gramps! Darkness, tell me if it’s too hard on you! I’ll undo the rope immediately!
Ahhh… I’m getting dragged by a horse while being bound by ropes…! And the males that are chasing after me while I’m like this…!
Hey Kazuma, Darkness, she–! I know Kazuma’s terrible, but this is too much!
This is going too far…
No, no! This isn’t my idea, it’s Darkness, she…!
Customer, what should I do? They’re heading this way! They’re gaining on us! Where should we go?
To the caverns! The caverns you mentioned just now!
Bottomless Swamp!
Um, ahhh… How, how shameful–! My armor’s clanking loudly! Ahhh, my cape’s all torn and tattered, how unnoble-like…! Don’t… Don’t look! Don’t look Kazuma, stop watching my torn and tattered appearance… Ahhh!
Heal! Heal!
Kazuma! I can see the caverns! I’m ready to cast my spell at any time!
All right, wait for my signal!
Gramps, stop the carriage when you see the caverns! Aqua, give me a strength buff spell!… Snipe! Snipe! Snipe!
Pihyororororoo!
Customer, we’re in front of the caverns! No one come here unless it’s raining, so you can go all out!… I’m braking, so grab onto something!
Ahhh? Good, such wonderful service! As expected of Kazuma! After dragging me with a horse, you’re now throwing me out as bait for the monsters… Ughh…?
Pihyororororoo!
Megumin! Now!
Explosion–!!
Here, eat more! Help yourselves! This is high-quality meat!
Speaking of which, that was splendid! To think we have such a great mage that can use Explosion with us…! And an Archpriest that can heal so many casualties so easily. And a brave Crusader who didn’t take a single step back in the face of the hawkite runners and took them all on…! The lady who created a swamp with high-level spells in an instant! Finally, your wise judgment to lure the enemies into the cavern to wipe them out! It’s perfect!
No, no, no, that was just a coincidence. Um… I’ve said it a number of times already, but we don’t need the payout for escort duties…
What are you saying? You were the ones that took out most of the hawkites!
No, no, no, really! I mean it! As adventurers, it’s only normal to participate in the fight in that situation! No need! We really can’t accept this!!
… What wonderful people you all are! My eyes have been opened! To think that there are still real adventurers like you all in this tough world !
It’s hard to do this when you all stare at me like that…
No, I think you’re repairing it perfectly. I think you can make a living as a blacksmith.
… Hmm, it feels great seeing my armor being fixed right before my eyes.
One more time! Aqua-sama, please do it again! Once more!
If you want money, I’ll pay! Please perform it once more!
… All right. Sleeping is fine, but please be ready to get up at any moment.
Hey, get up, Megumin. Wiz too, something seems off.
… Hey. Megumin, Wiz, wake up. If you don’t get up, I’ll do something that’ll make you too embarrassed to look at my face for several days. I don’t mind and won’t be troubled if you don’t get up. But with the excuse of waking you up, I won’t hold back. Can you not get up? All right.
How can it be all right? What are you planning to do?
Uwahhh!
… So, you really were planning to do something. No, putting that aside…
Hey, something’s coming! Everyone get up!
Hey, there are lots of them! They’re humanoid in shape but move too slow!
Wahhh!
Take care of her! I’ll get Aqua here, this is her time to shine!
Wahhh! What’s happening? Why am I surrounded by undead just when I wake up? Kazuma-san! Kazuma-sama!!
Attacking while I’m sleeping, how dare you undead! Lost souls, rest in peace–Turn Undead!
Ah, fu, hahaha, count yourselves unlucky to have shown up while this lady’s here! I’ll purify all of you from head to toe!
… Sorry…
What a beautiful priestess…! She’s just like a goddess!!
Ahhh, the zombies are being purified one by one…! This lady’s the comrade of the Crusader who protected us during the day…!
It’s rare for zombies to attack, but luckily that Archpriest-sama is here!
Easy peasy~ How’s that Kazuma? I’m a model goddess! I’ve been actively performing during this trip, right? It’s about time you give me an offering or two!
Ahhh!! Be strong Wiz! Someone… Wiz, she…!
Oh, you saved us again! I must give you all a reward this time!
Well then, please enjoy your vacation in the city of hot springs! Thank you everyone, you’ve been of great help!
Ahhh… Jarippa… Jarippa’s leaving…
What’s a Jarippa?
Could it be that baby dragon? Speaking of which, one of the customers that looked rather rich asked Megumin to help them name the dragon.
I heard that after a dragon’s named, it’ll ignore any other name it’s given…
The child seemed satisfied with the name Jarippa. I left the note with the dragon’s name on it. I hope the owner will cherish it dearly.
Can’t you change your hobby of giving things weird names? It’s about time you Crimson Demons understand how weird your naming senses are.
I fully understand Kazuma has no naming sense at all. It’s such a pity. Kazuma is a pretty nice name. If Kazuma has children in the future, let me name them.
I’ll never let you do that… Wait, what did you say about my name? Is Kazuma a good name by Crimson Demon standards? Hey, that makes me depressed.
We’re finally here! The city of water and hot springs; Alcanretia!
Welcome to Alcanretia! Are you here for sightseeing? To join the cult? To adventure? For baptism? If you’re looking for a job, please come to the Axis Cult! We have an opening right now to explain how wonderful the Axis Cult is. We are offering some very attractive compensations right now. If you take this job, you’ll get the privilege of calling yourself an Axis cultist! Come, come, come, join us!
What beautiful blue hair! Were you born this way? How enviable! I’m so envious of you! This hagoromo looks like the one Aqua-sama wears, it suits you well too.
Hey, don’t tell them you’re the real goddess of water. It’ll get us into big trouble. And don’t use your real name, use an alias.
I know that Kazuma, I’m not a dummy. Let’s go tour around! This is the city of water and hot springs; Alcanretia! As the goddess of water, I’m very excited! Most importantly, this is the main base of the Axis Cult!
?
Sorry, we already have a priestess from the Axis Cult. We’re here for sightseeing, see you…
Is that so? Then farewell comrades! May you have a wonderful day!
Welcome to Alcanretia! After joining the Axis Cult, many believers were cured of their illness, won the lottery and became skilled in their artistic talents! What do you think, want to join us?
… An-Anyway, let’s head to the hotel. I feel a bit guilty about this, but since we have the coupons, it’ll be a waste not to use them.
Please go on ahead everyone! I’ll go to the headquarters as an Archpriest and receive their worship!
… Kazuma, I’m a bit worried about Aqua, so I’ll accompany her. Can you help us bring our luggage to the hotel?
Welcome! The master has already informed us about your visit! Please enjoy your stay!
What about you Darkness? Since we’re here on vacation, I plan to go sightseeing and come back around dinner time.
Yeah, I’ll go too. I don’t know cities other than Axel well.
Customer, people will doubt your taste if you make purchases in such a cheap shop. Here, these are Arcane buns made from all-natural ingredients by the elves. It matches your high class status, try a sample.
Hey, don’t be cocky, jerk! Things that are expensive might not be good! Customer, try my special dwarf meat bun. It’s full of meat and will remain edible for a long time, a specialty that gives good value for money!
Elf…! And dwarf…! Hey Kazuma, there are elves and dwarves here! They look just like the stories I heard when I was little.
Oh, indeed. The elves were handsome and the dwarves stubborn.
Look what you did, the customer’s confused. He’s just here to look around, and now he is at a loss because you pressured him. Back off, lowly dwarf.
Stop your bullshit! The customer wants to browse my wares, he’s troubled because you’re bothering him! He wants to buy my goods, so scram, pale green elf!
Hey, don’t fight! Um, I’ll buy from both shops, so it’s fine!
Thank you for your patronage!
– Kazuma, the relationships between elves and dwarves is really bad! It’s just like the book my father gave to me when I was young!
Yup, they give off the feeling of being ‘real elves and dwarves’… Oh , I forgot to ask them about the places we could visit when I bought this stuff.
Hey you two, don’t fight–!
Ah, customer. This is the staff break room, non-staff can’t come in.
Oh, this–let me be clear. I’m a real elf, not a fake.
… Eh, what’s going on here?
Oh, well, elves in the forest don’t live together with humans and so their ears are long. For elves like me who live among humans, there’ll be interracial children over time, so our ears gradually become rounder. But if I say I’m an elf before the customers, they might be surprised or disappointed since it differs from what their impression are. That’s why I dressed up like a pure-blooded elf.
As for me, having a beard will cause hygiene problems. And I only work in the shop until evening. I prepare meals for the hotel guests in the morning and evening. It would be terrible if the customers complain about finding beard hair in their meal… Ah, are you thinking that we might still be quarreling? Sorry, that fight’s a performance we put on every day. After all, the rumor says that dwarves and elves hate each other, so we made use of that…
Ah… Sorry about that, did we break your dreams?
Customer, thinking too much isn’t good for your health. There are definitely clumsy dwarves and elves poor in bowmanship in this world.
Hey, hey, are you referring to me?
Forget it, I won’t ask for a refund or anything. Can you tell me about some sightseeing spots to visit? I’m here to ask that.
Sightseeing spot… Eh, there was a wonderful hot spring earlier…
Yup, it would’ve been great if you came earlier…
…? I thought there were hot springs everywhere. This is the city of hot springs, after all.
I’m talking about the mixed gender hot springs popular among the young ladies.
Are you for real?
Of course, it’s true. We relax there after work every day.
Actually, the water quality of hot springs everywhere is dropping.
That is so, some of the customers even fell sick and developed rashes after going to the hot springs… Some even fainted. Experts have already been hired to investigate why the quality of the hot spring water is going down, but it’s still unclear…
– How was it? Any good places to visit?
An-Anyway, let’s tour around there.
Oh? What should I do, the apples I bought…!
There’s a cafe set up by the Axis Cult ahead, want to head there and chat with me?
… Forget it.
No need to hurry, I might look like this, but I’m actually great at fortune telling. Let me tell your fortune to repay you.
No, no need… I’m good, let… Let go!
The fortune telling results are out! Misfortune will befall you if you continue like this! However, you can avoid misfortune by joining the Axis Cult! Come join us! How can you not join?
I’m already meeting with misfortune right now! Let me go! Help me Darkness!
Sorry, I belong to the Eris Church. Please stop coercing this man.
Pui!
…Pui!
Hey Darkness, um… How should I put this? The Axis Cult and Eris Church seem to be on bad terms, so keep that amulet hidden… And don’t take this matter to heart…
… Ugh…
… No.
Hya! Save me! You two over there, please help me! This man who’s probably an Eris devotee wants to drag me to a deserted corner…!
Hehe, do you happen to be an Axis cultist? Hahaha! If I see a strong and handsome Axis cultist, I’ll run away. Since you aren’t, I’ll proceed unhesitantly! If you want to stop me, who has been blessed by the dark goddess Eris, you’ll regret it!
Ahhh, why’s this happening to me! If someone signs this blank cult registration form, this evil Eris devotee will run away–!
Ahhh, are the two of you leaving me to die? It’ll be fine, just sign here and you’ll receive special powers from Aqua-sama and become powerful and cool! The Eris devotees will run in fear from this power!
That’s right! And after joining the cult, you’ll gain incredible abilities like ‘art and craft master’ and ‘attract undead monsters’ easily!
As you can see, I’m a follower of Eris. Defaming Eris-sama as a dark goddess before me is–
Pui!
Congratulations! You’re the one millionth person to pass through this street! Allow me to present you with a memento! This memento is sponsored by the Axis Cult! To collect this memento, you have to join the cult as a formality–you just need to write it on paper, would that be fine?
… Hmm? Hmm? Long time, no see! It’s me, it’s me! How’ve you been? I was in the same class as you back in school, don’t you remember? I changed a lot after joining the Axis Cult, no wonder you can’t recognize me~
… What’s with this city, or rather–what’s wrong with the Axis Cult?
Ah, Eris devotee customer, this is the special service from this shop.
Please enjoy yourselves!
… Hey Kazuma, let’s stay in this city forever.
… No.
Ah… Thank you, Onii-chan, Onee-chan…
Are you okay? Be careful next time, can you stand?
Uhmm, I’m fine! Thank you! … Hey, kind Onii-chan, can you tell me your name?
Kazuma, Satou Kazuma. This scary looking Onee-chan here is Darkness.
Sa–tu– Ka–za–mah? How’s it spelled? Please write it down for me Onii-chan.
Okay, my name is…
Fuck you!
Onii-chan–!!
Hey! Get me the person in charge! I’ll teach you all a lesson!
Oh, how may I help you? Joining us? Baptism? Or… Do. It. With. Me?
Do, do what…?
Don’t be shy, I’m just kidding. Why would a girl you just met say that? Is there something wrong with your head?
How may I assist you? The leading priest Zesta-sama and the other cultists are busy playing around under the guise of spreading the cult… No, they’re busy spreading the holy name of Aqua-sama. If you’re looking for them, please come another day…
Hey, you said something incredible just now. You’re causing so much trouble just to have fun?… Forget that for now, did you happen to see a female mage with an eye-patch and an Archpriest with blue hair? They’re my teammates.
Oh, so you’re a teammate of that great person. Your two teammates are inside.
By the way, your comrade there… The kids are throwing stones at her, will it be fine to leave her like this?
Hmm? … Ah! Hey, brats! What are you doing? Shoo, go away!
Ka-Kazuma… I think this city’s the best… Everyone, even the women and children glare at me as if I’m an enemy…! I’m going to lose it…!
Sigh, you better not wander around on the streets. You create way too much trouble. And put that Eris amulet away.
I refuse.
One of your teammates is in there. All the priests in the church are out right now, so this Archpriest is covering for them and hearing confessions.
Kazuma, I’ll search for Megumin. I’ll leave Aqua to you.
Oh, I beg your pardon. I saw the Eris amulet and thought it was trash, sorry about that.
… No, no, it’s fine…
Welcome, lost sheep… Come, confess your sins, the goddess will listen to you and grant you compassion…
Sheep your head, it’s me! Hey, what’s up with this city? It makes my head hurt. I can’t even sightsee properly. Aren’t they your believers? Can’t you do something about this?
… I see, this is the ‘It’s me, it’s me’ scam… Please repent seriously and deeply. The merciful lady Aqua will definitely forgive your sins…
Hey, I already said it’s me. Why are you still telling me nonsense? What, are you enjoying this? You’re tickled that you get to do something priestly for once, aren’t you?
Do you have anything else to confess? If not, please leave this room and live a forthright life…
Hey, haven’t you played enough? Listen to me! Aren’t you one of those Archpriests that are revered around here? The problem will be solved if you give the word, so go ask them to buck up!
I think you have nothing else to confess… Well then, I’ll wait for the next sheep to come… Please leave.
Hey, what are you talking about…? You’re chasing me out…?
I said leave! If your confession’s done, then get the hell out!
… Actually… I have something I need to tell you, priestess-sama.
? I’ll listen, I’ll listen! Here, here! I’ll share your confession, so repent! Do you have an unhealthy interest in your Crusader teammate’s underwear? Or the urge to plunge your nose into your mage companion’s black hair and sniff hard? Or the sins of treating your beautiful and elegant priestess comrade so crudely, even though you’re just a hikikomori?
Actually, I accidentally broke the glass my priestess teammate used for party tricks. I repaired it with rice and put it back secretly.
?
… Also, she was bragging after getting her hands on some rare, fine wines, so I wondered just how nice they were and tried a little… But it was too tasty, so I finished it all. I know she can’t appreciate wine, so I filled the empty wine bottles with cheap wine.
? What are you saying, Kazuma? Hey, what is all this about?
… That priestess caused me too much trouble… So, before I came to this city, I secretly posted a request in the adventurer’s guild to look for a new priestess of the Eris church.
Wahhh! You renegade, taste my holy wrath!
– Really, calm down. I was just joking. Anyway, Darkness and I got a headache dealing with these cultists. There’s no way we can tour around in peace like this. They’re your devotees, right? So rein them in.
It can’t be helped. This is the first time I’m facing my believers face to face… Anyway, you were lying about searching for a new priestess, right?
Leaving the first two aside, the last one’s a lie, so don’t worry.
Hey, hold it! Did you just say, ‘Leaving the first two aside’?
Is it fine for me to be here?
Welcome, lost sheep… Come, confess your sins; the goddess will listen to you and grant you forgiveness…
Ah… Please, please, hear my confession! I’ve been in the Axis Cult for a very long time and fervently worship Aqua-sama. But…! The drawing of goddess Eris, and those bountiful breasts… They’re enticing me! Those are the breasts of the devil! Ahhh… Please, please, forgive me for the sin of lusting over another goddess…!
Don’t worry, the goddess will forgive all your sins. Thou, give in to your love to big breasts. Thou, give in to your love to small breasts. The Axis Cult is a cult that accepts everything. Be it homosexuals, animal ear lovers, lolicons, or NEET; as long as it isn’t undead or devils, if there’s love and it’s not a crime, the goddess will grant compassion to all.
Ohhh… Ahhh…
Thou sincere cultist, I’ll bestow you with a holy incantation that will spare you from the clutches of the devil. ‘Eris pads her chest’–whenever you feel lost again, just repeat this incantation. If you see someone troubled like you, do tell them this too.
Eris pads her chest… I, I feel like my eyes have been opened! Thank you for your wonderful incantation, thank you very much!
… Hey Aqua, you’re slandering your junior. Is that really adequate for a goddess?
What are you talking about? For a goddess, the beliefs from the devotees are very important. It’ll directly affect the power of the goddess. Eris has a lot of devotees, while my believers are fewer in numbers but stronger in their belief. I’m willing to do anything to protect my precious cultists.
Kazuma… You’re finally here…
Hey, what happened, you look really pale.
This is like the home of the devils, let’s leave right now. I want to get away as soon as possible.
What… What in the world happened?
Are you going back already, Archpriest-sama? Want to visit the hot spring reserved for our cultists? This is the main source of income for the Axis Cult, the best hot spring in the city. Using it will improve your health.
Oh, that’s a great idea. What does everybody think, want to go together?
I want to return to the hotel and rest… And for some reason, Chomusuke’s very afraid of this church. Could it be this child hates churches?
I’m going back too. There’s no telling what troubles there’ll be when the other Axis cultists return. Let’s go back, I had enough for today.
Is there a mixed bath here?
You’ll receive divine retribution for saying something so despicable in a holy church.
Ah, welcome back everyone! Sorry for making everyone worry. I’ve already bathed and the staff told me where the mixed bath is. It’s much wider there. And there was no one there at all, as if I had booked the whole place for myself.
So, did everyone have fun sightseeing…? Kazuma-san, what’s the matter?
Ahhh, ten minutes… At least five minutes earlier and… No, no, no, I didn’t say anything!… Eh, nothing happened during our sightseeing today… I don’t want to leave the hotel tomorrow; this city’s weird.
The Axis cultists are too scary. I understand now why people say they’re as scary as the Crimson Demons.
I-I plan to tour around tomorrow, too…
You, you really…Sigh. Do what you want, I’m going to take a bath.
… I’m going to bathe now.
I heard you, take your time.
I already bathed, so please take your time Kazuma-san.
… I’m going to b–
Just go.
That damn cult’s finally going to be destroyed. The work in destroying the secret hot spring is now complete; the progress in the other hot spring is also proceeding smoothly. Now, we just need to wait. For us who have long lifespans, waiting a decade or two’s no big deal.
Hans, you don’t need to report such things one by one, I’ve already said this plenty of times. I’m here to recover using the hot springs, so don’t drag me in too.
Hey, don’t say that Wolbach. This is a great chance to destroy the cult we have no chance of defeating head on. I’ll come here to report periodically, so you have to keep visiting the hot spring in this hotel.
?
Did he hear what we said…?
No idea… And he’s staring at me…
… Hey, he seems to be only looking at me. What’s going on…?
… Eh, well… He doesn’t seem to have heard what we discussed. That isn’t a suspicious gaze, but one filled with curiosity.
Hey, hey, this is…
It… It’s better than being suspected by him. Ah, I have something to do, so I’ll make a move first!
… Um, you don’t seem to be a resident of this city. Are you here on vacation?
You could say it’s a vacation. I’m here with my teammates to enjoy the hot springs.
What a coincidence… I’m here for the hot spring too. But you seem so young… why are you here? To recuperate through the hot spring? Are you injured?
That’s correct. I might look this way, but I’m an adventurer. After a fight to the death with a powerful adversary, my neck suffered a serious injury. You could say this is like a badge of honour for men.
As for me… While I was fighting my other half, I couldn’t snatch my powers back completely. So, to recover my original powers, I’m here for therapeutic hot spring baths.
I think the mage in my team will be excited if you tell her that.
Hahaha, is your teammate a Crimson Demon? I wonder how that Crimson Demon girl’s doing. I even taught her magic… I won’t need to take a bath in the hot spring if I find my other half. However, it won’t be so easy to do so.
Well then, it’s about time I return… Also, maybe it’s better if you don’t visit the hot springs here anymore.
… Ah, um. Can you please not watch my defenseless body when I get out…
Don’t mind me.
Sigh… Such a wonderful hot spring city, and such a waste. I’ll have to search for a new place to recuperate…
Woah! The hot spring in our hotel is huge, as expected of a high class hotel! This is big enough for a swim!
Hey, Megumin, it’s poor etiquette to swim… Hey, what are you doing? The towel is… Ahhh!
This isn’t a mixed bath, so why are you being so shy? Adventurers have to take on dirty jobs all the time, so how can you be so squirmy!
No, that way of putting it is too weird! Megumin, you’re too bold! Ahhh, not my towel…!
Phew… It’s great to soak in a hot spring occasionally. I only wanted to drag the lazy Kazuma out and let him grind levels by fighting the undead Aqua would attract. It seems that choosing this place was the right move.
So that was why you told him to come here and recuperate in the hot springs. It’s true… If we had continued staying in Axel, he would’ve never agreed on participating in quests. What kind of man is he anyway? He’s conservative and timid, but doesn’t care about the status of others and has a strong attitude against the nobles… He gets chased around by frogs, but has the guts to fight the boss of the Demon King’s army. Rather than strange, he’s a confounding guy.
Shhh! Darkness, don’t say anymore. The mixed bath is on the other side. Given the choice of the male bath and a mixed bath, which one do you think Kazuma would choose?
Definitely mixed bath. That coward always holds back at the crucial moment. However, when he has a legal choice, he’ll openly choose the mixed bath.
Kazuma! You’re there, right? You must be sticking your ear against the wall and imagining which part of the body Darkness washes first and panting in excitement, right?
Me-Megumin! Why are you dragging me into this…? Hey Kazuma, you heard that, right? I know you’re there!
That’s strange, is he not there? But that’s impossible…
Eh… But no one’s answering…
It seems Kazuma’s really not there. That makes me feel guilty for suspecting Kazuma. I’ll nonchalantly treat him to some fruit juice later.
True, that was rude of me. We were blinded by our prejudice of him.
Anyway, he’s rather dependable. I have to repent on suspecting him…
That’s right. He might be like that, but he’s a man who’ll help when his comrades are really in danger. Aside from not being straightforward sometimes, his personality isn’t bad. I should reflect on myself…
By the way Megumin, it has been bothering me… Your buttocks there…
Hey, even if you’re the one saying that… I won’t forgive you if you go on!
Hey…! Wait…!
Really! What’s with this pair of lecherous things? If you can spare the effort to notice my butt, why don’t you keep those large things of yours away?
Ahhh! Wait! Me-Megumin, stop…! No, not there, ahhh…!
Now!
Pu!
Shya?
What did I tell you? This man’s definitely here!
As I expected! My guess was spot on, he always looks at me with such lecherous eyes! How could that man full of lust not be in the mixed bath!
Create Water!
Hyaaa!!
Hey! Don’t throw the cat over! It almost fell into the water!
That child hate baths, and I’m scratched all over after bathing it. As compensation for eavesdropping, give it a bath!
Hey, it’s such a rare occasion to visit a hot spring. Why can’t we go in together like a family? I’ve already bathed with the two of you before, so you won’t feel shy about it now, right?
That man always treats us like a burden, and will only spout nonsense about being companions at a time like this!
I can’t tell if you’re a jerk or a lecherous pervert anymore!
That… That’s so mean! I…! I didn’t do anything…! I only visited the bath!
Aqua-sama, how terrible… Um, please don’t cry anymore! When your tears touch my skin, it starts tingling. It hurts…
What is it now? Today’s a bad day, trouble keeps coming one after another!
What do you mean by bad day? What trouble? Why are you blaming everything on me?
Um… Aqua-sama went to the secret hot spring of the Axis Cult, and the hot spring there turned into normal warm water. After that…
They chased me out! But I’m a goddess! Why must I be chased out of the church worshiping me? That’s too horrible!
And…! The thing that made me angry was when I told the hot spring manager, ‘Sorry for turning the hot spring into warm water, but it can’t be helped since I’m the goddess Aqua herself!’, the manager… The manager, he… He laughed with a, ‘Pfft’!… I’m the goddess! That’s me!
…Pfft.
Waaahhh!!
This city’s crisis appears to be serious.
You’ve been acting this way ever since you cried the whole night. Aren’t your body traits the most dangerous thing for this city? Don’t you dare use any other hot spring except for the one that comes along with the room.
Listen to me! I didn’t purify the hot spring because I wanted to! Even if you pour all the high-quality shower foam Darkness was keeping in the bathroom into the bath water, I can purify it in an instant. It’s normal for me to purify a hot spring.
What? You used all the shower foam? They were luxury items I ordered from the capital!
But this is weird; I took a really long time to purify the secret hot spring of the Axis Cult. My purification power is beyond amazing… For example, …
… You see?
As you can see, I only need an instant to purify it. However, it took really long that time. This must mean that the hot spring was heavily polluted… I heard the water quality in all the hot springs was turning worse, right? That means the threat my Axis Cult will face isn’t a direct assault from the Demon King’s army, but a strike against the Axis Cult’s source of income–the hot springs!
Is that so? How amazing.
Believe me! I’m telling the truth!
Anyway, it’s just the water quality of a few hot springs turning bad, right? Why would you link it to the Demon King’s army?
Indeed, the Axis Cult is weird, does dumb things, and is unpopular with people, but the Demon’s King army won’t do something so troublesome because of that, right?
I’ll fight to defend this city! I hope everyone can give me a hand!
I need to go sightseeing, I don’t have time for this.
I experienced how scary Axis cultists are already, so I’ll pass this time. I’ll follow Kazuma today.
Why? Something like sightseeing can be done any other day! Megumin too? Don’t hate my devotees! Hey, Darkness…
Eh… I, um… Well…
Pleaseee!
All right, all right, I’ll go! I’ll accompany you, all right! Don’t purify my grape juice!
Hey, is Wiz still sleeping? Wiz can’t handle you at all, but she’ll follow if you tell her to.
Oh, after held onto Wiz and cried the entire night, I found her on the verge of dying because of my tears. She’s recuperating in bed right now.
Save Wiz first before you try and save the city! Wiz has been sleeping most of this trip because of you!
If there’s no good place to go, let’s head outside to cast Explosion.
We are on vacation, let’s take a break from that.
Good morning… Ughh, everyone’s up so early…
Good morning, are you feeling better? I heard you almost disappeared because of Aqua.
Yes, I even saw my teammates from my time as an adventurer waving at me from the other side of the river, shouting, ‘Don’t come over’… But I made it through in the end.
Wiz, do you have any plans for today? Megumin and I will be making a trip to the outskirts of the city.
I don’t have anything particular in mind… Do you two want to leave the city? The monsters around here are strong, all right? If you don’t mind, allow me to tag along.
Please do! Oh, it feels much safer being with a real mage.
Hey, tell me why I’m a ‘fake’ mage!
Hey, Wiz, when you mentioned your teammates from your time as an adventurer, I wanted to ask you… Why did you turn into a lich? This might sound inappropriate–but I feel Wiz is one of the very few normal people residing in Axel. Why did the famous adventurer go against the will of the gods and become a lich?
That’s true… It’s a long story, but I’ll explain to everyone when Aqua-sama’s present too.
Let’s talk about it with Aqua present then
All right, let’s invite Vanir-san to hear it too. When I was still an adventurer, I had a deadly fight with him.
Hey, how old were you when you turned into a lich? It sounded like a long time ago…
I was about twenty.
No wonder, your appearance is about that age too. How long have you been like this? Eh, how old are you now?
Twenty, my age won’t increase after becoming a lich.
…? No, that…
I’m forever twenty.
… Is, is that so?
By the way, I have something to ask you… Aside from Wiz, is there anyone else in the Demon King’s army who can use Explosion? Um… Do you know of a big breasted onee-san who can use Explosion?
No, as far as I know, I’m the only one who can use Explosion in the Demon King’s army. Also, it’s been a long time since I visited the Demon King-sama’s castle. Therefore, I’m not sure about newcomers who’ve joined after that…
I see, that’s great…
Hey, what’s this about a big breasted onee-san? Don’t leave me hanging, explain it clearly.
Why you… It’s nothing important. One of the reasons I visited Axel was because I heard there was a female mage that could use Explosion there. It seemed like that rumor was referring to Wiz.
Hmm? Then explain in detail what that has to do with big breasts?
At least say the whole thing. She’s a big-breasted female mage. I want to be just like her. One day, we’ll meet again…
You want to be just like her…? Do you mean the size of your breasts?
I’ll kill you.
… Hmm? I think I have seen that person somewhere before…
Hey Megumin, Wiz! Let’s hurry and cast the spell, then go sightseeing!
That’s true, let’s get the routine work out of the way and enjoy the tour! Wiz is here today, so I feel very safe! Just find some monsters and cast Explosion on them!
Ahhh, Kazuma-san, you don’t need to rush!… Hmm, who was that man?
Let’s go into the forest! There must be lots of monsters there! Let’s hurry and kill them all!
Yup, there are tons of them, and they already detected our presence… So why aren’t they attacking?
Because we came out from Alcanretia, they are wary of us. Most of the residents there are from the Axis Cult… I heard monsters tend to shy away from Axis cultists.
If there’s any other reason… It’s probably because I’m here too. They instinctively avoid me. I’m a lich, after all.
Ughh… It can’t be helped. Let’s settle this quickly. I wanted to cast it amid monsters and raise my level as well, but…
Explosion!
Hmm… Let’s go back then. Kazuma, please carry me.
Can’t you make things easier for me? It always turns out like this. I’ll share some mana with you, so walk yourself.
Hoho, there were a few hidden kobolds who got caught in the explosion. The adventurer card says I defeated kobolds today.
… Hmm? Something’s running this way. My Detect Enemy skill tells me that it’s really fast.
Oh? It’s coming even after hearing the sound of my Explosion?
Grrrrr!
Wiz, Wiz! Quick, think of something!
Kazuma use Snipe, Snipe! It’s still far away, so shoot it with Snipe!
I left my equipment at the hotel!
How could you be so careless? That’s why your level is so low!
You jerk, who do you think attracted all the monsters here?! Do you want me to drain all your mana and leave you behind?!
I’ll take care of it, so the two of you calm down! Leave it to me and get back!
Hey Wiz? Hey, hey–Wiz!
Ahhh!
… Eh?
… Oh right, other than attacks from weapons enchanted by magic, all physical attacks against a lich are harmless. Also, liches have Drain Touch, which absorbs their opponent’s life force, and can causes all sorts of abnormal status effects–poison, paralysis, sleep and curse, with a touch. For Wiz, she can defeat the enemy without using magic.
Phew… Let’s return to the city.
What’s happening? An event of some kind?
This is a tourism city after all, maybe they invited some celebrities to perform and entertain the visitors.
… It’s Aqua-sama. What’s she doing?
My beloved Axis cultists! Right now, the Demon King’s army is conducting destructive attacks on this city!
By destructive attacks, I’m referring to the poisoning of the city’s hot springs! I’ve already confirmed that many of the hot springs were hit!
I’ve never heard of that. I just bathed in that hot spring there and it seems to be fine.
That’s because I purified the poison in all of the hot springs. Yes, all the hot springs in the vicinity have been purified by me. However, we can’t let our guards down just yet! Everyone, please don’t visit the baths before this incident is concluded!
This is the city of hot springs, priestess-san. If you forbid the customers from visiting the hot springs, how can we conduct business?
That’s right, and why would the Demon King’s army poison a place like this?
They did this to cut off the tourism income for this city and crush the source of income of the Axis Cult! That’s right, the Demon King’s army fears the Axis cultists! I won’t allow them to stir any trouble just because they’re jealous of our hot springs! Please, faithful believers of the Axis Cult–
Ah! So, there you are! Hey, what did you do to my hot spring? It’s just warm water now!
Ah, that’s her all right! She dares to show her face around here! Hey–everyone! Grab her! She’s turning the hot springs in this city into warm water, how evil!
Yeah, she might be a dog of the Demon King’s army sent here to destroy the Axis Cult!
No, wrong! There’s a reason for this, let me explain! The hot springs I purified were poisonous! I admit that some of the normal hot springs might’ve been purified too, but this was for the sake of everyone…
If this is true, then you should’ve told us earlier! And even if you did purify the hot springs, it’s still impossible to purify such a large number! You must’ve sneaked in when no one was around, right? Using that chance, you drained all of the hot springs’ water away and replaced it with warm water for showering, right?!
That, that’s not–! Because if others saw me perform the purification, my real identity would’ve been exposed! That would cause a huge commotion…!!
Hey Megumin, Wiz! Let’s get out of here before she notices us! We have to pretend we don’t know her, understand?!
Hmm? She’s already made this big of a mess and you’re planning to abandon her?! It can only be settled if you intervene. Kazuma, hurry up and do something!
Aqua-sama’s going to cry, you know? Kazuma-san, if this goes on…
Is rumor-mongering all you can do?! The situation’s serious now! And who are you anyway? Are you really a minion of the Demon King?
Eh? No, I’m not! Hey Darkness, don’t just stand there, say something! And say the lines like I told you to– ‘Axis Cult, Axis Cult’s depending on you!’ Say it, don’t be shy, go on!
A-Axis Cult… Is… Depend…
Ahhh, really! All right, I’ll tell you who I am! Devoted Axis cultists, my name’s Aqua! That’s right, the object of your worship, the goddess Aqua! My beloved believers, I’m here in the mortal world to save you all!
… Okay, let’s go, quick! Megumin!
… This is bad. It might’ve been salvageable earlier, but it’s a gone case now. Let’s run!
Wait, wait–Kazuma-san! Megumin-san! What about Aqua-sama and Darkness-san…?
Don’t joke about this you heretic!
Do you think you can impersonate Aqua-sama just because you have blue hair and eyes?! You’ll receive divine retribution!
Death penalty! Tie her up and throw her in the lake! If she really is Aqua-sama, then she won’t die even if she’s thrown into the water!
Wahhh! No!! I’m telling the truth, I’m really Aqua!!
Ahhh! No, don’t throw stones…! No, no…! Aqua, hide behind me quick!
Hey, where are the two of you going off to? Aqua-sama, she…!
Wahhh!
A-Aqua-sama, I brought you some warm milk. Take a sip and cool down…
That’s so cruel! I-I worked so hard for everyone! Why must I be pelted with stones by my own believers? Wahhh!
Aqua-sama, please… Please calm down! Or else, your aura when you’re upset will cause me to disappear–!
… I want to drink wine.
You’re not upset at all, right?
No matter what, there’s definitely some sort of sabotage being conducted. Many of the hot springs I visited had been seriously contaminated. If the customers were to have visited these baths, they would’ve definitely fallen ill.
Since Aqua, whose only saving grace are her priestly powers, said so… Then it must be true, right? But we can’t find the culprit this way.
That’s true. Let’s just go to the adventurer’s guild and the hot springs’ management to make a report, and we’ll leave the rest to them.
Wooo… But if this goes on, my cute believers will…
I’ll give you a hand tomorrow… But I won’t participate in any fights, all right? If we can find the culprit, we’ll hand it over to the adventurer’s guild to resolve it. Will that be fine?
Well then, I’ll wait in the hotel. Please be careful.
Anyway, how will we know who the culprit is? Even if we find someone suspicious, we’ll have to catch him in the act for it to be convincing.
Hehe, leave it to me! I’ve already thought of a way to find the culprit! Listen, the culprit will visit several hot springs in a day. Visiting as a customer will be the least suspicious way of doing it.
We’ll then ask all the managers of the hot springs which customers they had the deepest impression of–I’ve already distributed survey forms to them…
You’re really working hard on this…
I see… No matter how much someone loves the hot springs, bathing several times in one go would be suspicious. By collating the customer that frequents the most from the managers, we can lock on to the target, right?
Also, if something happens to the hot spring that person frequents, it means he must be the culprit.
That’s the idea! Come, let’s collect the survey forms back.
– The results of the survey are out! The features of the most frequent customer are…
A woman with blue hair and eyes, wearing a light-purple hagoromo.
So, you’re the culprit.
Wrong! Wait! I did visit a lot of hot springs, but that was to purify the water! Let’s look at the survey about the water quality turning bad, the last one to visit is the most suspicious!
A woman with blue hair and eyes changed the hot spring water into warm water as a practical joke…
… Isn’t that also you?
Why? What’s going on? This is useless!
No, hold on!
Look, this ‘man with tanned skin and brown hair’ was second in his visit frequency to Aqua. Does he like hot springs that much?
So, he’s the criminal, as expected. He’s a tall man with bulging muscles.
… Hey, wait, what do you mean by ‘as expected’? Do you know someone like that? Were you secretly worried for me and investigated, even though you kept saying it was troublesome? Is Kazuma a tsundere?
No, the first day we came to this city… I met this guy by chance in the hot spring saying, ‘That damn cult’s finally going to be destroyed. The work in destroying the secret hot spring’s complete; the progress in the other hot springs are also proceeding smoothly. Now, we just need to wait. For us who have long lifespans, waiting a decade or two’s no big deal.’… Wahhh! What are you doing? Stop!
Why didn’t you say so earlier? If you had told me earlier, I wouldn’t have needed to work so hard!
Hey, stop it! I’m here to bathe in the hot spring and recuperate! Why must I be dragged into troublesome matters all the time?! Why would I plunge my head straight into trouble?
This man finally admitted it! Do you not have any pride as an adventurer?! No matter how you look at it, that’s the scene of the Demon King’s army scheming!
Aqua, I’ll hold this trash down. You beat him up good!
Hey wait, stop! You really want to go? Don’t blame me for not holding back!
Wooo… I was ravaged… He actually fought back…
What a petty man…
It’s troubling to suddenly ask us to do that. We can’t simply arrest this person with just your one-sided account. It might be a different story if it was Adventurers with good reputations who’ve been active here for a long time making the request, but it’s hard to believe some unknown adventurers we aren’t familiar with… At least give us some evidence…
Hey, since you live in this city… You must be an Axis cultist, right? Look at my face, does it look familiar?
…? I’m not an Axis cultist… Hmm, now that you mention it, I did see… Ahhh! In that shop downtown, the second most popular–!
Wrong! Say any more and you’ll receive divine retribution! I’ve never worked in such a dirty place before! And why is it second most popular? How infuriating!
Hey Megumin, back me up.
Back you up? What do you want–?
Look closely at who this noble person is! She’s the daughter of the Dustiness clan, the great noble family known as the ‘Beloved Shield of the Kingdom’–Lady Dustiness ford Lalatina! How impudent to say that she’s some unknown adventurer!
Eh?
My lady, please show the item that proves your identity as a member of the Dustiness family for the block-headed staff to see!
Hmm? E-Even Megumin? Uugh… To think I’ll use my clan’s name for such a thing…
This is really…! M-My apologies! We’ll put this man on the wanted list immediately!
As expected of Darkness! That’s how you use the authority of a noble!
Ah, Aqua! Don’t say such ill sounding things so loudly!
– W-We’ve started a manhunt for that man as instructed by Lady Dustiness; we’ll contact your hotel if we receive any news!
Ah yes, sorry for troubling you.
Ah, by the way, please charge all necessary expenses for the manhunt to the Dustiness family.
?
You jerk! Jeeerrrrkkk!!
What? I said I’m sorry already, right? Let Aqua pay for the manhunt expenses then.
Eh? It’s on me?
That’s not the point! My family name isn’t to be used so lightly…!
Hey Aqua, the Dustiness house has their hands full raising this pervert… So, pay for the bill, all right? Isn’t this for the sake of saving your cult anyway?
Ahhh… All right, all right. I get it, it can’t be helped. The Dustiness house has it hard, huh? I’ll pay then.
Nuaaahhh!
Wahhh! You, what, stop it!
Really, how long are the two of you going to fight? There are people watching. Darkness, you’re a lady in name. Act like one…
What do you mean by ‘in name’? I’m a proper lady! Ahhh really…!
Just like the time we fought the Destroyer, you’re useless most of the time. Now that you have a chance, you should do something that befits nobility!
That’s none of your business! Damn it, you’ve been playing me like a monkey since just now!
Hahaha, your attacks are too easy to read! How can your clumsy attacks ever hit me?!
I’ll kill you!
Stop being noisy, what are you two doing in public?
Forget it; People who don’t change their attitude even after knowing I’m a noble are rare.
Everyone always says that they don’t mind, but will still be slightly afraid of me…
I don’t care about nobles or peasants. Darkness is just Darkness, I’ll always treat you the same. The Crimson Demons doesn’t fear authority and will treat royalty and aristocrats the same, okay?
Megumin…
In the country I was from, there were plenty of people who complain about politics. I’m not concerned about status or gender and I won’t show bias toward a weird noble like you.
Even Kazuma… No wait, did you say weird noble?
Hey Aqua, tell her what you think too. Don’t let her flatter herself and be conscious about her status as a lady… Hey, what are you doing? What is that?
This…? Ah, this is a fake of the pendant Darkness took out just now. Look. It looks the same, right? With this, I can claim to be a child of the Dustiness house and say anything I want… Ahhh!
– Welcome back! Any progress?
We did something incredible again. It’s great that we stopped the schemes of the Demon King’s army… Hey Darkness, you’re a sheltered lady so you might not know this… But there’s a custom among commoners that a man and woman who go on vacation together must visit the mixed bath together. We’ll be going back tomorrow, so let’s get it done tonight.
? I-I’ve never heard of such a strange custom!
I already said it’s a custom among commoners. You’re a noble, so there’s no way you could’ve heard about it. If you want to break the gap between you and real commoners like us, you’ll have to follow the ritual at least once.
As if we have such a custom!
Coming, who is it?
What… What happened?
Terrible news! The hot springs…! Contaminated water is flowing out from the hot springs everywhere in the city…!
I think there are problems with the water source.
The water source? That should be the top of the hill behind the Axis Cult’s main base, right?
Indeed, it’s difficult to poison the hot springs one by one. The other party must’ve been pressured by the manhunt order and decided to hit the source directly–that makes sense.
But how did he infiltrate such a heavily guarded place…?
Kazuma, what are you eating? Give me one too.
I’ve been feeling that recently you’ve been dumber than Aqua.
?
Hey, what do you mean by that? Are you implying that I’m usually behave like an idiot?
Not like an idiot, you are one! … Ahhh, enough! I apologize, I’m sorry! You’ve worked so hard and used your head this time! – I already apologized, so return my pizza to me!
… Source of the water, right? Hey Kazuma, how long are you going to play around? Time to go! Water source! We’ll head to the hill behind the cult’s headquarters to investigate!
All right, let’s go to the water source and look.
Hey, I’m an Archpriest from the Axis Cult! Look closely! Hey, look at my adventurer’s card carefully!
No, even if you’re an Archpriest of the Axis Cult, I can’t let you through.
Only the manager of the hot springs is allowed to go in.
Thou devoted Axis cultists… Hear me, this is a necessary action. A just course. If thou allow passage, this city shall…
Ah, I’m a believer of Eris
Why?! Why do you follow Eris’s religion even though you’re living in this city?!… Hey, please, let me go in! There’s big trouble at the source! This is for the sake of the hot springs city! I-I…! I just want to save this city!
No means no! Go home!
Ah, wait! I suddenly realized that you’re handsome! Your profile’s just like a red dragon, dominatingly strong.
You mean my face looks like a lizard?
… All right, if you won’t let me through no matter what, I’ll make you Eris devotees taste some bitter medicine and run to the Axis church by the hill side to repent!
What nonsense are you saying?
Damn it, that’s why they say the personality of Axis cultists are so terrible! And your blue hair and eyes–you are not that person who was turning the hot springs into warm water, right?
No, that’s wrong! I was just purifying the hot springs…!
So, it is you! Even more reasons that I can’t let you through! Go back!
As I expected. You’re up Darkness, a rare opportunity for you to shine.
Rare? Hey, I contribute occasionally, okay! Stop, stop pushing!
Take a good look at who this great person is! She’s the daughter of the grand noble house Dustiness–Lady Dustiness ford Lalatina! This is an emergency and concerns the survival of this city!
Ah?
That is so, you can treat this as an order from house Dustiness. The hot springs’ contamination incident that happened yesterday should be the result of someone poisoning the source. We’re here to investigate on the lady’s order.
This is an emergency, but if I abuse my authority like this…!
Here my lady, please take out the pendant proving your identity that you’re hiding in your chest! My lady, please don’t resist…! Hey, cough it out my lady!
Kazuma, grab on tight! I’ll… Ahhh! That hurts, Darkness, that hurts! Wiz, Megumin! Use this chance to grab the pendant!
Wiz, you take her right hand, Aqua take her left… My lady, please stop your futile resistance!
So sorry! I’m sorry Darkness-san!
Stop it, all of you…! The Dustiness house won’t permit such abuse of authority…! Ahhh?
Here, look at this! You’ll grant us entry now, right?!
M-My apologies!
Please forgive us!
… Let me borrow this for a while.
Of course not, give it back now!
Um, Lady Dustiness, I know you’re here to investigate, but the manager of the hot springs has already gone in…
The manager said he would investigate the cause and to not let anyone through…
Is the manager a tanned man with short, brown hair?
No, he’s a blonde old man whose been managing the hot springs all these years.
There are wild beasts in the hills ahead. Please be careful if you’re going there, Lady Dustiness.
By the way, I didn’t know Darkness-san is a daughter of the Dustiness house! Sorry for my impudence in the past.
No, I hope Wiz can treat me just like before. I’ll feel better that way.
Is that so? If Darkness-san insists…
That should be the reaction of normal people… I’m relieved after seeing Wiz’s attitude. This bunch has been so mean to me…
You’re such a troublesome girl. Make it clear whether you want us to treat you like a noble or a commoner! – Eh, if you want us to treat you like a lady, then change your temper, crude language, and stubborn nature.
I’m not troublesome! And Kazuma has no right to say my language is crude! You’re younger than me, right? Not just me, you’re rude to everyone…!
That’s because I treat you–Darkness–as a comrade. That’s right. In my heart, you’re not the aristocrat lady Lalatina who’s older than me, but the dependable crusader Darkness.
… Is… Is that so. That, that’s great…
So gullible.
Very gullible.
Too gullible.
E-Everyone!
……?
Anyway, we’ve been walking for quite some time. Aren’t there wild beasts living here? Um, will that manager who entered before us be okay? Isn’t he an old man?
Really, Kazuma? Why are you saying something that’ll raise a flag?
I-I didn’t, stupid! I just thought about that suddenly…!
Stop fighting and let’s see what’s happening!
How… How can this be…?
This… Could it be a rookie killer…?
This rookie killer isn’t the one we met yesterday. Was it defeated by a veteran adventurer? Although Wiz defeated one easily…
That hot spring grandpa’s really strong! Let’s meet up with him so he can protect us!
There are no grandpas in this world that can take out a rookie killer alone! This has to be the work of some inhuman monster!
W-What? Didn’t the butcher shop grandpa in Axel hunt toads and fire drakes alone?! A grandpa that can take out a rookie killer might exist too!
Don’t compare the old people in this world with the weirdos in that town! Just look at how that rookie killer died, there are too many suspicious points!
In short, we can’t let our guard down. That grandpa isn’t that simple.
The grandpa chef in Axel turned a ferocious brutal alligator into a main dish too…
Hey Wiz, aren’t you a lich? Don’t you have any convenient lich magic to let us fly straight to the top?
Aqua-sama, liches aren’t all powerful. I did develop a few spells, but they’re all offensive oriented…
Ho, to develop spells on your own, that’s impressive. Don’t tell me they’re stronger than Explosion.
Eh… I’m on edge because I heard there were monsters, but we didn’t meet any… Why’s that so…?
Hey, all of you! Wait, slow down! If we suddenly meet… The enemy… And are… Out of breath… How… Can we fight?
… I knew Kazuma’s stats were bad, but I didn’t know it was this terrible.
Anyway, what’s Kazuma’s stamina? Don’t tell me it’s the same level as an Archwizard like me?
… How should I put this? Kazuma has the lowest level here. Don’t worry, just train up from now on and your stats will grow.
Hey, you mean my stats are really on the same level as you, right?!
Let’s take a break! We walked quite some distance, but there’s no sign of the grandpa. Instead of dashing ahead at full speed, we should conserve our energy.
Hey, don’t tell me my stats are lower than yours! Is my strength and stamina really lower than yours?!
Hey, the hot spring water’s completely black!
? This is poison! I’m absolutely sure!
It burns! Wahhh, it’s scalding! It’s scalding my hand!
You idiot! Why are you putting your hand directly into the hot spring source? Pull your hand out!
But, but! It burns!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Phew… Thanks Wiz, and Kazuma… I’ll be thanking you a tiny bit too.
Only a tiny bit?
That’ll do… But, I can’t purify the water in the pipes. It’ll take some time before this hot spring can be used again… Heal!
… Hmm? So, it’s that guy after all.
What’s the matter? Why are you suddenly stopping?
Ahhh, I can see someone there. What’s he doing there? Is there a hot spring source there too?
Probably. Look, that pipe is linked there… Wait, that guy’s…!
What are all of you doing here? This place is off limits to all except the manager, so how did you get here?
Hey, are you still playing dumb? How dare you destroy the hot springs in this city! I’ll purge you!
Destroy the hot springs? I’m the manager of the hot springs, okay? What are you saying…?
It’s useless to play dumb, okay? And what are you doing here? It’s too troublesome to poison the hot springs one at a time, so you’re going right for the source? The uproar of polluted water gushing out was probably your way of confirming that the source was actually linked to this city, right?
We saw that all the hot springs had been contaminated on our way here. Megumin already asked, so can you tell us what you’re doing here? I’m Dustiness ford Lalatina, with my authority as a noble, I would like you to come with us.
I already said I don’t know what you’re talking about. Do you want to search the things I have with me? You’ll never find anything poisonous… With me…?
Hmm? Who’s that…? I think I’ve seen you somewhere…
An-Anyway, I’m here to investigate the reason behind the pollution, um…
Ahhh! It’s Hans-san! Hans-san, right?!
Who, who’s Hans? I’m the manager of the hot springs in this city…
Hans-san! Long time no see! It’s me, Wiz! The lich!
Lich… You mean those dangerous undead monsters, liches, right? I don’t know what you’re all saying… An-Anyway, I don’t have any means of poisoning, and you have no proof…
Ah, speaking of poison… I recall that Hans-san’s a deadly poison slime variant type! Did Hans-san release his poison into the source?!
Hans-san! Why are you ignoring me? It’s me, Wiz! Hans-san, you can shapeshift too, right? You must’ve changed into the form of the grandpa manager to gain entry, right? Hans-san, hey, Hans-san?
Can… Can you calm down, I don’t know you…! Stop, don’t shake me, please!
Did you really forget about me? I’m Wiz, back when we were in the Demon King castle we–
Ahhh! I just remembered I have something urgent to do! I found out the reason behind the contamination after the investigation! I must rush back to the city… Farewell everyone… Can you let me through?
Where are you going Hans?
You shall not pass, Hans!
You think such an excuse will work, Hans?!
Stop struggling and come clean, Hans.
Don’t keep calling me Hans, Hans, you bunch of worms! What’s Wiz doing here?! Didn’t you say you’ll open a small shop after leaving the Demon King’s castle? Stop fooling around in the hot spring city and go back to work!
How, how mean! I did work hard! For some reason the harder I work, the more losses I make. But I’m still working hard every day!
Sigh… Why did it turn out this way? I spent years to investigate this city, and only decided on this course of action after everything was in place… Wiz, I remember that you don’t provide help to the Demon King’s army in any form aside from the maintenance of the Demon King’s castle barrier. However, you shouldn’t be working against me. We shouldn’t disrupt each other. So, why are you in my way?
Eh? I-I got in Hans-san’s way? I only greeted Hans-san since we haven’t met in a long time!
That was enough to disrupt my work! Thanks to you my identity has been exposed!
What are you going to do, Wiz? Fight me? Or let me through?
How could I do that…? Hans-san is my friend. Um, I’ll be troubled if you destroy the hot springs… Can’t we resolve this through discussion?
Hahaha! The way you think is just like before! You’re a lich, but you’re so naive! When you were an Archwizard, killing us off left and right, you never thought about saying ‘resolve through discussion’, right?
Ugh… Back, back then, I was still immature…
Hey, sorry for interrupting your reunion… You’re Hans, right? I’m Satou Kazuma, the one who directed the battles against the Demon King’s general Beldia and the Mobile Fortress Destroyer. Just recently, I even defeated the devil of foresight, Vanir.
What? A man who looks as terribly weak as you?… Even your equipment’s so bad that I don’t even want to look at you, and you defeated Beldia and Vanir?
How mean of you to say I’m terribly weak. I might look this way, but I’m a man who walked the thin line between life and death several times.
Well, he did die several times.
I knew from the start that you’re a minion of the Demon King’s army. Do you still remember me? Several days ago, we met in the bath of a certain hotel, right?
…? Ah! You’re that man with the lecherous gaze!
I heard you talking back then about destroying the Axis Cult or something! I also knew you were wary of me in the hot spring; I only stared at that big breasted big sister to make you lower your guard!
Hey, you didn’t say anything because you didn’t want to be dragged into a troublesome incident, and yet you’re shamelessly boasting about it.
To not back down while facing me. I see, so you’re quite capable.
Just surrender! Wiz, he and you were ex-colleagues, right? I don’t think you would want to fight him, so back down for now; I’ll go.
K-Kazuma-san? I might be overthinking it, but… Will you be fine? Um, Hans-san is…!
… Seems like all of you really want to fight. Good! It’s been a long time since any adventurers dared to challenge me! No matter who it was, they would cower before me and beg for mercy after learning my true nature. You have guts to fight me head on!
I’m Hans! A general of the Demon King’s army, a variant type deadly poison slime!
… What did you just say?
Kazuma-san! Even among the Generals of the Demon King’s army, Hans is a monster with higher than average bounty! He’s very strong, so be careful…!
Hey, Darkness, slimes are weak monsters, right? They’re just small fries, right?
Slimes are weak monsters? Where did you hear that nonsense from? Leaving small ones aside, slimes above a certain size are powerful adversaries. Firstly, physical attacks are useless. Their magic defense is high too. They eat anything, so it’s over if they stick on to you. They can seep through the gaps in your armor, touch your skin. and dissolve you with digestive fluids. They can also block your mouth and suffocate you to death.
Don’t touch the deadly poison slime, Kazuma! It has poison potent enough to contaminate the entire city! It can harm so many people even after it’s diluted; you’ll die instantly if you touch it!
… In-Instant death?
No problem, Kazuma! With me around, it’s fine even if you die! But don’t get swallowed whole! If you do, your entire body will dissolve, then it won’t matter how powerful my resurrection spell is!
Now, come at me, brave adventurers! I’ll make you re-… gret…?
Wahhh, Kazuma! Wait! Wait!
Hurry up idiot! Or I’ll leave you behind!
Darkness, run quick! This is bad, we’ll die! Don’t think too much, just run!
Ahhh… The slime… The slime will…!
Ka-Kazuma-san, you kept panting while climbing the hill, but you’re fast when running away…!
Are you mocking me, human? After saying all that before me, you still ran away in the end? You’re not living your life correctly! You’re an adventurer after all, don’t you feel shame?!
Of course, I’m an Adventurer! The weakest job of all, Adventurer! How can I fight a general of the Demon’s King army head on?
What, weakest job? You even…! … What?
You’re an Adventurer? The weakest job, Adventurer? Not the general term adventurer, but the job name like Archwizard and Archpriest… Adventurer?
Yes, that’s right; what’s the problem?
I’ll let you off this time. Scram, small fry!
…Phew, it’s finally over.
It’s not over! Hey, he’s going back to destroy the hot spring source!
Then tell me how we can beat that guy. Wiz will feel bad if we ask her to go. I don’t know if Darkness can handle his poison. We can only ask Megumin to do a sneak Explosion attack from range.
Um… If you cast Explosion on Hans-san, his body will scatter and pollute this whole place. Slimes have high resistance against magic; if you don’t get it all, it’ll be hard to destroy him…
I’m not exaggerating, we really can’t do anything this time. If physical attacks were effective, I was planning to try out my new sword.
We’ll postpone the debut of Chunchunmaru to the next volume. But if we leave him be, the hot springs will be in danger. Then, a Demon King’s General will get his way.
Don’t call my sword by that weird name, I’ll never call it by that name…Sigh, what a pain. Hey, Aqua, shall we give up on this hot spring? We can develop other means of business in the future. Honestly, there’s no meaning in the existence of the Axis Cult, right?
I got it… Hey! I’ll go and purify that slime!
That guy, didn’t he think about destroying the pipes directly?!
The pipes seem to be made of magic metal, and aren’t easy to break. It’s the financial lifeline of this city, after all, so they spared no expense.
Hey! Can you be more serious about this? It’ll be bad if this goes on! If the last remaining water source gets polluted, it’ll be a long time before the hot springs will be available in this city again! The Axis Cult in this city will disband!
Isn’t that a good thing?
Waaahhhh!
Wait… Ev-Everyone! Stop joking with Aqua-sama! The important thing right now is…
What, are you all here again? No matter, there’s only one source left; the deed will be done once I contaminate it. Finally! I can finally destroy this damn city!
Hey, how long have you been staying in this city?… Ah, by the way, you changed your form into that of the hot spring manager to get in, right? Where’s the real manager? He should be a blonde grandpa, he…
I ate him.
What, what did you say?
I said, I ate him. I’m a slime, isn’t eating an instinct? Anyway, my shape shifting ability only works if I devour–
Cursed Crystal Prison.
? Ahhh?
My condition for staying neutral–not interfering with the Demon King’s army–is ‘the guarantee that, adventurers and knights aside, the Demon King’s army won’t harm civilians who are non-combatants’, right?
Wiz, stop! Undo your spell! Wiz!
It’s inevitable for adventurers to lose their lives in battle. They take the lives of monsters every day; that’s their livelihood. They must’ve made the resolve of being killed by monsters. It’s the same for knights; their salary is paid by the people, and in exchange, they must protect the citizens. It couldn’t be helped if they had to sacrifice their very lives…
Wiz! You really want to fight me? If we go at it for real, this area will be contaminated…!
But, the hot spring manager grandpa was innocent.
Wiz! Sorry, but I don’t plan to fight you! Let me finish my chores and leave!
Kazuma! That slime’s fast! Shouldn’t slimes be those soft, cute gooey monsters that move slowly?!
Hans-san, I won’t let you destroy the hot spring! Cursed Crystal Prison!
!! Shit, I don’t match up well against you!
I still have this ace in the hole! You’re as naive as you were in the past, Wiz!
Ahhh?
Snipe!
What?
Aqua, use that magic that improves luck, the one you used during rock-paper-scissors!
Eh? O, okay!
Blessing!
Snipe!
What, what’s this? Are you kidding me? What terrifying accuracy is this?
Don’t look down on this man’s luck! His stats might be weaker than a mage, but he’s survived fights with powerful foes thanks to his strong luck!
Hey, are you praising or mocking me?!
Kazuma, shoot it down, shoot it down now!
Leave it to…! … Ah.
Huh? What is it, Kazuma?
Eh?
… I ran out of arrows.
– Wah, wahhh!
Aqua-sama, don’t do it! A part of Hans-san’s body fell into the hot spring! This is on a different level from the contamination earlier!
Ahhh, it hurts, hot! Heal! Heal! Wiz, help me, the pipe of the last water source is going to be contaminated!
A, Aqua-sama! … Light of Saber!!
Kazuma, Ka, Kazuma…!
This…! What a cute slime! Such a pity! If it wasn’t poisonous, I would bring it home as a pet!
That’s too big–!
Oh no, Hans is getting serious! Wiz, take care of that guy! Use that freezing spell from earlier! End this battle with that spell!
That spell isn’t big enough to cover Hans-san! He’s too large now! If I don’t drain some mana from someone…!!
Megumin! Now’s your time to be the sacrifice! My mana isn’t enough, and draining Aqua’s mana will give Wiz unhealthy side effects!
Me? No, no, don’t wanna! I would rather blow that guy up with Explosion!
Don’t do that! You’ll pollute the entire hill!
What are you doing? Why are you taking your armor off…?
If the opponent’s a slime, armor is useless. I’ll give them an opening, so I’m better off without it.
And I like this armor. You repaired it for me, so it’ll hurt me to see it melted or destroyed.
Hey why are you stripping? Run!
Wahhh! Kazuma! Kazuma-sama, help, ahhh!
What are you doing, moron? Don’t bother with that now and run!
But, but! If I don’t defend this place, my believers will…!
Kazuma, what should we do? You always have dirty tricks up your sleeves! Hurry up and deal with this!
Why, you…! What do you mean by dirty tricks? Damn it, I’ll come up with something! So, you just do your thing!
Do, do my thing?
The only thing you can do! Deal the final blow to the General! Prepare your spell and standby near that guy!
Aqua-sama, even if I exhaust all my mana, I won’t be able to freeze Hans-san at his current size! Let’s withdraw! Everyone in the Axis Cult wouldn’t want Aqua-sama to be hurt too!
No! If I don’t step up, who’ll protect my cultists? If I can’t even protect the homes of my devotees, then what would be the point of my existence? Also, cast some Freeze for me!
Darkness, bring those things beside your feet to me!
? Those things? – The specialty gifts?
Ah! What are you doing, such a waste! You’ll receive retribution for wasting food, Ka… Zuma…
No, you can’t Kazuma! I’m planning to give these to my dear father and the servants…!
You can buy gifts anytime! I’ll shop together with you! Stop being depressed and run!
Wiz, after blowing Hans into pieces, can you freeze it?
If Hans-san is about half his current size, I should just barely manage with my remaining mana…
Aqua, Wiz will freeze Hans when he blows into pieces; can you purify the hot spring alone?
I-I can! This is an emergency! I’ll show you my true ability!
I just need to protect everyone from getting hurt by Hans when it explodes, right?
Yes, I’m counting on you.
Kazuma, how long do I have to wait? I’m ready to deal an elegant blow!
When I say go, Wiz will drain my mana away–just don’t let me die.
Eh?
… Well then, do it, Megumin– Go!
Leave it to me! Eat my huge explosive magic! Explosion–!!
Uuuu… I-I worked so hard…! I-I really gave it my all… But…!!
How should I put this…? For once, I actually feel sorry for Aqua…
… I wonder if dear father and the servants will like this…
… Don’t you know there’s such a thing called moderation?
It can’t be helped, I thought the water source would be contaminated if I didn’t give it my all…! Wahhh, I worked so hard! This is too mean, ahhh!
Hey, she’s going to disappear again! She’s disappearing!
Darkness, share your energy with her! Transfer some of it to Wiz, quick!
I-I understand! Come, Kazuma, take it!
I only tried to cleanse the hot springs with all of my powers! Why are they so angry?
Listen to me! Both of you, listen to me! Please, just hear me out!
What is it? The carriage’s already shaking, can you not shake me even more?!
Go on, I don’t mind listening.
The reason this incident turned out this way is because my powers are too strong. Even the clumsy Darkness and screwy head Megumin… That hurts! Lis-Listen to me to the end! The two of them must realize my true identity now, right?
It’s about time for you to believe that I’m a real goddess, right?
… Kazuma, let’s go to a more effective hot spring next time.
That’s right, a hot spring that can heal mental problems.
Why don’t you believe me?
– That concludes the report. The crisis has been resolved.
Purifying the hot springs of an entire city by herself. On top of that, the toxin from the Demon King’s general Hans and pieces of his body was all cleansed away–
To cleanse the remnants of the Demon King’s general… a large group of exceptional Archpriests would require several months to accomplish that. But–
That’s right, and the appearance of that great person…
Blue hair; blue eyes; wearing a hagoromo with a dignified and beautiful appearance.
What should we do next? Should we announce this to the cultists in the city…
Of course, we will. However, we’ll need to inform them in private. That great person might visit this city to play again. When the time comes, we need to tell them not to behave too respectfully, and not talk to her too casually… Also, what about the water source that’s been purified?
Yes, hot spring water doesn’t gush out anymore, but…
If I’m not wrong, the water can now heal wounds, and is very effective against undead monsters?
Yes, the holy water’s very strong too… Simply put, instead of operating a hot spring, the profits from selling this holy water would be higher.
… Speaking of which, we seemed to have burdened that great person with heavy debts…
How about this. We’ll send an envoy to Axel, and return the compensation money in some sort of way…
… Good point, let’s do that then. By right, we should thank her for saving the city and apologize for burdening her with debts…
Well then, I’ll do as you asked, Zesta-sama–
Yes, please do.
I offer you my most sincere thanks on behalf of the cult, Aqua-sama–!
Home–!
Can’t you say ‘I’m home’ properly?
What’s the matter? Why the weird face? Is this a new game?
I’m just imitating you. Looks just like you, right?
Really, we just came back, can’t you two give it a rest? Have some tea and cool down, both of you.
Phew, this place makes me feel the most at ease–although it isn’t adequate for the one who proposed the trip to say that.
Hey Megumin, that’s my special holy seat!
If you want it, let’s decide it with a game.
Hey, Megumin, you’re using your Archwizard too cunningly. Here, take my useless Crusader, let’s trade.
Tactically speaking, I don’t need the Crusader. I reject the trade. It’s your turn, Aqua.
Hey, um, well, I know you two are talking about the game, but…
Megumin! Hey, is Megumin here? And, is Kazuma-san here too?
Here, here! Is that Yunyun? What’s the matter, something troublesome? Be it a Demon King’s general or a bounty target, just tell me what’s bothering you.
Um, um… This is very sudden… But…
What’s the matter Yunyun? Looking for me?
I…! I…!! I want to have Kazuma-san’s children!!
So cool…
Hey, even if it’s a so called herbivorous Rookie Killer, it’s still a powerful monster. Come on, it’s dangerous here, so let’s go back.
Do you not understand how cool it is, Kazuma? That sleek body, those huge fangs that look like they could end a creature in a single blow, and those bright red eyes shining from beneath his black fur… Just everything about it is so cool!
Well, yeah, large cats are cool and all, but some noble has already decided to buy this Rookie Killer. We can’t afford the compensation if anything were to happen to him.
Just a while longer, I’ll go back after just a little while longer… This one seems to really like eating wolfberries. Yeah, I like eating them too.
Kazuma, I want to set the Rookie Killer and Chomusuke together.
… I know they are both felines, but have you really thought this through? At least consider the difference in size… Hey, stop! Don’t shove Chomusuke through the bars! Do you want her to become a snack?
… Seems like it failed. Ah, and here I wanted them to create a cool child together…
Come on, you should respect their choice.
I want to give him an awesome sounding name.
Don’t do that. Seriously, I’m begging you, don’t.
–I made an outfit to bring out Chomusuke’s cuteness today. Do you think the Rookie Killer will like her better now?
What are you doing? I feel sorry for Chomusuke… Though I guess the cat quite likes it…
Kazuma, Kazuma, I think there’s something wrong with that Rookie Killer as of late. How do I put it, It feels like it’s weaker than usual.
… Yeah, it does seem more lethargic. And the way it sleeps is a little odd.
His body has probably become weak after being locked up in that cage for so long.
– So this is the herbivorous Rookie Killer…  What the- It’s not dead, is it?!
It isn’t dead. Can’t you see it’s ears moving?
Who are you? Are you the adventurer who caught this beast?
No, I’m only here to visit.
It might not make it back to my residence like this… Ah well, if it ends up dying, I suppose I’ll just stuff it.
… How long do you intend on following us for? Anyway, we’re leaving, so hurry up and make way.
… Hey, how long would it take for you people to load it onto the carriage? You know what, nevermind, we brought the specially made collar with us, yes? Just put it on its neck and take it out of the cage. If it’s this weak, a collar and rope would be enough to control it. It’d be faster this way. I won’t need to spend money to buy the cage too.
Right, the collar and rope are both attached now… Say, are you sure this thing is still alive? It’s not moving at all. Hey, just drag him out of the cage!
Aaah! Th-This guy isn’t weak at all! Help me! Hey, Crimson Demon girl! You can use advanced magic, right? Hurry up and kill this thing!
Hurry up! What are you waiting for, strike it down already!
My magic is quite special. If I unleash it at this range, it might hurt you…
Don’t worry about that, hurry up and blast it! That thing tried to kill me, so hurry up and slay it already!
Explosion—-！
… It left… Yeah, Rookie Killers are cunning monsters with high intelligence. I almost forgot about that…
… Say, there’s a reason other than mana exhaustion that you aren’t raising your head, right?
Shut up! You are as tactless as usual, Kazuma! Forget it, hurry up and carry me home!
Explosion–!
How, how many points did I get…?
From the volume of the sound and destructive power… 85 points!
Urghh! As expected of Kazuma, I would’ve given that Explosion the same score. Kazuma’s progressing really fast…!
Fufu, after accompanying you every day, my judgement’s also improved. It’s fine to address me as the ‘Explosion connoisseur’. Here, let me give you a piggyback.
Ughh…
Of course not. I’m already an excellent mage! How dare you complain after getting me?
I’ll get one hundred points next time…!
Hey Megumin, can you hold on and not make your move yet? If you let me take back my move, I’ll give you this weirdly shaped rock I found in a hot spring  from Alcanretia.
… What did you say?
I-I said, ‘I want to have Kazuma-san’s children’!
… I want the first child to be a girl.
No, no, you can’t, the first born must be a boy!
No, hold on you two, why are you talking about boys and girls? How did the conversation progress to such a state? And Yunyun, why are you saying such nonsense? Do you know what you’re saying?
I-I agree with Megumin. You’re Yunyun, right? I don’t know what happened between you and Kazuma, but don’t be rash! Do you know what kind of man this thing is?
Hmm? Please wait a moment! Yes, this is it! If I place the originally useless Crusader here…?
Wake up! Or rather, you’ll lose sight of things if you’re too rash! Please tell me in detail exactly what’s happening!
Be-Because!! If I don’t have Kazuma’s children, the world will–! The Demon King will…!
Is that so, the world will… Don’t worry, everyone, you don’t need to say anymore. Leave the world and the Demon King to me. I’ll have a baby with Yunyun, defeat the Demon King and the world will be saved, right? How can I reject the request of someone in need?
Why, you! And you were always so resistant when I asked you to take on quests!
That’s right! You never listened to others, so why are you so eager at a time like this? And why don’t you have any doubts about this sudden turn of events?
Shut up! What are you two going on about just now? This is a matter between the two of us, right? Those not involved shjust shut up! It’s a rare chance for me to be so popular, so don’t get in my way!
This man’s twisting the facts and blaming us! And how am I not involved, my friend’s going to be abducted by a weirdo, of course I have to sound out!
After all, I’ve been meeting pretty girls and beautiful women all this while! it’s strange that there aren’t any developments at all! Aren’t we the heroes who defeated multiple generals of the Demon King’s army? Didn’t we resolve many incidents? It wouldn’t be weird for pretty girls who admire me or adventurers who want my signature to pop up!! Hey Darkness, you’re sort of a noble, so at least give me a medal in recognition of my merits!
Y-You! Don’t say that out loud, even if that’s how you feel! All your hard-earned achievements will be ruined if you say it out like that!
Please, please, calm down! Sorry, it’s all my fault, so please calm down!
I heard that people will normally get married between sixteen to twenty years old in this country, but it’s fine to do so from fourteen! Yunyun and Megumin are classmates, so she’s fourteen, right? Then there’s no problem! Wonderful, simply wonderful! A blissful life not bound by laws! The joy of not being a lolicon! This is the first time I’ve liked this world!! And what’s with the lot of you? Do you all have a thing for me? Jealous because I’m going to date Yunyun? Then just spit it out, you bunch of tsunderes!
This guy! Darkness, let’s get him! Let him taste death once more!
Yes, watch me beat up this useless bum who’s only good at yapping!
Oh? Oh? What, you want to fight? You girls never learn, huh! I can attack by using Drain Touch, and touching your body is proper self-defense! No matter where I grab, it won’t be sexual harassment!
Hey, it’s Megumin’s turn to move. Look here, this is a move I’m confident of. Hurry up!
Explosion!
Waaahhhh!!
Uhh… Uhh… I should’ve banned the Explosion rule…
Despite my appearances, I’ve been training everyday with the goal of being the strongest mage. Weak scum like Kazuma will be defeated easily even if I don’t use magic!
Hey, even I’ll take offence from that. What makes me dangerous is how I defeated so many powerful foes despite my low stats. I’ll never lose against a dumb explosion mage who can only use one spell. The muscle-headed crusader isn’t even worth mentioning.
Muscle-headed crusader?
Megumin, listen to me! The home of the Crimson Demons… The Crimson Demon village is going to disappear!!
Please excuse our mediocre tea and hospitality.
No, it’s fine, thank you very much.
… Well then, what’s going on? The Crimson Demon village disappearing is bad news. Can you explain it in detail?
… This is the letter sent by Yunyun’s father, the village chief, huh?
Hold on, isn’t there another Crimson Demon here?
Ignore that for now, look behind! There’s another page!
Like I said, why is Yunyun the only survivor? What happened to me?
No, ignore that for now! Continue reading!
… As the only survivor of the village, Yunyun hid her goal of defeating the Demon King in her heart and focused on training. Sometime later, she’ll meet a certain man in the city of beginners. Unreliable and powerless, that man would be her future spouse.
… Why are you looking at me? Is the unreliable and powerless man referring to me? And Yunyun, you came here based on just that?
I’m going to read on, okay?
?
Our, our child will defeat the…?
Wait, wait! What’s with this nonsense? Hey Kazuma, someone as paranoid as you wouldn’t believe in something as vague as divination, right?
Hey, that would be troubling! It would be troubling for me!!
I don’t want it to be so troublesome, so can you hurry up and defeat the Demon King? It’ll take too long for Kazuma’s kid to grow up! Hey, at what age can one be considered a youth? Is three years okay? If not, let’s pretend that divination doesn’t exist!
The Crimson Demon village has powerful oracles! Which means that divination is…!
I understand, leave it to me. This is for the sake of the world, it can’t be helped.
Why you, you… Is this fine? You’re always wishy washy, so why did you pick today to be so decisive?
… On this page, the last part says, ‘Legend of the Crimson Demon Hero, Chapter 1, Author: Arue.’
?
Let me see. Oh, the handwriting is different from the first page. The first page is written by Yunyun’s father. The second one has the postscript ‘postage is too expensive, so I asked the village chief to send it together with his. I’ll send chapter 2 over when I finish it’…
Ahhh–!
Waaahhhh, that’s too much! Arue, that idiot, ahhh!!
Hey, explain to me what’s happening! Who’s Arue? What about our children? What should I do? Should I strip here or in the bedroom?
You can wash up, go to your room, and sleep… Arue’s my classmate from the Crimson Demon village. How should I put it; she’s a weird girl aiming to be an author…?
Oh, so it’s just a story… Hmm? Wait, what about the first letter?
The contents of this one should be true. The Crimson Demons have been an eyesore to the Demon King’s army for the longest time. This day was bound to come sooner or later anyway. They’re probably getting serious about attacking the Crimson Demon village.
Hey, wait, wait, what about my tender heart? Don’t mess with me! I was prepared to take my pants off and now you tell me this? What about Yunyun? Yunyun and I will become sweet lovers, right?
It won’t happen. You’re in the way, just step aside and play with Aqua… By the way, Megumin, why are you so calm? Aren’t you worried about your family and classmates? Your home village’s in danger, right?
That, that’s right. Now’s not the time to be crying! Hey Megumin, what should we do? I think it’s true that our village’s being attacked! What should  we do?
We’re the Crimson Demons that even the Demon King fears, right? I don’t think the people in the village will helplessly await their demise. Also, if Yunyun, the daughter of the village chief, is here, the bloodline of the Crimson Demons won’t be broken no matter what happens to the village. So, I think it would be better to think about it this way–everyone in the village will live on in our hearts–
Megumin, you cold-hearted girl! Why do you act so heartless every time?
Um… Sorry for saying something weird so suddenly. How, how should I put this… Kazuma-san is the only man I know…
Oh, right. It’s fine. Anyway, what are you going to do? Isn’t your home village in danger?
Yes, I’ll prepare to leave for the Crimson Demon village now. After all, it’s my home village; my f-f-friends are there.
Well then, sorry for bothering you, everyone! Um, you too Megumin. Goodbye…
… Kazuma, will it be fine to let that girl go alone? I thought you would be driven by your lust and try to act cool by saying, ‘I’ll go with you’.
Didn’t she say a General of the Demon King’s army is attacking? Even if I went along, I would just get in the way. It’s dangerous and scary, and I’m tired after my journey back… But Megumin, if you’re worried about that kid, you can tag along with her, you know?
Th-this guy; you were just boasting about being a hero who took out the Demon King’s Generals! And why would I be worried about Yunyun? She’s my rival, okay? Something like an enemy to me.
Hey, she might be saying that, but didn’t she look really uneasy all this while?
Don’t be so mean, Kazuma… But I know Megumin’s not being honest. Why don’t you give her a way out of this?
Hey Aqua, say something… Ah…
Huu…
Hey Kazuma, is it really fine leaving her alone like this? Um, isn’t that Yunyun girl Megumin’s friend? I heard that she’s strong… But still…
It’ll be fine. She’s a real Crimson Demon and can use advanced magic. Or rather, she’ll be safer going alone instead of having us tagging along. After all, we have someone deeply loved by the undead in our team.
Please come in.
What are you doing here so late at night? Did Yunyun’s words ignite your competitive spirit, and you’re now here for a night raid?
Watch it, I’ll blow you away! Your verbal sexual harassment has been really going strong ever since I turned fourteen!
Well, you know. I don’t really care what happens to Yunyun, but actually, I have a sister much younger than me back home.
That’s why, even though Yunyun has nothing to do with me, I’m still worried about my sister… Why, why are you laughing so deviously?
Anyway, the situation is like this. This tsundere says she wants to go back to her home village, and I feel that going to the Crimson Demon village to play is a neat idea too.
Who’s a tsundere? Didn’t I say that I was worried about my little sister…?
The village seems to be at war with the Demon King’s army, so first we’ll watch the situation in the village from a distance. If it’s as dangerous as the letter suggested, we’ll go home immediately. If we discover any Demon King’s army forces, we’ll also go home. We have to do our best to avoid fights with monsters too!
That battle plan’s so depraved, as expected of Kazuma! But it’s fine. Even though we just returned from a trip… I’ll use my power to save the people in Megumin’s home village!
Crimson Demon village, huh? That’s a haven for powerful monsters. And there’ll be hordes of Demon King’s army forces attacking…! Ah, what if we get overwhelmed by their numbers and become their prisoners? Hey Kazuma, if that happens, don’t worry about me, just take care of yourselves!
Don’t worry, I’ll be very happy to dump you there. Please don’t come back.
Hey Kazuma, where are we going? Aren’t we going to the Crimson Demon village with that Yunyun kid?
Yunyun left yesterday afternoon in a coach. We can’t catch up even if we go now. And I’ve had enough of traveling by coach. Also, there’s somewhere I want to go.
… Ugh. So, this is the place you want to go…? Um, I’m a Crusader who worships Eris-sama, so I don’t really want to be here… After all, there’s–
Welcome! The man who didn’t raise much in levels despite having a job that’s easy to level; the little girl who wasn’t of much use aside from relying on the power of her family name; the delinquent priestess emitting an annoying light; as well as the useless Crimson Demon who’s a master of a useless spell! Thou came at the right time!
This fellow here…!
Use-, useless Crimson Demon…?
Please, come in.
What do you mean by ‘coming at the right time’? Did you import weird merchandise again? I’ll make this clear now, I won’t buy anything from this shop.
Don’t say that! Moi has no intentions of peddling garbage every time, this shall definitely suit your taste.
…? What’s this?
This is a magic item to repel the undead. Just by opening the cover, holy air that’ll keep the undead away will be emitted continuously, and will last for half a day. Well, you have a strange team member that attracts the undead, correct? You suffered much in thy previous journey because of that, right? With this, you would be able to sleep peacefully even if you camp outside!
Hey, that ‘weird teammate’ isn’t referring to me, right?
Well, what are its demerits? There’s definitely something wrong with it, right?
There are none. The only bad thing about this is the high price and one-time usage. But it’s very effective! So effective that the clumsy shop owner couldn’t come out of the shop after accidentally opening the box, and has been crying all this while.
No, close the box and ventilate the place! So, that noise is Wiz crying? And Wiz too, why did she buy this…? But it really is convenient, so give me one. I’ll need it soon anyway.
That’ll be one million eris! Thank thee for thy patronage!
So expensive?! At that price, I would rather fight with the zombies!
Oh, this is nothing, dear customer. After all, customer, you are going to be a very wealthy man soon! All the intellectual property rights you own as of now are to be sold to moi for three hundred million eris! Will this contract suffice?
Three hundred million eris…? If you give such a huge amount to this man, he’ll really become a bum who lazes around all day! However, that sounds good too…
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san. I want a pool in the mansion.
I want a mana freshener that’s said to improve mana recovery rate.
Oh, you zombies attracted to the smell of money. A pool and mana freshener both sound expensive, so I won’t even consider it right now. Rather than that, go pick out some items we might need for this trip.
– Well then, just deduct the cost for this undead repellent magic item from the three hundred million eris. It’ll be some time before you can raise the three hundred million, right?
Yes. Moi must apologize; after all, the loser shop owner who imported unnecessary junk increased our expenditure. Finances were already short before that. But moi will procure a large sum of money next week. Moi has gathered investors in this town.
By the way, I have some business with Wiz. Can you please get her for me?
Yo, Wiz, are you feeling well? Sorry for bothering you again today. I didn’t come here to buy stuff, but to seek your help.
…? Seek my help?
– I see. So, I just need to send everyone to Alcanretia with teleport, right?
Um, hey Vanir, how effective is this potion that attracts monsters? What’ll happen if you get sprayed by this?
This is meant to be drunk. After drinking this, not just monsters, even the people in town, your family, and your comrades will detest you and attack. This is an excellent product that complements your twisted fetish perfectly. Want one?
… Even my family and friends…? Ugh, it would be troubling if they keep hating me, but if the effect is temporary, I might consider buying…
… Oh, there are potions that increase the effectiveness of a specific spell temporarily. Are there any potions that’ll enhance the power of explosion spells?
Right now, the only spell enhancement potions we have in stock are for Curse Magic and Marsh Magic. The Curse Magic potion will increase the area of effect of your spell, so you yourself will also be rendered immobile if thee use it against an enemy. The same with Marsh Magic, it increases the area of effect and will drown the caster in the marsh too.
Useless products… And what about this doll with such a strong sense of presence?
Those are Vanir dolls, made by embedding fragments of moi mask. A great product that wards off evil spirits out of their fear for moi. This is also the only hot selling product in this shop. It’ll laugh in the middle of the night, but its effects are splendid. There are no evil spirits in your mansion, but there is a spirit there… How about getting one?
Laughing in the middle of the night is just like having an evil spirit in the mansion. And if there are any spirits in the mansion, our Aqua won’t let it off anyway.
Hey, wait, Megumin still doesn’t believe what I said? Didn’t I mention that there’s a spirit of an aristocratic girl living in the mansion? Because she’s a pitiful child, I didn’t purify her and let her roam free!
Yeah right. That spirit will occasionally drink Aqua’s wine, right? I get it, I get it.
Even Darkness? Believe me!!
But, the Crimson Demon village… I went to purchase supplies in that village in the past. I went to visit a famous magic item crafter called Hyoizaburo back then, but he wasn’t home, unfortunately…
Please, please, wait a moment. Did you say Hyoizaburo?… By the way, when did you visit the Crimson Demon village?
I visited about two years ago? Right, right, when I visited the craftsman’s home, there was a cute girl that resembled Megumin-san very much who greeted me…
What’s the matter? Something wrong?
No, it’s nothing… Just that my unnecessary judgement disrupted your business trip…
Don’t touch that, you plague goddess! Every potion you touch turns into water!
What kind of attitude is this? Aren’t customers goddesses? On top of that, I’m a real goddess! Show the appropriate respect for a goddess!
You are thick-skinned enough to say that after destroying moi merchandise , you goddess of poverty? Hey Wiz, moi heard what you were saying! You are sending these bunch away, right? Do it before she destroys all the merchandise in the shop!!
Hey brat!
Since thee purchased an expensive merchandize, moi will gift you this advice. The devil of prophecy warns… At the destination of thy journey, there will be a time when thy comrade will share their doubts and approach thee for advice. That comrade will change her path according to thy words. Thou should consider it carefully and give an advice thy won’t regret.
Well then, I wish you a safe journey…! Teleport!!
Hey, hey Kazuma. Kazuma.
We’re leaving right away, I don’t want anything to do with your religion and cultists anymore.
But why?
Kazuma, I’m not going back home because I’m worried about Yunyun, but for my sister. So, let’s move on. If it’s her, she’ll catch up soon, don’t worry.
It’ll take two days to walk from this city to the village. Many dangerous monsters frequent the road there, so we need to rely on Kazuma’s Enemy Detection skill.
Don’t worry, leave it to me. Didn’t I defeat some mob monsters in the previous journey? I raised a level back then. With the excess skill point, I learned the rogue skill Escape. With this, I can run away at any time.
Hey, isn’t that skill only effective for Kazuma alone? Do you mean you’ll escape by yourself if you detect any enemies?
Kazuma’s job is Adventurer, which levels easily, right? But after such an intense battle with a Demon King’s general , you only raised one level? My level raised to 33 in one go!
Hey, don’t flash your adventurer’s card in front of me or I’ll snatch it and throw it away. It can’t be helped, you can steal the kill on the general and blow tons of mob monsters in one go. On the other hand, my only means of attack is this sword with a weird name and a bow.
… Hmm, someone’s there.
Aren’t you hurt? Hey, are you alright?
My Enemy Detection skill activated. That’s a monster in disguise.
Huh?
Hey Kazuma, I think she’s looking at you with very sad eyes. I feel the urge to cast a healing spell on that child.
Hey Kazuma, she looks like she’s about to cry. Is that really a monster?
Ka-Kazuma, that child’s smiling while doing her best to hold back her tears. She’s waving as if to say goodbye. I really feel like going over to give her a hug.
Ugh…! Even if she’s a monster, ignoring a casualty is…
It’s a type of vegetation monster that won’t deal physical damage, but it’ll stop travelers by stimulating their protective instincts, starve them to death, and enroot them.
I’ll heal your wounds! … Huh? These aren’t wounds. These aren’t bandages either, just something that looks like it.
Hey, what are you thinking Kazuma? Are you going to use this child to earn experience points?
I heard about tranquility girls before. However, we can’t hurt a monster with an appearance of a girl, right? Although Kazuma’s renowned for being an evil bastard, I know Kazuma has a side that cares for his comrades, a kind and gentle side. Kazuma wouldn’t do something like that… You wouldn’t, right…?
… No. If Kazuma decided to exterminate it, then it should be done. I came over because I thought it was injured, but it wasn’t hurt at all. Judging from this, this monster must be a very cunning mimic. If we leave it alone, there’ll be more victims in the future.
…Want kill… Me…?
…Want kill… Me…?
You look painful… Sorry because I live…
Because, I, monster live… Will cause trouble…
Since born, first time, talk with humans…
First, and last time met with you, wonderful… If, another life… Next time, not monster, will be wonderful…
— But I am so glad that Kazuma still has some shreds of humanity in him. I thought you would say ‘become my experience points!’ and murder it, then burn it away with fire magic.
I think there is a need to talk with you about how you normally see me. All of you should know very well that I won’t do something like that, right?
Hey, wait. Isn’t it bad if there is a Tranquility girl on this path?
Your face is the same color as Wiz, what’s the matter? Does your stomach hurt? There’s some trees there, we will keep away so go there and settle it quick.
That’s not it! Hey, you girls go first! I’m going back to the Tranquility girl; I have something to discuss with it!
Huh, wait, wait Kazuma?
Ahh… Damn, why must it be so…? Sorry, I’m sorry! Forgive me! It’s the rule of the lumberjacks which dictates that I must exterminate you upon discovery…!
Because, I, monster live… Will cause trouble…
Since born, first time, talk with humans…
First, and last time met with you, wonderful… If, another life… Next time, not monster, will be wonderful…
Ah… Ahhh… I can’t do it. Damn, I can’t do it!
Ahhh~, failed again. That lumberjack looked quite meaty and would’ve been great fertilizer…
Uwaaahhh… Damn it, no fertilizer’s coming… It’s a bit cloudy, but let’s photosynthesize a little…Sigh– What a pain.
Just now, those words, could you, pretend you, didn’t hear them…?
So, you could speak fluently, and were playing me like a damn fiddle!!!
You looked refreshed, what happened? What did you say to that child? And why did you have to go back anyway?
Look everyone! I raised three levels in one shot! This way, I’ll be of some use after going to Megumin’s place!
Waaahhhh… Waaahhhh! Kazuma, you demon! Evil demon! Compared to you, Vanir’s much cuter!
Ah… Ahhh… Ahhh… It’s all my fault… All because I mocked Kazuma after raising so many levels…! Kazuma laid his hands on that child because I agitated him…? It’s, it’s all because of my arrogance that I did all that…!
It must be painful, right?… You fulfilled the obligations of an adventurer. Sorry, I left such an unpleasant task to you…
… Kazuma, are you really fine with not sleeping? It’s true that from the type of skills you have it would be better for you to be awake, but…
Don’t worry. I have the characteristic of being strong in staying up all night. In the country I was from, staying up all night was nothing to me.
By the way, where did you and Aqua live in the past? I’m curious about your country. From the merchandise you developed, that country seems to have plenty of convenient magic items. I wonder what kind of life you had lived there, too. Just what kind of lifestyle could train up the characteristic of ‘being strong in staying up all night’…
I see… I was a Ranker in my country.
…? Ranker?
If I must explain, it means someone with a high ranking. I was known to my comrades as ‘Kazuma-san who’s only lucky in getting rare drops’, ‘Kazuma-san who’s always online no matter what time I log in’, and so on… Anyway, I had all sorts of nicknames and was trusted by everyone. We raided fortresses, hunted powerful bosses; those were enjoyable times… Staying up all night was a norm. I didn’t eat proper meals, and only slept two hours a day before returning to my quest to hunt monsters…
How, how amazing… Attacking fortresses and hunting bosses…! I see, Kazuma reacts so quickly to any changes in situations because of the experience you accumulated…! How, how amazing…!
It’s hard to believe those words since I know how Kazuma usually is… But why, why do I get the feeling you aren’t lying? Just now, you were brimming with confidence and nostalgia…
… Hey Kazuma, can I explain what MMOs are?
Please don’t do that.
… Um, what’s that amazing way to wake her up you mentioned? Let me make this clear first, you can’t cross that line with comrades, okay? You understand, right?
That’s the kind of creature men are, if you tell them it’s a wall they can’t climb over, they’ll want to scale it… That’s right, the higher the wall in life, the higher the mountain, the more one will want to overcome it. These are the same things.
No, that’s not it! Don’t mix that up with such a positive motivational speech! I’m starting to feel that taking a watch together with Kazuma is really dangerous!
Speaking of which…
The topic we discussed before they slept… you came from a different nation, right?… Um. Kazuma, you never thought of going back?
I can’t go back even if I wanted to. Even if I do, I’ll just live a busy and meaningless life once again. I feel that my current life isn’t too bad. After the trip to the Crimson Demon village is done, I’ll be able to get three hundred million eris from Vanir and be a rich man. After that, I’ll live an interesting and peaceful life with everyone.
Is that so…? I like my life right now too, so this is good. We get into danger often, but everyone will work together to get through it. I’m very satisfied with my fun life right now.
…Zzz…
… Really, it’s all because Kazuma and Megumin were so noisy last night that I didn’t sleep well.
Sorry for the disturbance, but this loli fell asleep mid-way through her watch. Also, when it was your turn for the watch you wouldn’t get up no matter what, so how dare you complain. In the end, Darkness took your watch too.
No, I heard that Megumin was woken up in an amazing way by Kazuma when she dozed off, so I was wondering what would happen to me if I fell asleep mid-way through my shift. My heart was pounding non-stop and I couldn’t sleep…
Ughh… He, he did something really ridiculous to me…
This is really…
Hey, I’ll walk ahead alone, so all of you be prepared to run away at a moment’s notice. Aqua, cast a speed buffing spell on me so they won’t be able to catch me.
You’re all ready to run at any moment, just how thick-skinned are you?
Well, I couldn’t fight the monsters around here head on anyway. The monster names listed in the information column all looked tough. And they won’t come one at a time, so I have to try my best in avoiding battle and adopt the policy of running away.
Well then, all of you keep a distance from me. Remember, don’t stay so far behind that you’ll lose track of me. If anything happens, I’ll give you all a signal. If you see it, run immediately.
I understand, leave it to me.
I understand very well you don’t know hand gestures at all. Darkness, Megumin, I’ll be counting on  both of you.
… Ka… Zuma! Ka…!
Create Earth.
Good day! Hey handsome nii-chan, want to have a good time with me?
I refuse.
Ara, is that so, such a pity. I was hoping you would do it with me willingly.
Since we can communicate, let’s talk about this. Please let me through. If you do that, I’ll share some of my food with you as thanks… What say you?
That sort of thing doesn’t matter. This is the territory of orcs. We won’t let any males passing by go… How interesting, onii-san. For some reason, I sense powerful survival instincts from your seemingly weak body. My intuition has always been on point. Our child will definitely be strong… Come, let’s do something fun.
Ara, those over there… What, all of them are females. I don’t care about them. But for you, let me think… Three days. How about going to my village for three days or so? Hehe, it’s a harem for you there. You’ll learn what heaven in this world is. Well, the men we capture do go to heaven for real!
Wind Breath!
?
… What is it? It would be meaningless for me to walk in front if all of you are so close to me. Keep some distance away from me.
What are you saying, Kazuma? You defeated an orc! This plain is the territory of the orcs. Which means you will be their target until we cross this plain!
Isn’t it good if I’m being targeted? Just why do you think I’m so lightly armored? To attract attention and be the decoy! And I don’t want to see your tragic outcome if you get caught by the orcs.
Oh, right, Kazuma’s an idiot who doesn’t know the common sense of this world. Can’t be helped, let me tell you… Ow, ow, stop! 
… Kazuma, listen. There are no male orcs in the world.
Huh?
Male orcs died out a long time ago. Even when the occasional male orcs are born, they’ll be squeezed dry by the females and die before adulthood. Thanks to that, the orcs crossbreed continuously and gained the excellent genes of various races, becoming monsters that could no longer be considered orcs. Right now, orcs are known for infiltrating the turf of other races, kidnapping the males and bringing them back to their village, making them suffer terribly; the nemesis of men… Also, um, Kazuma, you…
Wait, wait, orcs should be the nemesis of female knights! Driven by their strong libido, they’ll pounce on any woman they see, the males of these orcs…
Are extinct… Kazuma defeated a female orc. All of them want a powerful male with excellent genes. So, they won’t let Kazuma who defeated their comrade go… Look, just like that.
You’re a good man. To think you can knock me out! … I won’t let you go. I’m mesmerized by you, how are you going to make it up for me? I definitely want your child!!
What? Wait…! Waaahhhh!
I want the first child to be a boy!
I want sixty boys and forty girls!
I want to live in a white house overlooking the sea, making love with you everyday!
All right! It’ll be over soon. It’ll be over in no time so close your eyes…!
Save me! Megumin, use that! Use that and finish all of them in one shot!
If I use Explosion at such a close range, we will get dragged in as well! Darkness, stop being depressed and rescue Kazuma…!!
Talk! Let’s talk first!!
I would love to talk erotic things with you! Go on, say it! Tell me all the embarrassing fetishes you have! Huff, huff, huff!
Stop, stop, ahhh! Name! I still don’t know your name yet! This might be my first time! So, let’s start with self-introductions, ahhh! My name’s Satou Kazuma!
I’m Swatinaze, a young and energetic 16 year old orc! Come, let your lower half introduce himself, too! Introduce the son you’re so proud of!
My son’s a little shy! We already exchanged names so let’s call it a day, ahhh! Aqua! Aqua! Save me!
Ka-Kazuma!
Bottomless Swamp!
Yunyun! Isn’t that Yunyun? Ugh, uwahhh!
?
Yunyun! Yunyun! Thank you so much, ahhh!
Hya…! Wait, wait Kazuma-san? It, it’s fine now, it’s fine, so… Don’t cry… Um, my important robe is being stained with snot…
It’s great that you’re fine, Kazuma! … What, what’s the matter Kazuma?
There, there, you must be terrified, Kazuma. It’s fine now, don’t worry. Everyone will protect you.
I’m Yunyun! One of the top mages of the Crimson Demons, an Archwizard that wields Advanced Magic. I’m the one who’ll be the next chief of the Crimson Demons…! To the orcs who built a village near the Crimson Demon village: I’ll spare you on the count that we’re neighbors. Take your comrades with you and go!
Kazuma-san, let’s use this chance to retreat .
With Yunyun around, there’s no need to fear monsters. Really, this is too easy.
Yunyun, once again, thank you. Really, thank you. If I must describe how thankful I am, it’s like–if anyone asks me who I respect the most, I’ll answer ‘Yunyun’ immediately.
Please, please, don’t do that, it’ll look as if you’re mocking me!
By the way, why’s everyone here? Is Megumin coming home because you’re worried about everyone?
Yes, right, it’s my sister! I’m a bit worried about her. After all, she’s always doing reckless things.
Yup, that’s true. She’s a child who can’t use magic, yet she is so eager to fight.
… Why, why’s everyone smiling deviously?
… All of you are beautiful.
What, what is it? Kazuma he, he has always been talking strangely, but it’s worse today!
Calm, calm down! This fellow must have an ulterior motive. We can’t let our guard down around him. We’ll regret it if we become happy about it!
All of you are real beauties.
What’s happening? Someone tell me! Kazuma’s acting weird, what’s going on?
Calm down, Aqua! First, cast a healing spell on Kazuma!
… –!
– Megumin was always the top of the class in magical studies and mana capacity… The villagers all think of her as a genius and had high expectations of her… If they knew Megumin had fallen and became a flawed mage that can only use Explosion…
Hey, don’t call me a ‘flawed mage’. In terms of magical destruction, I’m without a doubt the best of the Crimson Demons, that’s a fact. Please don’t speak ill of the explosion magic I’ve devoted my entire life to.
What’s the use of explosion magic? It’s too powerful, and can’t be used in dungeons or it’ll cause a collapse! Even if it has the longest attack range, it’ll hit the caster and allies if the targets are too near! Even very high-level mages can’t fire it twice in a row, the mana consumption is too great! No matter how you look at it, it’s overkill, right? Explosion is a useless spell and a waste of skill points that no one will bother to learn.
… How dare you, Yunyun. You said something you shouldn’t have said. Something more serious than making fun of my name, the biggest taboo–!
What, what, want to get it on? I’ll accept your challenge. I won’t lose to Megumin anymore!
Kazuma, let me tell you Yunyun’s shameful secret. All Crimson Demons receive a tattoo after birth. The placement of the tattoo is different for everyone, and Yunyun’s tattoo is at…
Shut up, what are you telling Kazuma-san? And why do you know the position of my tattoo? You can’t use Explosion in a place like this, right? It’s easy to subdue Megumin who can’t use magic!
Aqua, give me a buffing spell! I’ll teach this kid a lesson!
D-Despicable! Megumin’s so sly! You’ve always been so sly!
– Hey, this way! I hear human voices from this direction!!
Hey, you two, we’re going to be discovered by the enemy! Keep it down!
It’s all because the bad tempered Megumin raised her voice!
Yunyun has a worse temper than me! You’ve been doing things without regards for the consequences since long ago! See, even Chomusuke doesn’t dare to come out from the hat now!
What did you say?
The two of you shut up! I already told you we’ll be discovered if you talk so loudly! Hey Kazuma, tell them!
Hey, that doesn’t matter, tell me where Yunyun’s tattoo is!
Found them, over there! There’s someone there!
Why, you! You really…!!
Found two Crimson Demons! The rest look like human adventurers! Hey, this way, quick! There are two Crimson Demon kids! This is a chance to earn some merits!
Hmm–? You seem to be pretending to be a low-level devil, how annoying! You can’t even become a proper devil, just a ghoul-like half-devil. What’s with that? What do you want to do? Exorcism magic won’t even work against low-level monsters like you. Isn’t that great news, the guy who can’t even become a devil? Pfft! I don’t have time for half-baked devils like you. After you become a proper devil, I’ll be your opponent. I’ll spare you today, so scram. Go on, shoo!
You want to spare us? Hey, that priestess over there, what did you say? … There are two kids of the Crimson Demons that gave us so much trouble. How can we let you go? Hey, tear them to pieces!
Light of Saber!
S-Surround them! She can’t do anything if we surround and charge her, kill that Crimson Demon girl first!
Yunyun, you said Explosion is a useless spell, right? I’ll let you witness the destructive power of this useless magic!
Eh? Wait, wait, are you going to?
Explosion–!!
Did you see that, my ultimate move–Explosion! Do you still dare say it’s a useless magic? How’s that Kazuma, how many points for that explosion?
Minus ninety points! You idiot, what do you intend to accomplish by exhausting your magic like that? There are still enemies left, I can’t piggyback you and run!
Ka, Kazuma-san! While you were talking, more enemies were attracted by the noise!!
Hey, what are you doing? Can you even fight these guys?
Fufu, please remember it well. You don’t think I’m a woman who can only use recovery magic, right? I’m Aqua-sama with maxed out stats! I just need one hand to settle thing with these mob level devils. Watch, I’ll show you that I can act like a proper goddess occasionally, too!
Aqua, we’re running! Stop intimidating them with those weird poses and come here!
… Ah
Disappear without even a trace of your flesh, burn in the dark flames from the abyss of my heart!
Oh no, I can’t suppress it anymore! Become the sacrifice to pacify my destructive urges!
Come, fall into eternal slumber… In the embrace of my ice-cold arms…!
Please rest in peace. I won’t forget you all. That’s right, your existence will be engraved forever… In the memories of my soul…!
Hey…! Wait…! Stop…!
Light of Saber!
Light of Saber!
– Of Saber!
– Saber!
I heard the sound of Explosion in the distance, so I came with the members of the anti-Demon King’s army guerilla unit… But isn’t that Megumin and Yunyun? What are you two doing here?
Aren’t you the son of the shoe shop owner, Bukkoroli? Long time no see, we heard that the village was in danger and rushed back.
Danger?
By the way Megumin, are they your adventuring comrades?
I’m Bukkoroli. Son of the owner of the number one shoe shop in the Crimson Demon village. Archwizard that wields Advanced Magic…!
Well met, I’m Satou Kazuma. Master of many skills in Axel, one who battled with the generals of the Demon King’s army. Please take care of me.
Ohhh!
Awesome, so awesome! Normally, people would have weird reactions after we introduced ourselves…! I never thought there’d be an outsider who’d reply in kind!
… Kazuma seems really friendly with Bukkoroli and the others! And you didn’t react this way when I made my introduction!
I’m Aqua! An existence worshiped by the masses, the one who’ll defeat the Demon King! My real identity’s the goddess of water!
Is that so, that’s amazing!
Wait! Why? Hey, why am I the only one who gets such reactions?
I-I’m Dustiness Ford Lala… ti… na… From Axel… Ughh…!
Megumin, I’m glad you have such wonderful comrades. The village is still some ways off. Come, we’ll show you in, outsiders. We’ll send you there with Teleport!
Welcome to the Crimson Demon village, outsiders. Megumin and Yunyun too, welcome home!!
Well then, we’ll resume our security patrol.
Goodbye then!
These guys are really cool. They’re like a group of combat experts.
Is that so? The four of them must be smiling gleefully nearby after hearing that.
… Nearby? Didn’t they leave via teleport?
They turned invisible by using light refraction. Teleport consumes a lot of mana, so they’ll run out if they use it so frequently after a battle. I think they just wanted to show off a cool exit… Ouch!
On a side note, light refraction magic deploys a barrier a few meters around a specific person or object, obscuring the view of the inside of the barrier from the outside… And so, you can see them if you go nearer.
…!
?
Say, these guys are really something. I can’t catch them even with my speed.
They ran away by doping with body strengthening magic. I don’t think that group of NEETs who laze around at home would have such stamina.
… NEET group? No, aren’t they the anti-Demon King’s army guerrilla unit? They left because they have to perform patrols.
They’re idle people who can’t leave their parents or find jobs. If they go to other cities as adventurers, they would be in high demand, but they refuse to leave the village. Idling around all day with nothing to do, in order to not let others think they were just lazing around, they claim to be the anti-Demon King’s army guerrilla unit and wander around the vicinity of the village.
All Crimson Demons can learn Advanced Magic in adulthood. Everyone in the village is an Archwizard. After learning Advanced Magic, we’ll master all kinds of spells with the skill points we earned. This is common sense…
… Eh, this griffon statue looks so realistic. Is that a work of a famous sculptor?
That’s a griffon who wandered into the village and got petrified. It looks cool, so it was preserved as a scenic attraction. And now, it’s mainly used as a landmark to meet up with people.
… What magic are you planning to use?
A spell to cure abnormal statuses. I’ve never seen a live griffon before.
No, that’s just a letter to my daughter about how I’ve been doing. I got a little carried away when writing it. My Crimson Demon bloodline makes it impossible for me to write normal letters…
I don’t really understand that.
… Eh? Um, D-Dad? Well, I’m happy that you’re okay, but can you explain it in detail? First, at the beginning of the letter you wrote, ‘By the time you read this letter, I will probably have already passed on from this world’…
Isn’t that the standard greeting amongst us Crimson Demons? Didn’t you learn that in school?… Ah, now that you mentioned it, you and Megumin graduated early because your results were excellent.
… And the part about being unable to break through the military base built by the Demon King’s army…?
Ah, that part? Those guys built a very extravagant base. Should we destroy it or keep it as a new scenic attraction? We couldn’t decide.
Hey Yunyun, can I punch your father?
Go ahead.
Yunyun?!
… Hmm? Wait, so the Demon King’s army did build a military base here. So, the part about the ‘Demon King’s General was coming’ was…
That’s correct, it’s as stated on the letter, they sent a General with high magic resistance here. Right, right, it’s almost time. If you’re free, do you want to come and take a look?
Demon King’s army alert, Demon King’s army alert. Everyone who’s free please gather before the griffon statue at the village entrance. We have visuals of the enemy, they number about a thousand.
One thousand?
A thousand soldiers of the Demon King’s army. Seems like it’s time to show the real power of a goddess.
Don’t fret, this is the village of powerful mages, the Crimson Demon village. Let’s go and look, shall we?
Waaahhhh!! Uwaaahhhh!!
Sylvia-sama! Sylvia-sama!! Please retreat! Even if only you make it-Please retreat!
Damn, damn it! We can take our revenge if we’re a little bit closer to these vermin…!
That’s why I objected to attacking the Crimson Demon village- that’s why I didn’t want to come…!
Lightning Strike!
Energy Ignition!
Freeze Gust!
Cursed Lightning!
Amazing… It feels terrifying for them to be so powerful…
Everyone! I’ll block them from the front, so follow me! The gap between casting two high-level spells is large. Let’s use this chance…!
Tornado!!
Inferno!
Oh my~ What a show. So that’s what real Crimson Demons are like, huh?
When you say real, you’re implying there are fakes. Hey, tell me, where are the fake Crimson Demons?
Oh, Megumin’s sister, huh? Such a cute kid.
It feels like a mini Megumin. Hey little Megumin, want some sweets?
Komekko, I’m home. Have you been a good girl?
Dad! Onee-chan brought a man back with her!
Watch closely. The mug I placed upside down on the low table will move around like so!
Amazing! Amazing!! How did you do that? Hey, how? Blue-haired nee-chan, how did you do that?
It’s magnets! It must be moved by the magnets under the table! Right? Am I right, Aqua?
Ah– …!Cough, cough!
… Thanks for taking care of my daughter. I express my sincere gratitude for that.
My daughter has troubled you very much… I learned much about Kazuma-san from the letters she sent back… So, we know you quite well…
… Well then. What’s your relationship with my daughter?
… I’ve already said it many times, we’re just normal friends and comrades.
… Well then. What’s your relationship with my daughter?
… I’ve already said it many times, we’re just normal friends and comrades.
What did you sayyyyyy?
Hubbyyyyyy! Stop! Don’t flip and damage the table! Our finances are really tight this month!
Pardon me, I was too agitated. All because you kept playing dumb and saying you’re just friends.
This is… Just a simple gift for your hospitality…
… My dear, this is a gift from Kazuma-san to me. Let go.
Oh, really now hubby. You were just addressing him rudely as ‘you’, and you suddenly change it to ‘Kazuma-san’ after seeing the gift, just how thick-skinned are you? This will be dinner tonight, I won’t let you eat it as snacks for your wine, all right?
Food? Hey, that’s solid food, right? Not porridge so thin you can’t even see the rice, but something that’ll make you full?
Really… It isn’t much…
You came at the right time, Kazuma-san! My dear, serve him our best tea!
There’s only one type of tea in the house, I’ll brew some right now, a moment please!
… For you. It tastes good.
Komekko, don’t get any closer! Come to onee-chan, quick!
That’s right Komekko! That man always plays obscene pranks on your sister. Come here before he lays his claws on you!
Thank you, Komekko can have it. Onii-chan’s already full.
… No matter how much food you bring, I won’t give you Komekko!
That’s a misunderstanding! Please don’t listen to those two!
By the way, I heard Kazuma-san has a huge amount of debt, correct? I won’t object since I feel that Kazuma-san’s a good person… But if you want to be with our daughter, shouldn’t you do so after clearing your debts…?
What do you mean by ‘be with your daughter’? Didn’t I just explain that we’re just friends?
From the letters sent by my daughter, I thought the two of you were close, right…?
No, wait, may I ask what was written on the letters?
For example, …
Admiring the scene of my daughter being covered in goo.
Saying things like, ‘Did your bust grow bigger?’ while piggybacking my daughter.
Bathing together with my daughter.
When my daughter was napping defenseless on the couch, you’ll squat down with your hands on your knees to peek under her skirt.
When feeding Chomusuke, you’ll put panties before him and say, ‘Listen up, it looks like this, if you can steal this for me, I’ll treat you to better food’, teaching him to do bad things.
… And so, your relationship is so close that sexual harassment becomes commonplace…
Even so, my daughter still thinks you’re an important comrade she can’t just ignore. She even wrote that even though you’re a pervert who is full of debt with poor combat skills, vulgar language, and lacks common sense, she can’t leave you alone because you’ll die easily if she doesn’t keep an eye on you. My daughter already said this much, so I think there must be something…
According to my daughter, she’s the main damage dealer in Kazuma-san’s team; the team won’t be able to function without her. And she was the one who defeated the Demon King’s General Vanir, forced another general out from his castle by bombarding his castle every day, and made huge contributions in subjugating that general…
Hmm. And she was the one to deal the final blow to the Mobile Fortress Destroyer! Oh, my daughter really made a name for herself!
The letter also states many things about you and your comrades… Well, do you still have a lot of debt? This concerns the team my daughter’s in. We want to help, too, but my family’s not that well off…
Ah, no, the debt’s already been cleared. I should be able to get a large amount of money after this trip, so there are no problems, don’t worry.
… Oh. Pray tell how much you’ll be getting…
About three hundred million eris.
Three hundred million?
Ah, Kazuma-san, that’s right, how about staying here for the night? You’re my daughter’s comrade, so we must treat you well! How about staying here from now on? As an adventurer, you’re probably wandering around without a fixed home, right?
Yes! Komekko, sleep with me and dad in the living room tonight! Those two can just sleep in our room! But our house is small, so there’s only our room and Megumin’s old room… It’s a bit cramped for so many people to stay here… Hey hubby, how about…
No, no need… I, well, have a mansion in Axel…
Mansion!!
Next! Something amazing will come out from this box!
Something will definitely jump out when she opens it! That’s it, Komekko!
Amazing! Amazing!
Mum! Meat! Meat!
My dear, I hear that vegetables are good for your skin, so leave the meat to me. I wish for you to be beautiful forever!
Ara, ara, hubby, your hair’s thinning, eating the seaweed salad should be enough for you!
Hey, Dad, Mum! The blue-haired nee-chan’s amazing! She made a big Neroid come out from a small box!
It was amazing, Kazuma. Something physically impossible happened: A Neroid physically larger than the box came out and flew away through the window. I’ve been thinking about that all this while…
… Say, this has been bothering me for a while now, can I watch your tricks carefully?
Don’t wanna. Performances aren’t done by request, I’ll do so only when I feel hyped up. If you want to see it no matter what, then prepare a party that’ll make me want to perform.
How dumb… I already aimed for your mouth, so catch it properly… Stop, stop! You don’t even drink much, don’t take all of my pea pods!
What nonsense is this? Aren’t you concerned about your daughter? What you’re doing is sending a delicious lamb into the cage of a beast that’s been starved for a week!
Even if you say that… They’ve been living under the same roof all this while, and nothing went wrong, correct? There aren’t any problems. My daughter is of marriageable age, and Kazuma-san’s a sensible adult… Even if something did happen, wouldn’t that mean both parties were willing? If that’s the case, I can’t say anything even as a parent.
… By the way, Darkness-san, why are you so against this? Would it be inconvenient for you if Kazuma-san sleeps together with my daughter?
Huh? That’s like saying I’m jealous, it feels unpleasant, please don’t say that…
Is, is that so, my apologies. I seemed to be mistaken. But it would be too cramped to move my daughter to the other room. If no one sleeps in the same room as Kazuma-san…
Just let Hyoizaburo-san sleep with Kazuma, problem solved.
Eh?
That’s not lewd at all–eh, no, from what I understand about my daughter’s letter, letting Komekko sleep with him is out of the question, and I’ll feel uneasy if the head of the family does that too…
In that case…! I’ll sleep beside him! If it’s me, even if that beast tried anything, I’ll resist to the end…! No, maybe resistance would be futile, and I’ll become a playtime for his abnormal lust and do something incredible. That, that’s right, he must’ve accumulated a lot of lust during this journey. He even stayed up all night! I heard that boys will become agitated after staying up all night…! He might forcefully press me down despite my resistance, cover my mouth and say to me threateningly, ‘You’ll wake Komekko, keep quiet unless you want everyone to hear this’ and…
Sleep.
Ara, Kazuma-san. Just finished your bath? Darkness-san fell asleep, could you help me carry her to the room?
You’ve been of great help. Darkness-san must be tired from her tough journey, and won’t wake before morning. My husband, Komekko, and I are all deep sleepers, so we won’t wake even if it’s a bit noisy… Kazuma-san, you must be tired, do retire early for today.
Eh, well… I won’t hold back and go straight to sleep… Just to let you know, I’ve known Megumin for a long time so there won’t be any accidents, all right? Please don’t believe what that perverted crusader who’s been holding it in said.
I know, I know, so no problem! If something does happen, you’ll take proper responsibility…!
Both of you, enjoy yourselves…!
Lock!
Morning. Did you sleep well?
Hmm… Morning Kazuma… Um, how long did I sleep…?
I see…
… So, why am I sleeping in the same bedding as Kazuma?
… Don’t make me say it, it’s embarrassing.
What did you say?
Hey, don’t pull the blankets, it’s cold. Calm down first.
Why are you so calm? The first thing I noticed after waking up was that I was sleeping with Kazuma in my nostalgic room! How can I stay calm…?
Hey, do you really think I’m a lowlife who’ll do something to you while you were sleeping? I’ve been wondering for a while now, what do you all think I am? We’ve been living in the same mansion for over a year now and nothing’s happened, right? Darkness too, treating me like some sort of beast when she heard I would be sleeping with Megumin.
… Ugh. You, you have a point, sorry… I’m a bit confused seeing this straight after waking up… You, you’re right, Kazuma might sexually harass others when he cracks jokes, but he isn’t someone who’ll do it for real.
Of course, don’t look down on me. After all, your mother was the one who pushed me into this room. She even locked it with a spell, so I’ve got no choice but to hide in the blanket.
Really, she…
That’s how it is. It’s cold outside, so get in. Don’t worry, I won’t do anything.
… You really won’t do anything? It’s just the two of us here.
Don’t be stupid, it’s such a rare chance for the two of us to be alone, how can I not do anything? I’ve even gotten permission from your parents!
I knew that would happen! I’ll sleep over at Yunyun’s place tonight!!
Ahhh? Damn, it’s a trap!!
Megumin, Megumin, it’s a rare chance for us to visit, so take us sightseeing around the village.
Sightseeing…? You do know that this village is at war with the Demon King’s army, right?
No problem. Since the village is safe, we can teleport back to Axel if you want to. Since Aqua proposed so, let’s spend the day relaxing in the village and stay another night.
Hmm, so there are people here who can teleport us to Axel. The journey back will be much easier.
Trashzuma seems really happy. I’ll be sightseeing together with Megumin, what about the others?
All right, I don’t have anything to do anyway, so I… Hey, what did you just call me?
Did I say something strange?
No, no… Just my imagination, right…? Never mind, what about you, Darkness?
There’s somewhere I want to go. I heard the blacksmith here is skilled, so I want to visit as an armor enthusiast. Scumzuma, go ahead with your sightseeing without me.
Well, okay… Hey, what did you just say?!
So, it’ll be Aqua, Lowlifezuma, and me sightseeing. There are many scenic places in the village, I don’t think it’ll be boring–
Wait a minute!
What is it, Trashzuma who wanted to make a move on the sleeping Megumin?
I’m very sorry…!!
I hope the orcs attack you again.
What is this?
This is the holy relic of this village…
No matter how I look at it, this is a figurine of a cat-eared girl in swimwear.
A long time ago, our ancestors saved a traveler who was attacked by monsters… As thanks, the traveler gifted this holy relic to them. The traveler said that this is a relic even more important than his own life. We don’t know what goddess this is, but good things might happen if we pray to it, so we placed it here in deep reverence. I heard that the way to construct these buildings known as shrines was taught to our ancestors by this traveler.
Hey Kazuma, it displeases me how that figurine is being treated as well as me, an actual goddess.
As the one who sent the guy with this thing here, you should be the one apologizing to the Crimson Demons.
This is the holy sword that’s said to grant immense powers to the one who pulls it out.
As expected of the Crimson Demon village! Such an amazing thing!
Hey, hey, can we try?
That’s fine, but it’ll take some time; you need to pay a challenge fee to the old blacksmith first. You can challenge this after paying and each person will have only one try.
The old blacksmith made this sword to attract tourists. A spell has been cast on it, so that only the ten thousandth person can pull it out. There have only been a hundred or so challengers. After all, this sword has only been here for four short years.
Hey, isn’t the history of his holy sword too recent?
Hey, I can probably break the seal with my magic. Can I take this sword with me?
Please don’t do that. This is one of the attractions in this village, don’t pull it out!
This is known as the ‘Wishing Fountain’. There’s a legend about this fountain. If you give offerings such as axes or coins, you can summon the goddess of gold and silver. Even now, there are people who throw axes and coins in.
I don’t know who spread this legend… If not for the kind blacksmith who clears the fountain periodically, this place would’ve become a pool of weapons.
… By the way, what did the blacksmith do with the coins and weapons he fished out?
He recycles them into new weapons and armor, of course.
Well then, off to the next attraction… Hmm? Where did Aqua go?
… Hey, what are you doing? I can’t let my guard down with you around.
I heard there were people who threw their coins in, so I dove down and picked them up… Hey, when it’s the tourist season, I’ll allow you to hire me as the goddess of this fountain.
Okay, I’ll throw an axe into the water. Catch it and turn it into money for me.
Let’s go to the next attraction, next one!
This is the underground facility that seals the ‘weapon that might destroy the world’. No one knows when it appeared here… I heard that this facility was built at the same time as that mysterious facility over there…
What do you mean by ‘mysterious facility’? What’s that building used for?
I mean it’s literally a mysterious facility. Even after going inside to investigate, we still don’t know who built it, for what purpose or even when it was built. So, we call it the ‘mysterious facility’ and it has been like this all this time.
Well, the ‘weapon that might destroy the world’ sounds really scary, but this entire village are experts in magic, so the seal won’t be undone so easily. It was a good choice to seal it away here.
You came too late; there was the ‘tomb of the evil god’ and ‘place where the unknown goddess was sealed’. But something happened and their seals were broken.
Aren’t your seals here too unreliable? Hey, is it fine to put the ‘prohibited weapon that might destroy the world’ in this place?
No, no problem. To unseal the place, you need to solve a riddle and input the correct answer. The riddle is written in an ancient language no one understands… So, there are no problems, trust me on this!
Welcome… Hmm? Megumin, are these two outsiders?
I’m Chekera! An Archwizard that wields Advanced Magic! Shop owner of the number one tailor shop in the Crimson Demon Clan!
Once again, welcome to my shop! Oh, it’s been so long since I saw an outsider! How long has it been since I made my grand introduction? Thanks to you, I’m much more relaxed now.
I’m Satou Kazuma. So this is the top tailor shop of the Crimson Demons, that’s impressive.
This is the only tailor shop in the Crimson Demon village , after all.
Are you messing around with me?
There aren’t many shops in the village anyway. This is the only tailor and there’s only one shoe store. All the other shops are one of a kind too.
Putting that aside… What brings you here? You want new clothes?
I want to buy a spare robe to wear. Do you have the same type as the one I’m wearing? Yunyun gave me this robe, but it isn’t convenient if there’s only one.
– This type… I have a batch that’s just been dyed.
I’ll take them all.
All of them? Oh, that Megumin is now a bourgeois…? Seems like you’re doing well as an adventurer.
Of course, it’s about time the villagers learn about my exploits outside. And this robe is my battle wear, it’ll be good to have more of it… And so, Kazuma who’s going to be rich soon, lend me money.
Ah, you… Hah, forget it, we probably won’t visit this village ever again. I’ll lend you some.
… Hey.
…? What is it?
You, this… Hey wait, how can you use this terrible thing as a laundry pole?
Oh, do you know what this thing is used for, customer? This laundry pole has been passed down in my family for generations. It won’t rust, so we treat it like a treasure.
No matter how I look at it, isn’t this a rifle?
The view here’s really great. If I knew, I would’ve brought our lunch box and we could have picnicked here.
If you want to see the view, there’s an observation platform at the top of the hill. The magic telescope is powerful enough to see the Demon King’s castle. I heard the most recommended watch spot is the room of the Demon King’s daughter.
You guys are really worthless; even the Demon King’s castle has been commoditized by you.
Hey Megumin, the view’s nice here, but didn’t I tell you I wanted to visit somewhere romantic?
This place is romantic. This is known as the ‘hill of the demon god’. Legends say that if you confess here and become a couple, you’ll be bound together by the curse of the demon god and can never break up. This is a romantic attraction made for lovers…
What a depressing love story! It’s not romantic at all…! What’s that?
Hey Megumin! There are Demon King’s soldiers there! Isn’t that near your house?
Let me look. They’re relentless. I don’t understand why they keep attacking despite us beating them up so thoroughly. If they’re sneaking around, their objective is probably not to attack the people, but something like the facility inside the village.
Isn’t there a tomb sealing an evil god? An objective that matches the Demon King’s army would be the revival of an evil god… But isn’t the seal broken?
It was broken. What else would the Demon King’s army want…? Could it be the holy relic inside the cat ear shrine…?
If the Demon King really wants something like that, I think it’d be better for him to be wiped out along with this village.
Maybe they’re aiming for the prohibited weapon that might destroy the world or something?
That’s impossible. After all, that facility’s sealed differently from the other places, and no one knows the way to use that weapon.
Anyway, no one in the village has discovered them yet, they’ll be invaded! Let’s hurry down and tell everyone that the Demon King’s army is here!
As expected of Kazuma, skillful in using the influence of others to intimidate people.
What’s with this woman? Where did she come from? What’s your goal?
Sylvia-sama! She didn’t run for help and lacks any means to attack powerfully, that’s too suspicious! This might be a trap, let’s retreat!
You shall not pass! You’ll have to defeat me if you want to go any further! However, I definitely won’t be defeated by the likes of the Demon King’s army!
What a troublesome woman! Her attacks are pathetic, but her defense is incredibly tough! Why can’t she just run after learning the difference in our prowess? Sylvia-sama, let’s ignore her and complete our main objective!
Darkness, good work in hanging in there for so long! We’re here to save you!
Ka-Kazuma? What, why are you here so soon…?
I was disappointed when I heard the orcs I had great hopes for were all female, and now, even the Demon King’s army boss is a woman! Hey, if you’ve any pride as an underling of the Demon King, show me your might! If you have the guts, make me submit to you and scream ‘Master~❤’ or something!
Just shut up, you just messed up your chance to put up a great performance.
Hee… Did you miss your attack on purpose to make us underestimate you, while your real purpose was to buy time? With defenses powerful enough to stop us for so long, you must be a high leveled Crusader… Not hitting my minions with your attack was just an act to hide your real skills huh… Not bad…
… Ah, ah, since, since you saw through it… It can’t be helped…
You’re Sylvia, right? That Crusader’s my comrade and the hero who took an Explosion head on in the battle with Demon King’s general, Vanir. You’re pretty good to grasp her true abilities in just this brief exchange…
Hey Megumin, the way Kazuma’s putting it seems weird.
Shh! It looks interesting, so let’s observe for now. Maybe he’ll boast about us too.
… Vanir, you say? I heard he went to Axel and never came back… Could it be you all…?
That’s right, the one beside me–Megumin, dealt him the final blow.
Not just that, the four of us even faced the Dullahan Beldia, the deadly poison slime Hans, and the high bounty target Mobile Fortress Destroyer, and defeated them all!
What, what did you say…? I heard about the defeat of Beldia, but when did Hans–? His periodic report from Alcanretia stopped, so it might be true…!
… You’re the leader of your team, right? Can you tell me your name?
… Mitsurugi Kyouya. That’s my name.
Mitsurugi…! Now I understand. I heard about the magic sword user Mitsurugi… You’ve got a weird sword with you too, which confirms it. You’re my type, you know…? But for the Crimson Demons and a powerful character like you to be here, this is troubling. Can you let me off this one time?
… This jerk got scared at the crucial moment again. He just had to state that fellow’s name.
He was arrogant because of the mob of Crimson Demons behind him, but he’s backing off right now.
That’s true, it would be my victory if we fought right now, but it wouldn’t feel right. It’d be as if I borrowed the might of the Crimson Demons to defeat you. Very well, I’ll let you run for now. That is, if the Crimson Demons behind me will allow you to.
My deep thanks, Mitsurugi. Farewell, we’ll have a proper match next time! My name is Sylvia, a general of the Demon King’s army…! Retreat!
You won’t escape! Lightning Strike!
Light of Saber!
Catch her for magic experimentation, ahhh!
– General of the Demon King’s army, Sylvia, huh…?
Hey Kazuma, you’re not done with your act yet?
That onee-san was amazing! She was fine even after being hit by magic and arrows!
Ha, it’s nothing… As a Crusader, this isn’t much…
I heard about it too, Darkness-san. You’re the one who stopped Sylvia’s infiltration, right? This team’s dependable, I can leave my daughter in Kazuma-san’s care without worries now. Oh right, about the room allocation tonight, Kazuma-san…
Eh, where did Hyoizaburo-san go?
My husband said he had plenty of work to do and decided to sleep over at his workshop… I’ll heat the water up, then.
By the way, your taunts are great, let’s settle things with Sylvia next time!
That’s a great idea, I already ordered a popular model of armor from a skilled blacksmith, and it’ll be done in a few days. Hehe, I’m looking forward to the armor and the duel with Sylvia…!
What nonsense are the two of you saying? We’re going home tomorrow. We finished sightseeing and have no reason to stay in this village. We’ll rush home with haste tomorrow and spend our days lazing at home.
Huh?
Running away after saying such a cool line? Didn’t she ask you to settle things with her next time?
Fighting such a beautiful general would weigh on my conscience, so let’s adopt a more conservative strategy this time. We can enjoy a bubbly NEET life after going home, so why should I wait here for that Demon King’s general to find trouble with me?
Why you! After making such a grand scene, you’re going to run away?
You’re not planning to meet them ever again after intimidating them so much? That’s going too far!
Not really, I was just thinking that we’ll be going home tomorrow, so I acted cool for fun. The chance of us meeting again will be very low. Why would I say something like that to a Demon King’s General? I only did so because the Crimson Demons got my back in that moment.
This fellow’s too much! What a jerk!
And you call yourself a human being?
Everyone, the water’s ready… Ara, what’s the matter?
Nothing, let me take the bath first.
Hey wait, don’t run!
We’re not done yet!
Hmm? Why do you look as if you just had a bath?
I bathed outside, they told me there’s a bathhouse nearby called ‘mixed hot spring’.
Megumin, where are you going so late at night? I won’t allow my daughter who’s in her delicate age to stay outside! You came back from somewhere early this morning too!
For me who’s in my delicate age, my own house is the most dangerous, so I’ll sleep over at Yunyun’s! You’re scheming to make me sleep with Kazuma, right?
Ara, it’ll be fine if it’s Kazuma-san. Trust your mother’s judgement, he definitely wouldn’t let me down…
You’re turning against your daughter for an outsider? No, you only said that because you understood his true nature, right? ‘Not let you down’ means exactly that, correct?
I don’t care what you’re quarreling over, I’m going to sleep… After my bath, I see that even Darkness is sleeping, I should turn in too…
No point in talking about this further! I’m sleeping over at Yunyun’s place!
I won’t let you escape! Ankle Snare!
What, what? You used magic on your own daughter, are you really a mothe-…?
Sleep.
I’m sorry, Kazuma-san, my daughter fell asleep at a strange place… Could you help me carry her to her room?
Hey Megumin, stop pretending to sleep. You’re awake, right?
Freeze!
… Ugh…
Morning Megumin, did you sleep well?
… Morning. Hmm? Is this my room?
–!! You finally crossed the line, you beast! Kazuma, you animal! I thought you are a coward who would commit sexual harassment, but doesn’t have the guts to do it when the time comes!
Hey, hold it, I didn’t do anything! It’s just handholding, don’t make such a fuss! Look, isn’t it much colder than yesterday? I only held your hand unconsciously because it was too cold.
You, you really didn’t do anything? And with the lesson from yesterday, I won’t trust you so easily.
Idiot, how long did you think you’ve been sleeping? I’ve been staying by your side honestly all this while.
Is, is that so? Sorry, Kazuma, I misunderstood you again. That’s true, if Kazuma had the guts to cross the line, you would’ve taken a gamble and made a move on Darkness… I said something rude, I apologize.
Ah, it’s fine. However, it would be nice to thank me occasionally, right? All of you keep getting caught up in troublesome matters, and I keep having to clean up after you. Don’t you think I deserve some thanks?
… Gratitude, right? You have a point.
… Thank you for taking me in when I had nowhere to go in Axel, even though I’m a troublesome mage who can only use Explosion. Thank you for carrying me home after I exhaust my mana. Thank you for letting me stay on the team despite all the troubles I caused you.
What’s the matter? I’m just thanking you, right? Weren’t you the one who asked for this? Why are you acting so shy?
… Well, um, I was saved by you all numerous times too. According to your customs… I’m Satou Kazuma, the one who gets dragged repeatedly into troublesome matters, holder of the weakest job in Axel. My goal is to earn a lot of money and live happily ever after with all of you… Please, please take care of me from now on!
Me too, please take care of me from now on… By the way, it’s really cold today. The house is run down, so maybe the cold got in from somewhere… Um, Kazuma really won’t do anything to me, right? It’s too cold, so I’ll go back into the blanket.
… Me-Megumin, aren’t you a bit too close…?
You’re always sexually harassing me, and now you act all timid? And you said you wouldn’t do anything, right? It should be fine then.
… Hey, hey, don’t be so proactive, young girl. That time at the campsite too, if you do something like that out of the blue, my heart won’t be able to take it… Last night, Darkness even told your mother that letting you sleep with me was like putting a lamb into the cage of a beast that had been starving for a week.
Did Darkness say that? But she also said that even in a situation where you can do it for real, you would be too timid to act and brush it off with a joke.
Hey, what do you talk about with Darkness when you’re alone with her? Tell me, I promise I won’t get angry.
… Hey, you two must’ve been speaking ill of me.
It’s a secret. Be-besides that, let’s tuck in early. We’re returning to Axel tomorrow, right? Let’s go back to our peaceful days there.
… I feel like visiting the washroom.
Ah, but your mom locked the door today–
She really… Never mind, I’ll go out from the windows tonight…
… Kazuma, what’s going on?
… Winter Shogun passed by just now and left after freezing the window.
Kazuma! What happened just now? This must be Kazuma’s handiwork! I know Kazuma did this, but I don’t understand what your objective is! Why did you freeze the window?
… If I tell you that honestly, will you promise not to be mad?
If you don’t tell me, I’ll get everyone to treat you in a crueler manner than today.
… Are you an idiot? Is Kazuma someone who can react according to the situation or an idiot? Give my gratitude just now back!
You’re absolutely right. I think it’s strange too, why did I act so dumb for two nights in a row?
Open the door! Hey, open it…! Mom, mom!
… How should I put this, it’s cold so let’s sleep for now. It’ll be fine, I won’t do anything, trust me. If you can’t hold it in… There’s an empty bottle over there.
Let me ask you again, what do you want me to do with that empty bottle? And I trusted you until just now, but I feel a sense of danger like never before! Ah, this is really…
It’s my fault, I guarantee you that I won’t do anything. I must’ve been possessed by an evil spirit to have frozen the window with magic. I’m really sorry.
At least say that when you’re out of the blanket…
Yahoo!
Kazuma, you’ll get it from me in the morning.
Don’t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.
… Hey, aren’t you cold? I’m really cold, so come closer.
… I really want you to give back the nice atmosphere just now…
Freeze.
You just complained about it being cold and you’re casting freeze? Just how much do you want to stick to me?
Sigh… There’s only one pillow, so you use it. I’ll sleep on your arm.
Hey, hey, I’ll feel troubled if you lean over so obediently.
Just like Darkness said, ‘Even in a situation where you can do it for real, you’ll be too timid to act and brush it off with a joke.’
Demon King’s army alert! Demon King’s army alert! A portion of the Demon King’s army has infiltrated the village!
Ah… Ahhh! Just a bit further! A little more…! …Sigh, why must I meet you at a time like this? As expected of you, my subordinates’ diversion attack didn’t work on you at all! Did you rush here after realizing my true objective? Mit–
You’re noisy, shut it.
Asking me to shut it? You might be a magic sword user, but a mere human dare–
Didn’t I tell you to shut it? Are you looking for a beating? Interrupting me when things are going so well, who do you think you are? What time do you think it is? Do you think the neighbors don’t need to sleep?
Sor- sorry…
Hey, how dare you yell at me, you’ve got guts. Come at me together with that girl there, I’ll finish off both of you in one go!
Ara, ara, were you having a good time with that kid there? I really did something that spoiled the mood then.
Hey! Why is it so noisy in the middle of the night? What’s happening? Did Megumin sleep too much and cast an explosion?
Hey Aqua, a general of the Demon King’s army is attacking! Get Hyoizaburo-san or Madam to come here!
I won’t hold back just because you’re a beauty! I’m all for gender equality, a man who won’t hesitate in drop kicking an evil woman!
Ara, I was hoping you’d show me some mercy. Thank you for calling me a beauty! I feel like just eating you up!
Hmm, what is it? A gift for me?
… This is a magic sword? The craftsmanship’s too rough… Are you really Mitsurugi? Is the magic sword Gram something like this?
It’s Chunchunmaru.
… Ah?
I said this sword is Chunchunmaru. This is a really normally named sword, Chunchunmaru. Don’t compare it with Gram, some name that sounds like the bones of a horse.
… Fufu, hahaha! You’re not the magic sword user Mitsurugi, right? Can you tell me your real name, and why you’re pretending to be Mitsurugi?
… My name’s Satou Kazuma. I pretended to be Mitsurugi because I don’t want you to know my real name and target me.
Ah, hah! Hahaha! That’s amazing, your idea is too wonderful! I like it!
Hey, I already told Madam who’s waking Darkness, she’ll be right there!
Stop resisting! Bind!
This man’s my hostage! That girl over there, I don’t know why you didn’t cast any spells, but this man will be dragged in if you do!
What…! Ka-Kazuma! Are you all right? You seem to be enjoying yourself.
Hmm? You look like a devil! I won’t let you escape, the one panting heavily in your chest right now’s my important… Important… Hey Kazuma! What’s my relationship with you? What should I say to look cool?
Hey boy, don’t breathe hot air into me, it’s making me excited. Be a good boy and I’ll give you a reward later.
But, but I can’t breathe like this…
Sacred Exorcism!
? Ahhh!!
You, you’ve done it now…! Even my leather one-piece dress made from the skin of low-level devils is torn…! But too bad, I’m not a pure devil. It might hurt, but it’s not lethal. Listen up, if you attack again, I’ll kill him!
My name is Sylvia! Director of the monster enhancement division, the one who’ll keep modifying my own body! That’s right, I’m a chimera, growth chimera Sylvia! I’ll take this boy with me. My cute boy, become one with me again, Bind!
Ka-Kazuma! Give Kazuma back…! … Kazuma, you didn’t resist just now, are you doing this on purpose?
No.
Ugh…! I was too careless…!
Demon King’s general! The people in this household have gone off to get the other Crimson Demons! It’s only a matter of time before reinforcements come. Throw that hopeless man who’s closing his eyes blissfully while putting his head into your breasts away and disappear! If you want a hostage no matter what… Pick me…! I’ll take his place! Please let me be the hostage in place of Kazuma!
Ara, hey, you’re quite the ladies’ man! Two lovers? But no, I like him. Hey, you’re Kazuma, right? How about joining the Demon King’s army? I think you and I’ll get along well.
… Hey, Kazuma has gotten really close to the enemy before I knew it. She’s even patting his head.
… Hey Kazuma, why are you stuck in a place like that…?Sigh, I really can’t let my guard down. You must’ve been seduced by the breasts of that woman. Can’t be helped, I’ll save you now, so stay still…
Don’t bother.
Huh?
I said don’t bother. All of you, especially Darkness, your attitudes toward me recently have been terrible. Sylvia-san here’s treating me very nicely. As you all have been treating me terribly all the time, I was just thinking of switching my allegiance to the Demon King’s army, instead. Apologize, it’s about time for you to apologize for making me clean up after you girls! Megumin thanked me just now too, so apologize!
Hey… Hey Kazuma, don’t joke like that. It’s so convincing that it doesn’t feel like a joke at all. Um… It’s true, we were a bit mean to you… Um, I went too far when I was introducing you to Megumin’s family, sorry. Oh right, didn’t you say you wanted a medal? I understand, your accomplishments are exemplary, when we go back to Axel I’ll…
Can you act more sincerely?! It’s too late to tempt me with money now, show me your sincerity! Look closely at the situation right now! Sylvia-san’s showing me her bountiful peaks! And what about your strong point? Say it! Say it now!
My, my defense…?
Wrong! Isn’t your strong point your slutty body that can seduce men? Why are you saying stupid stuff and pretending to be a pure girl?
Hey, this man’s beyond saving. He’s talking strangely, let’s leave him to the Demon King’s army.
No, we can’t, even so, he’s still useful during crucial moments.
I-I…! Never, did seduce…!
Yes, you did! Really, your body’s so slutty! Tonight! My luck stat is at the max! This is probably the most popular period of my life! Apologize now! If you don’t want me who’s at the most popular period of my life to leave with Sylvia-san, then apologize! For example, … Let me think…
Good, good… As expected of the man I set my eyes on! I’ll let you join the Demon King’s army! But don’t bully that Crusader girl too much, all right? You have to treat the delicate hearts of girls with care.
You’re a demon, but you could empathize with the feelings of young girls, huh…? It’s impossible to discern the age of demons from appearance, could your empathy stem from experience of being a thousand-year-old woman?
Ara, of course I understand, be it the heart of young girls or boys.
After all, half of me is a man.
…… What?
Hmm, didn’t I tell you?
I’m a chimera. These breasts you like so much aren’t natural, but added after the fact.
… Ka-Kazuma? Um… You, pull yourself together…! Hey! Snap out of it! It, it’ll be okay, calm… Calm down…
By the way, you really are a nice man… Just caressing your head like that makes my breasts and lower body excited.
Sylvia-san, Sylvia-san, there’s something hard pressed against my butt… that’s my imagination, right?
I did that on purpose.
Hey, hey, wake up.
… Waaahhhh! Stop it, Sylvia, don’t come near me! Or I’ll kill you!!
Hey, calm down. Don’t worry, I won’t do anything weird. The Crimson Demons have retreated, so I’ll let you go now. After all, you let me off once before.
This is the entrance to the underground warehouse of the Crimson Demon village, which is the place they sealed the ‘weapon that might destroy the world’.
… What is that?
You’re a smart man, you should be able to guess it, right? ‘Barrier Killer’– If I gave you this hint, you should be able to understand.
Your group kept trying to infiltrate this place to steal that weapon, right?
Correct. There’s a powerful magic item placed inside that warehouse. According to rumors, it’s a nemesis of the people in this village.
However, I heard that the seal is unique and no one can open it. Also, no one can understand how to use that weapon.
Hmm? No problem, the magic item I have with me is an extremely powerful barrier killer in the demon world. It can even break the seals of the gods… Huh? T-This is odd…
The magic item isn’t reacting at all! This seal isn’t magical in nature, just what…! What, what should I do…?
‘Konami code’…? What does it mean, it wants me to input the Konami code?
You, you can read the ancient language?
No, this is a language from my country. The Konami code is a cheat code everyone knows, and it’s asking me to enter the code here…
You’re really a man beyond my expectations; to think you can undo the seal neither I nor the Crimson Demons could break…
I-I’m also an adventurer, don’t think that I’ll submit to the Demon King’s army so easily. You saw that Archpriest earlier, she can use resurrection, so it’s useless to threaten to take my life…
Violence isn’t the only way to pry open the mouth of someone, all right? Hehe, my skills are on par with succubi; I wonder how long you can last in such ecstasy?
… Really, can you even call yourself a man?Sigh, never mind, time’s short. It’s dark in there, I wonder what’s in front?
Hmm? Did they turn off the lights when they were running away? No choice, although my night vision isn’t too good in total darkness…
Hey, do you have anything that can be used as a light source…?
Eh?
–? –! ––!!
Kazuma! Are you all right? Where’s Sylvia?
You came too late, I locked Sylvia inside with an elegant counter attack. It seems that the door can’t be opened from the inside. Let’s leave her in there for a couple of weeks, that should tame her a little.
You, you trapped her in there? Guess that’s fine, she probably can’t activate the weapon. No one knows how to, after all. Still, to think Sylvia could undo that seal…
T-To lock a Demon King’s General inside… Such, such a cruel way of fighting…
To capture Sylvia that escaped from our hands so many times, way to go outsider!
This gang of people have already taken down three generals of the Demon King’s army. Defeating Sylvia is nothing strange.
Hey Kazuma, isn’t that the place with the dangerous weapon? Is it really fine trapping that damn transvestite in there?
It’s fine, it’s fine, even we can’t comprehend how to use it; it’s impossible for Sylvia to understand.
Yeah, that’s right. If Sylvia can activate the weapon, I’ll walk one round around the village on my hands.
All right, let’s go have a drink.
… Hey, are they doing that on purpose? Are the Crimson Demons full of people who won’t feel happy unless they get into trouble? Will they feel uneasy if they don’t raise such flags?
Do-Don’t say that; I won’t deny that the Crimson Demons like to find trouble, but it’ll be fine this time. See, it’s getting quiet in there, maybe she suffocated?
Hmm? … Hey Kazuma, can you feel the ground shaking?
Hey, this is bad! I have a bad feeling about this! Let’s get out of here and…!
What are you scheming, Kazuma? We managed to take out the Demon King’s general, right? Hey, even though Kazuma did it alone, we’re a team, so we should split the bounty, right? Hehe, what should I buy with Sylvia’s bounty money?
You dumbass, why must you always raise a flag? Hey Megumin, Darkness! Let’s retreat! No, we should get the Crimson Demons to send us back to Axel…!
Ah, hahaha! You’ve got guts, boy! You think I came here just to steal the weapon? My name’s Sylvia! As you can see–
I’m a Demon King’s general that can combine with weapons and the like! Growth Chimera Sylvia!
It’s the ‘Mage Killer’! She absorbed the ‘Mage Killer’!
Ahhh, oh no Kazuma! Things are a mess! Let’s run away, now, immediately, run!
Hey, that’s the Mage Killer!
Abandon the village! It’s hopeless!
Teleport!
Hey Megumin, explain it to me! What’s a Mage Killer? Is it really that scary? Is that the weapon that might destroy the world?
The weapon that might destroy the world shouldn’t be like that…! However, the thing Sylvia combined with was equally dangerous, something called a ‘Mage Killer’…!
It’s something that’s completely immune to magic, the nemesis of the Crimson Demons. A weapon that specializes in killing mages!
The village is burning…
By the way, how did Sylvia break that seal?
Did she use a magic item to break the barrier? But no matter what kind of barrier destruction item it may be, it shouldn’t work on that seal…
No matter what it is, we can only abandon this village. It’s frustrating to let the Demon King’s army get its way, but we can always make a comeback if we still have our lives.
Hey Megumin, is there really no way to fight that Mage Killer?
As explained earlier, as the name implies, Mage Killer’s a weapon specializing in exterminating mages. It’s immune to magic. I heard that when the Mage Killer went on a rampage long ago, our ancestors used another weapon that was sealed away to destroy it. After overcoming that crisis, they repaired the Mage Killer as a memento and sealed it again…
Why did they repair such a dangerous thing? …No, wait, you said that there’s a weapon that can fight the Mage Killer?
… Kazuma, unfortunately no one knows how to use the weapon that can fight the Mage Killer. The instruction manual’s left behind, but even the village chief can’t read it…
Hmph… I’ll be the decoy and lure Sylvia away. With the support of all the Crimson Demons, I won’t die so easily.
What are you saying? Don’t you know we’re totally helpless here? Are you stupid? Even a goblin knows better than to fight a futile battle. Are you dumber than a goblin?
You, you really–! We’ll settle this after we go back to Axel! I still remember those horrible words you said to me back then! Also, I’m not doing this without any plans!
While I’m aggravating Sylvia, you and Aqua, who have night vision, can use Lurk to sneak into that destroyed underground warehouse and retrieve that whatever weapon.
… But no one knows how to use the weapon in question! Weren’t you listening?
Of course I heard. I understand that. But thinking about it the other way, won’t the problem be solved if we knew how to operate it? Acting would be better than standing idly around. Don’t worry, I don’t know what weapon that might be, but as a noble, I’m rather familiar with magic items. I even fixed my father’s magic camera by knocking it in the past.
… All right, let’s give it a shot.
I don’t hate a situation where life and death depends on one single move!
In fact, I like it! You’re outsiders, but that’s pretty cool!
Hey! The Demon King’s General is still rampaging in the village! Why are we doing something so dangerous like sneaking into the village? I don’t wanna! My specialty’s providing support to everyone from a safe spot!!
Stop messing around and come with me! I can’t sift through it all alone!
How long is this futile struggle going to last? I thought the Crimson Demons were smarter than this!
Teleport!
Stop, stop Sylvia! Please! Don’t harm her!
You all killed my subordinates too, it’s payback time! Don’t worry, not just that woman, but also you, your family–everyone and this entire village will burn! … Prepare yourself!
Run, even if it’s just you… I’ll give everything I have to fight Sylvia, so you must use this chance to run!
Sylvia, this is my trump card! Watch carefully! And…
Please, Bukkoroli… Forget about me, you must live a happy life…
Soketto! Please Sylvia, stop! Soketto, I’ll never forget you…!
You’re really resolute! Come, let me see your final trump card! No matter what spell it is, I’ll take–
Teleport!
I, I absolutely hate the Crimson Demons.
Sylvia, it’s so pitiful of you to end up like this… At least let me use my ultimate, ahhh! That burns! It’s rude to interrupt when delivering a cool line, Sylvia!
I don’t want to drag this on anymore! If you don’t want to fight, then scram!
All right, let’s go! Hey Darkness, if things look dangerous for the Crimson Demons, I’ll be counting on you! No matter how strong they are, they’re still mages; they can’t escape if they exhaust their mana.
I understand, leave it to me!
What, what should I do? I can’t use Teleport, so I can’t even stall for time…
You’re the trump card during our critical moment. The Mage Killer only has high resistance to magic, right? Advance magic might be ineffective, but no one has tried fighting it with Explosion yet, right? Maybe Explosion will be able to deal some damage to it.
Ahahaha, what’s the matter? Come on, use your teleport magic!
Damn, the chanting’s not…! Hey, things are getting dire! Sylvia’s movement is becoming more agile!
Kazuma, I’ll guard the entrance into the warehouse, so don’t worry and search inside.
You’re still speaking nonsense, come with me!
… Hey, are we going to dig through that big pile over there?
Hey Kazuma, look, look!
Isn’t that a Game Girl? What’s such an ancient game console doing in a place like this?
Since there’s a game console, there must be game cartridges. Hey, if you find Tetris, give it to me, okay? I’ll lend it to Kazuma to play too!
Did I say that I was here to find games? What I want are weapons! Where’s that weapon-like thing? … By the way, what’s with this? These are all things from Earth…
Hey Kazuma, I found something.
– O Month X day. Oh no, the secret of the facility has been discovered, but fortunately, they don’t seem to know what I was making. If they find out that I was using the national research funds to make games, I wonder how they would punish me…
– O Month X Day. A high-ranking guy entered my sanctuary and asked me the purpose of these game consoles. There’s no way I can honestly tell him it’s a toy. Thus, I made a serious face and told him that these are weapons that might destroy the world. My female colleague turned on the power supply of the game console timidly, and was startled by the sound of the console starting up. She always acts so fierce, so why was she so afraid of a game console?
– O Month X Day. They increased my research budget and asked me to create a weapon to fight the Demon King’s army. Sigh, even if you say that, it’s hard to do it. Didn’t I already create all sorts of things with the cheat powers I got after coming to this world? My contribution to the nation was already tremendous. I won’t be able to take it if you keep pushing me like that. I tried telling them with a serious face, ‘War begets nothing…’, but my female colleague slapped my head and said that I only got this job because the Demon King existed. That’s true, but a weapon to fight against the Demon King… What should I make?
– O Month X Day. I want to make a giant robot, something that can transform and combine. After I submitted my proposal, they thought I was making fun of them. I was lectured, but I was serious. Out of spite, I said that we just needed to build a huge weapon with super powerful magic resistance. Unexpectedly, that proposal was approved. What the hell, is that fine? Even if you ask me to draw a design, what should I use as reference…? Oh? There’s a stray dog right there. You then, I’ll name the dog-form weapon ‘Mage Killer’.
– O Month X Day. After I submitted the design plans, they praised it and said, ‘I see, a snake huh? Much better than something with legs. A great idea.’ Eh, I drew a dog. I know my drawing’s poor, but please look closer, this is a sausage dog… On closer inspection, I really drew a snake!
– O Month X Day. Experimentation began. Hmm, it’s moving. Although it’s moving, that thing doesn’t have spare batteries. We tried bringing it to attack the demons and found it out of battery in no time. But those fellows were scared out of their wits. Using this chance, I said, ‘This weapon’s still too early for humanity’ and sealed it here. It can’t move since it doesn’t have batteries, but it can be used as material to create chimeras as living weapons. It won’t need batteries that way, and is really cool.
– O Month X Day. The new anti-Demon King weapons were created, …well, although I called them that, they were actually modified humans. We tried recruiting volunteers who were willing to undergo modification surgery and we gathered so many that we had to choose the volunteers by drawing lots. Does this bunch really understand what modified humans are? After explaining to them that this surgery was a simple experiment to raise their suitability of being a mage to the limit, the volunteers even made strange requests like, ‘I want a pair of red eyes’, ‘I want a unique call sign’. Is everyone in this nation an idiot?
– O Month X Day. The modification surgery’s finished. Those bunch even said something stupid like, ‘Master, please bestow us with a new name’. What Master, just how far are you guys going with this? It was troublesome, so I picked a name at random. They seemed so happy, is their aesthetic sense fine? However, these guys are strong, super strong. The high-ranking people gave me plenty of praises and wanted to give me an important post. From tomorrow onward, I’ll be the director of the research and development laboratory. To be honest, I don’t want the status and would rather have more benefits. Sigh, it’s a rare chance so I’ll give those fellows a clan name. Since their eyes are so red, I’ll call them the ‘Crimson Demons’. My female colleague retorted that the name was too casual and rolled her eyes. Damn that bitch.
Hey!
Ah, sorry, please continue.
– O Month X Day. The Crimson Demons bunch kept yapping to me about creating a nemesis that could fight against them–a ‘Mage Killer’ weapon.Sigh, didn’t I already tell them that thing can’t move? Also, that wasn’t made to be your nemesis, its batteries are flat… No matter how I explained, they just wouldn’t listen. They’re already so old, and yet they’re still in their rebellious stage. I couldn’t stand them anymore, so I sloppily made a… I was thinking of making it sloppily, but somehow, I created something really powerful. This thing’s probably the real weapon that might destroy the world. Its appearance was just like a railgun, although its operation principle had nothing to do with electromagnetic acceleration. I couldn’t think of a good name, so for convenience sake, I’ll name it ‘railgun (fake)’.
– O Month X Day. The railgun (fake) was amazing, too amazing. So amazing that it scared me. It was meant to be a light weapon that compresses mana and shoots it out, but after those guys tested one shot with it, the power even surprised me. What the hell, this is scary. That might be so, but it won’t last long. It was crafted from random parts, so it’ll break after a few shots. It would be terrible if someone uses it for evil, so let’s seal it here… By the way, this thing’s rather long, just the right length for a laundry pole… Oh no, this is bad, the high authorities seemed to be encouraged by the success of the Crimson Demon project and want to invest a large amount of money to create a super-sized mobile weapon. You think it’s so easy to build such a thing? Did water get inside your brain? Never mind, it’s not my problem anyway.
The notebook ends here… Hey, I think I’ve seen this handwriting somewhere before.
By the way, didn’t you read a notebook in the mobile fortress too? Is the handwriting the same as this one?
Hey, that notebook inside the Destroyer, was it in Japanese too?
That’s right.
Right your head! Why didn’t you tell me something so important?
You didn’t ask!
Damn it, so that’s how it is! The one who created this series of messes was another cheater you sent to this world! The Mobile Fortress Destroyer and the Mage Killer were all the work of this moron! Hey you! Don’t keep sending people to this world so irresponsibly! … Ah! Wait!
… Eh, I didn’t notice this before, but– Just how old are you? Were you already a goddess before the mobile fortress was built?
… Hey Kazuma, how could you ask a goddess her age? You’ll receive divine retribution, all right? … Let me make this clear, time flows very slowly in the room you and I first met, which means my age’s different from your understanding of age. If you get it, don’t ask this question again. You’ll really receive divine retribution if you do, Satou Kazuma-san.
Tch, grandma…
What did you say? Are you kidding me, who’s a grandma? Didn’t I tell you that time passes slowly in that place, so change the way you address me! I’ve just lived a bit longer than you, ahhh!
Damn it, where’s the railgun? Since it’s long as a laundry pole, I should be able to find it immediately–!
Hey Kazuma, the time flow in Japan, heaven and this world are all different. For example, one month in Japan’s just an hour in heaven, but is several months in this world. And so, my age… Hey, are you listening?
That’s not important! We need to find the railgun! Railgun! Help me find it! It’s something as long as a laundry pole…
Hey Aqua! I understand, that weapon’s at…!
Ha, this still works, I tried using magic to substitute batteries and it really works. How many game cartridges work with this? I’ll bring as many back as I can…
Get lost!
Waaahhhh! My Game Girl!
Give it back! Return my Game Girl to me! You can’t find another one in this world! Compensate me! When we go back to Axel, compensate me with all the bounty you have! Judging by its rarity, three hundred million would be a pretty cheap price!
Are you done yet? Now’s not the time for this!! And that thing isn’t yours anyway! You’re so much older than me, so why do you keep saying such childish things?
You’ve done it now, I already said that goddesses are forever young! I’ll make you regret aggravating the goddess of water! I’ll curse you, your toilet won’t flush and your warm bath water will turn cold!
All right, now to bring this thing to the Crimson Demons… Hmm?
Isn’t that Yunyun? What’s she doing there…?
Yunyun…!
Yunyun, she…!
The daughter of the village chief Yunyun, she…!
Is the sun rising from the west? That weirdo Yunyun who doesn’t even dare introduce herself is…
… So, it’s true that your adventurer’s card doesn’t have the teleport spell… Is it a good idea to tell me voluntarily that you can’t use Teleport to escape?
Kazuma, did you find the weapon? We noticed that Komekko wasn’t at the shelter, so Yunyun volunteered to attract Sylvia’s attention. We used this chance to rescue her from the house…
It’s great that all of you are safe. I also found the weapon. By the way, what’s with Darkness? Did something happen?
I tried to lure Sylvia away… It was working well at first, but in the end, she said, ‘I can’t be bothered to fight a woman with weak attacks and tough defense’…
I understand, it couldn’t be helped. But right now, let’s find a way to rescue Yunyun…
No, we’ll only get in the way if we go now! She must’ve planned something! It’s fine, from the way the grass around the boulder was trampled, someone’s already sneaking there to save her, let’s just watch from here!
I’m Yunyun… An Archwizard… User of Advanced Magic…
The number one mage of the Crimson Demons, and the one who’ll become the village chief!
What!?
Demon King’s General, Sylvia! As the daughter of the Crimson Demon chieftain…! I’ll show you the taboo spell that’s passed on through the generations of the chieftains!
… Ugh… Ugh…!
Yunyun! Yunyun, she! Yunyun, she has finally awakened!
The daughter of the village chief, Yunyun, has finally broken out of her cocoon!
Too cool! Yunyun’s too cool!
Her powers within her have finally awakened!
That’s my student! I taught and trained her with so much care!! Well done Yunyun, you’ve used the knowledge I taught you well…!
What’s the matter? Little girl who can’t use Teleport. Little girl, aren’t you a typical Crimson Demon who merely put up a facade by saying a secret technique, certain kill, and trump cards? If not, why don’t you show me your so called ‘taboo spell’?
I won’t let you escape, I won’t let you escape, I won’t let you escape, I won’t…!
Hey…! Wait…!
Teleport!
… Fufu, hahaha! This is the strongest group of mages? Aren’t you all just bastards who can only make big talk? Everyone who’s involved with you must be third rate!
Hey Aqua, prepare to attack while her guard is down. Compress that clothes destroying spell into this thing. Our mission is just to bring this back, but we might as well go for gold!
Hoho, it’s finally time for a professional like me to take the field. No problem, leave the final attack to me!
Sacred Exorcism!
Snipe!
Hmm?
Hey, what the hell? Is it broken? Or did I leave the safety on…?
Sacred Exorcism! Sacred Exorcism!
Here, here, let me try. You can fix machines by doing this!
Hey Darkness, knock somewhere higher… Yes, right there. Maybe the mana’s stuck there.
By the way, that’s the so-called weapon? It looks like the laundry pole Chekera treats like a family heirloom… Maybe some dirt is stuck inside? Let’s clean it with something like a stick.
Hey… Hey, hey…!
What? Try casting your spell again! Maybe the spell just now isn’t compatible with the railgun, try another spell…!
Ara, ara, what are you all doing there? Hmm, what’s that? You’re holding something interesting!!
Wait a moment boy! Put that thing onto the ground slowly. It looks dangerous, that’s what my intuition as a Demon King’s General is telling me!
Wait! Really, Kazuma, your stats are so much lower than me, but why are you so fast at running away? Did you learn the ‘Escape’ skill just for this? Don’t leave me behind!
Do-don’t say I’m heavy! It’s my armor that’s heavy!
You can’t escape, Satou Kazuma! And listen up, Crimson Demons! From this day forth, I’ll be your nemesis! No matter which corner of the Earth you run to, I’ll find you all and wipe you out! I’ll crush your village no matter where you build it!
Cowardly Crimson Demons! All of you, and anyone who’s related to you, will live a life of running until the end of your days!
Big sister’s not a coward!
I can’t pretend I didn’t hear that. This is an affair between the Crimson Demons and the Demon King’s army. If Kazuma hands the weapon over, would you let the three of them go?
Ara, aren’t you that little girl with a weak sense of presence? Speaking of which, I haven’t seen you using magic yet. What kind of ‘port’ would the spell be?
I have yet to introduce myself. My name’s Megumin. Also, I’m the real number one mage of the Crimson Demons.
You’re really a unique Crimson Demon… So, you won’t introduce yourself in a weird way? For the Crimson Demons, isn’t acting cool important to you?
Big sister’s amazing! Her spell’s so powerful she even destroyed an evil god!
I’ll leave Komekko to you. A newborn calf doesn’t fear the tiger, she’ll make a lot of enemies that way. I’ll destroy that thing with my certain kill spell.
Hey!
Ara, ara, this again, certain kill magic! I’m tired of hearing that!
What’s wrong with Hyoizaburoi’s daughter? She’s always been boisterous.
She needs to build more tension if she wants to use a certain kill spell!
The opening speech is too plain, too plain!
… Hey Megumin, I have something to tell you.
Kazuma, you–
I heard from Aqua earlier… Kazuma can read the ancient language in the underground warehouse, right?
… Sorry for making you clean up after I made a mess. This time, I’ll clean up after Kazuma.
Little girl, are you done? You won’t take the initiative anyway, right? When I attack, you’ll teleport away at the right moment, right?
Hey, you guys! Get away from Sylvia! As far as you can!
As expected of Megumin’s comrade! He’s an outsider, but he knows how to set the atmosphere!
He’s pretty good… That anxious face looks like he’s being serious.
Idiots! She’s really going to use a certain kill spell now! Run away! Run away quickly!
You’re still so persistent in your fetish even under the threat of death!
To protect Komekko, I’ll just stand far away.
Certain kill spell? … I, I don’t care if it’s Blast or Detonation, it won’t harm me since I’ve merged with the Mage Killer! Try it if you don’t believe me! It’s futile, time to die…!
Explosion—!!
Huh?
Huh?
Scaring me for nothing, you little brat! Watch me tear you into pieces!
Damn it! Because of this junk, the situation became worse!
Ka-Kazuma, Sylvia’s charging this way! I’ll leave Megumin who’s exhausted her mana to you! Don’t worry about me, let me enjoy myself for a few hours before rescuing me…
Kazuma! As a goddess, protecting a frail life like Komekko is  my obligation, so I’ll make a move first!
Hey, that thing’s beeping.
Demon King’s General, Sylvia! Remember my name! Send my regards to the other generals in hell! My name’s Sa–
… Hmm? Could, could it be, that I…?
I’m Komekko! The number one demonic sister of the Crimson Demons! The one who’s stronger than a Demon King’s general!
What the hell.
… Hey Megumin, what’s with this? How is the reconstruction proceeding so fast?
What do you mean? I don’t know how long reconstruction takes in other cities, but you shouldn’t compare us to them.
… Just tell me, how long does it take to return the village back to the way it was?
Three days.
… I saw a girl saying sadly, ‘The village is burning…’ or something like that, and felt really guilty about it.
That’s strange. If it’s just a fire, it’ll be simple to rebuild. Everyone in the village should know that… What does she look like?
… That’s her.
What? You’ve some business with me, outsider? Hey, Megumin, I was just looking for you.
Hey Arue, long time no see.
Megumin, could you look at this, I just finished the ‘Legend of the Crimson Demon Hero’ chapter two. The scene about the burning of the Crimson Demon village is really descriptive; I’m really confident about it.
Hoho, let me read your masterpiece…
So, it’s you, ahhh!!
Ahhh?
Ahhh… My, my masterpiece…!! The crystallization of my efforts after staying up all week…!!
This is the first time I’ve seen Arue who’s usually cool and collected acting like this.
It’s your fault…! All because of you! Do you know how much I was looking forward to it and how happy I was? Do you know how depressed I became? Stop toying with a man’s heart!
Me-Megumin, what’s with this rude man? Doing something so mean to someone he just met! I’m really scared!
You created a series of misunderstandings that almost scared me to death! You even said something like, ‘The village is burning…’! And what was with your new work? While we were risking death in battle outside, you were snuggling at home and writing that? Do you know how much trouble I went through because of the doodling you mailed to Yunyun?
Doodling?
Hey, both of you calm down, this is the first time you’ve met, so why are you two so…? Hey! … You two! If you keep on fighting, I’ll use my super high stats to make you taste some suffering!
– Kazuma, what’s with you? You were in a good mood when all of us were having dinner, but your face looks bad after going out for a while.
What’s with me? Your ‘mixed hot spring’ is that ‘what’! Is that naming a joke? It’s not mixed gender and it’s not a hot spring, so why use such a name?
Oh, so that’s where you went. That’s one of the attractions in this village, a place all visitors should visit.
This village is too much! I can’t even take a bath without being toyed with! Really, this is the worst vacation!
I’m very satisfied with this vacation though.
… Really, I was targeted by orcs, then by Sylvia these past few days–people I’d rather not have anything to do with.
What a coincidence, me too.
I, I’m really sorry…
If Kazuma feels guilty about it, then… Right, tell me something fun. I want to hear about stories from the country Kazuma lived in.
– And so, I reacted on the spot and asked the girl next door to use the money to buy chocolate and send it to me by today. I even promised that she could keep the change. In the end, the plan proceeded smoothly, so my younger brother only got a chocolate from my mother, but I had my mother’s as well as the one bought by that girl. At this moment, the long competition between my brother and I concluded, and I defended my pride as the elder brother.
So, you hired a helper to win the battle. I’m relieved that Kazuma was like this in the past too… But that’s such a strange custom, is it really that bad to not receive any chocolate on that day?
Bad isn’t even close to describing it. If I can go back in time, I’ll kill the guy who invented such a damnable culture. That’s how pitiful any man who doesn’t receive any chocolate is. And overcoming that wasn’t the end. We have to return the favor to the girls.
… Return the favor? What’s that?
If you receive chocolates from a girl, you’ll have to give something three times as expensive to the girl one month later as thanks. That’s how evil it was. If you don’t, you would be completely shunned by the girls. You’ll be mocked if you don’t get chocolate, and even if you do, you’ll still need to break the bank. This day is that sinful and dirty.
Why didn’t you receive any chocolate? You might lack some basic manners as a person, but from my observation after spending so much time with you, you still have some good points too. For example, you’re very, very… Gentle…? No. Down to earth…? Wrong too… Hmm? … Hmm? Have your life in order? But you were in debt… Eh, how should I put this…?
Put this my ass! Work harder in stating my good points!
… Eh, you’re not very honest about it, but you’re always concerned about your comrades…? I don’t hate this part about Kazuma.
If I go to the country Kazuma lived in… When it’s Valentine’s, I’ll give you chocolates. You can show it off to your brother then.
Didn’t you hear what I said? That whatever-tines is a day when you give chocolates to someone you like. If you give chocolate recklessly just because you’re a bit close to a boy, that boy will immediately misunderstand and end up miserable. Don’t do that. If you do something like that in my country, you’ll be labeled an easy woman.
But, I do like you.
What did you just say? Please repeat it exactly again.
I don’t dislike you.
Hey, that’s different from what you said just now, you think my memory’s that poor?
Kazuma, if…
What? What is it? I’m all prepared and ready to go!
Kazuma, if it was possible…
– Do you want an excellent mage?
Ah! It’s ‘the one with azure lightning on her back’, Yunyun! Long time no see! I’m going for breakfast, want to join me?
… How popular, ‘the one with azure lightning on her back’. It’s just a meal, so why don’t you just join her?
Don’t say it! Stop using that name! Wh-why did I do something so stupid…?
Oh, it’s ‘crackling thunder’ Yunyun! I’m just going to eat…
Not going! I’m not going!!
… How popular, ‘crackling thunder’. Just let him treat you to breakfast.
No! Please don’t say it! Don’t give me weird nicknames!
What are you saying, number one mage of the Crimson Demons? You ignored me and used that name, and now you say you don’t want one, how selfish! Come, show me that cool pose again!
Do-don’t say it! Megumin’s still bothered by that? I only borrowed it for a while!
The two of you are so close.
Let’s go! The teleporter already registered the destination to Axel! We need to hurry up and get ready for the teleport!
Ah, wait for me Megumin!
Ah, Funifura, Dodonko.
It’s been a while, Yunyun and useless mage! How’ve you been?
Ahahaha! The number one genius of the Crimson Demons became the number one useless mage! You’re now the talk of the village!
Hey, your greetings are really special for meeting a classmate you haven’t met for so long!
It-it’s just a joke! Sorry, I’m sorry! It’s been so long, so why are you still so aggressive?
Stop, what’s with the strength of your grip? What level are you now, it hurts! Violence is prohibited!
… Um, you were very cool yesterday. Up until now, I’ve always thought of you as a weirdo… Many things happened too.
Yeah, I’ve changed my opinion of you too! Yunyun’s so cool!
No.
Please don’t say anymore.
The two of you are a bit off in some ways, so we were worried about you.
That’s right, Megumin acts childishly sometimes and Yunyun looks like she’d be an easy target of bad boys. But we’re relieved that the two of you are doing well.
Kazuma-san, allow me to introduce them. This is Funifura and Dodonko. During my school days, they were my… fr-friends!
How do you do? My name’s Satou Kazuma. I’m one of Yunyun’s friends and I’ve been in her care. Please take care of me too.
Ple-please take care of me too!
Hey, I understand you two don’t have a lot of chances to meet guys, but please don’t flirt with my man.
?
He-hey, what did you say…? So, you were serious when you said you liked me last night?
!!
Ma-Ma-Man? That Megumin who didn’t care about anything other than magic has a man? Is this a lie? It is right? You like him as a boyfriend?
That-That-That’s right, it must be. Megumin who isn’t concerned about such things suddenly having a man is impossible, huh?
Ka-Kazuma-san? Is this true? Me-Megumin made such a confession…
Don’t think too much about this–Kazuma already met my parents and gifted them with snacks. We’ve even bathed together before and had been sharing the same bed and blanket with our bodies rubbing against each other. That’s how simple our relationship is.
!!
…Pfft.
!!
… Wah, wahhh! So-so what if you have a man, ahhh!
I-I’m not envious! I’m not envious at all, ahhh!
Yunyun, there’s a place I want to go with Kazuma. Sorry, but can you go ahead and ask the teleporter to get ready?
Huh? That, that’s… Um, I can do that…! So, you two are really…?
Even if one of us found a boyfriend, we’ll still be friends forever!
Wah, wahhh! You normally won’t say I’m a friend! I don’t feel like I lost to Megumin at all!!
Kazuma… I asked you yesterday, and I’ll ask you again. You want an excellent mage, right?
If you asked if I want one, then the answer is yes, of course.
Is that so… Hmm, I made up my mind.
I plan to start learning advanced magic.
… Hey, what did you say?
I’ve been feeling troubled, even before Yunyun said I was a useless mage. Maybe I wouldn’t have considered such things if I never met you, Aqua, and Darkness, and kept on raising my Explosion level. It’s evident from meeting Funifura and Dodonko that everyone in the village of the Crimson Demons must be utterly disappointed in me… I won’t be a burden for you anymore. I’ll be of help to you and everyone… So, that’s why, from this day forth, I’ll seal my explosion magic.
Hey, wait a minute. While it’ll be a big help if you can use advanced magic, there’s no need to seal away your explosion magic. We won’t be doing quests every day, so you can cast your explosion spell every day if you’re free. Also, instead of using it every day, it can be a trump card during crucial moments…! And didn’t you tell Yunyun earlier that you put all your skill points into increasing the power of Explosion and raising the chanting speed?
You remember it well. To learn this skill at any moment, I had been saving up my precious skill points… After chanting Explosion and exhausting my mana, I won’t be able to use other spells for the day. On the other hand, if I use advanced magic, I won’t be able to use Explosion which requires all my mana. When I learn advanced magic, I need to keep on casting it to increase my proficiency, and I would need to keep on practicing it.
At the destination of thy journey, there’ll be a time when thy comrade shares their doubts and approaches thee for advice. That comrade will change her path according to thy words. Thou should consider it carefully and give an advice thy won’t regret.
Sorry, Kazuma. Can I ask you to do something mean?
… You can’t press the button to learn advanced magic yourself, so you want me to help you press it, right?
How about thinking over it again? We already got a huge sum of money in the bank, right? We don’t need to do dangerous quests anymore. We can live a carefree life in that mansion, you can wipe out some small fries with Explosion every now and then, and all of us can live happily ever after.
When I said I didn’t plan to learn intermediate magic last time, Kazuma kept nagging me about it.
… You won’t regret this?
I won’t. I don’t want to be a burden anymore. If I’m a normal Crimson Demon, Kazuma won’t be chased by orcs and be forced into tears… Sylvia wouldn’t have been able to kidnap Kazuma, either… I’m the number one mage of the Crimson Demons, the one who wields the power of advanced magic! … I’ll say that from now on. I have more mana than Yunyun, so if I can use advanced magic, I’ll be the strongest mage of the Crimson Demons. I won’t let Yunyun take my number one spot.
It’s about time to go back to the others! Together with Aqua and Darkness, let’s go back to Axel. Oh right, the bounty for Sylvia’s really high, right?
Hmm, is that so? Let’s go back and have a party then.
Oh, that’s right. Megumin, try casting an explosion spell.
… You’re really… I just steeled myself, and not five minutes later, you want me to cast Explosion? Just what are you thinking?
From where I was from, there’s a saying ‘I’ll work hard tomorrow.’ Also, I’ve yet to see a one-hundred-point Explosion from you. The Explosion that defeated Sylvia borrowed the power of the weapon too. Are you fine with your final Explosion being so lackluster?
… You really don’t hold back, do you? All right, this will be my final Explosion spell. I’ll show you a powerful shot!
… Wait, Me-Megumin. Hold on. Don’t aim so close, set your target further away. You’ll be giving it your all for this ultimate blow, right? Then aim at that boulder over there.
I don’t mind, but that’s barely within my range … Well then, let me show you my full power final Explosion!
Explosion–!!
I’m Megumin! The number one mage in Axel, an Archwizard that uses Explosion, and the one who’ll reach the peak of Explosion Magic!
How many points was that Explosion?
One hundred and twenty points.
My own home’s the best after all! I don’t want to go on any more trips for now! Something’s wrong if a hikikomori like me keeps traveling around!
Really Kazuma, showing your bum nature immediately. But for some reason, seeing you like this makes me feel at ease. It’s like I don’t need to work hard anymore.
Aqua, you’re just relieved after seeing your own kind! Don’t be depraved and learn that guy, he’s a negative example!
Don’t say that. In the end, Kazuma performed quite admirably this time. He deciphered the ancient language and found out how to use the weapon. He even defeated Sylvia.
We only defeated Sylvia because of Megumin’s power. I merely directed it.
No, no, if not for the weapon that converts magic into pure destructive power, I wouldn’t be of much use. This is all thanks to Kazuma who brought the weapon there.
… Hey Aqua, what’s with the two of them? I think something’s different about them after the trip… Co-could it be, when they were sleeping in the same bed, they…?
Hey, don’t talk nonsense, I didn’t do anything wrong! Hey Megumin, we didn’t… Hey, deny it properly! They’ll become suspicious!
When did you bring the game console back? Hey, let me play too, this item is most suited for a gamer like me!
If you want to borrow it, you need to pay the price! Specifically speaking, clean the bathroom for me tomorrow!
Excuse me, is anybody there?
Is someone there… Oh, greetings sir. Are you the owner of this mansion…? What, what are you doing sir! Stop…!
I don’t know where you came from, but it’s probably some troublesome problems! Go back, you harbinger!
Kazuma, use Drain Touch! Suck his life force and knock him out! Then throw him outside and pretend he never came here!!
What are the both of you doing suddenly? Hey Kazuma! Stop it!
I can empathize with you on why you don’t want to get involved with any trouble, but you can’t assault someone you just met!
What, aren’t you Hagen? Didn’t I tell you to not come to this mansion unless there’s an emergency? I’m not worried about you giving me trouble, rather, like just now– I was afraid that you’ll suffer inhumane treatment…
Young lady, naturally, I’m here for a matter of grave importance. Actually…
No, don’t wanna! This has nothing to do with me, so don’t make me listen, don’t involve me! I don’t want to go anywhere or go near danger! I want to safely stay at home!
I’m concerned about the hygiene of the toilet after the trip, I’ll go clean it!
What’s the matter? Did something happen at home?
It’s really terrible young lady! If this goes on, your only good point will disappear!
Hey, wait, what happened to Darkness’s only good point? Is it sagging? Is her slutty body going to sag? I’ve always found it strange, her body’s way too sexy! She must’ve used her money and authority to get magic items that make her boobs big!
What are you talking about? My strong point would be defense… That’s not it! Hagen, you’re too mean, I should have more strong points…! Say it Megumin, Aqua, I should have other strong points too, right?
Instead of that, does the breast enlargement magic item exist? If there is, please…
Kazuma and the old man are too mean! Our Darkness has many good points! She’s soft hearted and agrees to anything if you plead to her in tears. She believes everything that you teach her, so it doesn’t get boring-ow ow ow! Stop it Darkness, my head’s going to explode! I’m praising you, so what are you doing?
That’s wrong! If this goes on, the old master might be stripped of his nobility and the young lady will become a peasant! The unworldly young lady will only be able to make a living by selling her slutty body– Young lady! Please don’t do that to my old bones, I’ll die!
…? What’s this?
It’s a letter from the royal palace. Young lady, after you read it, you’ll understand the crisis impending on House Dustiness. And this is related to Satou-san over there…
… What’s it about?
No-no-nothing at all! This has nothing to do with Kazuma-sama! Please don’t mind it!
Show me the letter.
No, I refuse. No, I apologize for dragging you in every time. Hey, that’s what you said, right? You don’t want to be involved in troublesome matters anymore! And so, this matter–
Steal!
Ah!
Kazuma, let’s reject this invitation! If anything happens to first princess Iris, we’ll lose our heads! It’ll be a big problem if one of us did anything rude! You know nothing about ceremony and etiquette, right? You hate such restrictive events, right? Am I right? Let’s reject it! Yes, that’s right, the Dustiness house will book a good restaurant and we’ll only invite close friends to hold a party that commemorates your achievements! So…!
Our time has finally come!
… Kazuma, do you want to go on a date with me?
Give me a moment, I’ll go put on a change of clothes.
E-Eh, wait, hold on, I know it’s weird for me to be saying this, but aren’t you going to ask any questions?
What kind of questions do you want me to ask?
Such as… Why am I suddenly asking you on a date, or something like that.
…? Isn’t that because you are entering puberty and have started to see me, the closest male to you, as a potential mate?
Do you take me for a dog or a cat or something!? I don’t think anything of you at all!… S-Sorry, that might have been a little too far. No, it’s not like I hate you or anything!
… Then what is it? Don’t tell me you lost a bet with Aqua and the others and are asking me out as a punishment? If that’s the case, I’m going to strip all of you bare.
No, that’s not it! The truth is, there’s a reason for this…
Oh, Megumin, the weather sure is great today… Isn’t this the perfect weather for a date?
It’s cloudy and the winds are strong. Can’t you speak more naturally? … Also, can you not hold my hand so tightly? Your palms are all sweaty…
I can’t help it! It’s my first date! The last time I held a girl’s hand was back in grade school! Even if it’s just you, I’ll still be a little nervous!
‘Even if it’s just you? A little nervous?’ What’s with that!? How rude can you be!? And you’re being too loud! What if he hears you?! Also, what’s a grade school?
If you get nervous from holding hands, then this should make things easier.
So, is he following us?
Yeah, he is. Right now he’s hiding behind the butcher’s sign and looking at us.
I didn’t expect there to be a deviant weird enough to be stalking you…
Hey, what do you mean by deviant? Why don’t you explain it to me?
Right, let me do my best to act lovey-dovey with you.
We are just pretending! Y-You know that, right? Don’t go too far!
— Idiot, sharing a single drink is a staple for couples, isn’t it?
I know, I get that! But the normal way to do so would be to use two straws, not drink directly from it… Ah, you drank it all! How could you!? I was the one who bought this drink!
—You can probably get in with a children’s ticket, so let’s buy some popcorn with the money we save.
Wait a moment, that might be true, but I feel like an important part of me will die if I do that… Ah! Look, Kazuma, look at this! Let’s watch this play! ‘Putamkin punches through all troubles’! Be it strife, civil war, corruption, or famine, watch the legendary nobleman Putamkin punch his way through all of it- A jolly martial arts play starring Baron Putankin!
Oh, yeah, I was really curious about that too, but it’s not really a play suitable for a date…
– I really didn’t expect Baron Putamkin to break that heirloom vase that he risked his life to retrieve!
Yeah! And I definitely didn’t expect the princess to be punched just as she was saying that her brothers would no longer have any reason to fight over the vase now!
I really didn’t expect the princess to be mastermind behind it all! At first, I thought the protagonist was a crazy nutjob who just punches everyone he sees!
Actually, historians are still studying Baron Putamkin! There are a lot of people who think that he simply punches people based off his instincts without thinking even or investigating matters, but most historians agree that there’s no way that anyone could be that crazy…
—The baron said ‘meat is justice!’, so I think we should follow his words and go grab some meat!
On this day, we should be eating eel! It’s Redemption Day today, the day when the Baron defeated the Eight-Headed Eel with his fists and used its meat to end the famine and the bounty to solve the financial problems plaguing the country!
Then let’s decide it with rock-paper-scissors.
There’s no way I can beat you in rock-paper-scissors! We are on a date, so you should listen to the girl at times like this!
Going on a date to ask the guy to buy you expensive eel meat, you’re just taking advantage of a woman’s privilege!
–So, is he still following us?
I can’t see him now, though we didn’t do anything that would’ve seemed couple-like…
Well, we should head back. Even if he’s still following us, he should give up once he sees us going back to the same mansion together.
The date isn’t over yet.
… Seriously, ending our date with an Explosion trip? This doesn’t feel romantic at all.
What’s the big deal? This is what a date between us should be like. I really enjoyed myself today.
Megumin-sensei, please… Please teach me Explosion magic!
Eh?
Huh, what’s going on? You’re the guy who’s been following Megumin all this time, right? Isn’t that because you are in love with her?
Huh? Stop joking around. The ones I like are the older, onee-san types. Even I have the right to choose who I fall in love with, you know? The reason I was following Megumin-sensei around is because I was taken by the splendour of Explosion, that’s all.
Yeah, of course~ Isn’t this great, Megumin? Now you have a disciple. Yeah, I thought it was odd for there to be someone weird enough to stalk Megumin. There’s a limit to how deviant a person’s tastes can get…
Listen closely… Don’t make any sudden moves, just slowly back away. And if you hear that, don’t even look, just run.
What can I do for you, Kazuma-dono.
May I trouble you to prepare some coffee to freshen me up, Sebastian?
It’s Heidel.
Thank you, Heidel.
… Kazuma’s been grinning by himself disgustingly for a while now. Well, it is spring now, so it can’t be helped if he turns dumb.
I want a younger sister.
Hey Darkness, we have to take turns, all right? I’m next, right? I will be the one to defeat the final boss.
No, wait, didn’t Aqua and Megumin take out bosses in real life? At least let me finish it in the game.
No, as a Crimson Demon, I won’t back down on the issue of dealing the final blow. And the final boss is definitely a powerful foe. If we let the bumbling Darkness do it, we will need to try several times again before defeating it.
Listen to me ahhhhh!
Waahhhhh! Stop it, we’re about to beat the game! Everybody spent so much time to finally reach this stage!
Here, I beat the boss with no damage! Are you happy now?
Not at all!! Why did you snatch it at the most crucial part!! How are you going to compensate all the effort we spent to reach this stage? It took us three whole days to make it here!
Shut up, just give me the game again. It will take me about three hours to arrive to the same point with no damage.
Stop, no! Don’t trample over our efforts!
I thought your performance at the Crimson Demons village wasn’t bad, but deep inside, you’re still a jerk! Does mocking our efforts make you happy? Megumin, say something too!!
… Eh, well, he was the only one excluded, so that’s kind of pitiful for him. At the Crimson Demon Village or in the past, Kazuma would always be dependable at the very end. What happened just now was sort of like our style, right?
Eh?
Wait, Megumin, what’s wrong? You’re usually the first to pounce on Kazuma. What happened to the most violent delinquent in Axel?
Yeah, Megumin looks as if she has the most potential of taking the top-tier job ‘Berserker’ out of everyone here; there’s no way she would act like this. Hey Kazuma, what exactly happened in the Crimson Demon village?
The two of you are too rude! I’m an Archwizard, known for calmness and maturity!… Anyway Kazuma, what’s with you all of a sudden? If you want a sister, instead of discussing with us, you should ask your parents, right?
I already told my parents plenty of times that I want a younger sister. And it must be a sister that is not related to me by blood, so they need to hurry up and divorce, and remarry with someone that has a daughter. That was the first time my parents beat me up.
They must be wonderful parents not to have chased out a son who said something like that.
Nevermind about my parents! I can’t even go back to my country anyway, so there’s no point talking about them. The important thing is –!
The healing type big sister Wiz, the energetic girl Chris, the cold big sister type Sena, and the unlucky type Yunyun! There’s even the orthodox main heroine Eris-sama– I have met all types of beauties!
Kazuma-san Kazuma-san, what about me? What type of beauty am I?
You’re a complementary type or a pet type. Come on, this is the crucial part, so leave that till later!
… I realized something important. It is not complete yet. In the country I was born in, Japan, I sort of have a childhood friend too… So, you understand what else is missing?
… You really are hopeless. So what you’re saying is, you want me to fill the role of your sister?
What are you talking about? Megumin, you’re the loli type.
Eh?
Um, what type of beauty am I…
You’re the one in charge of the erotic stuff.
Lewdness?
You see, when we went to the Crimson Demon village, didn’t Megumin have a little sister? I felt back then that I should have a little sister too… You all know what I’m saying?
Not at all.
The Princess… seemed to be younger than me, so maybe she is a younger sister type…
… Hey Kazuma. It’s not too late to reject the invitation! Okay? The other party is one of the heads of the kingdom! It might be a meal together, but it won’t go as you expected. It will definitely be boring! All right? Everyone, just ignore this invitation!
… You must be thinking that we’ll do something rude in the presence of the Princess, right?
Hey, look me in the eyes, don’t use honorifics you’re not used to, and say it again. You’re worried that we’ll make some mistakes that would tarnish the reputation of the Dustiness family, right?
Is that right? You’re too much, Darkness! We know when to behave ourselves!
Unbelievable! Darkness, you think we’ll do anything that’ll be detrimental to you? We’re comrades! Please trust us a bit more!
Ug… Ughhh… To be honest, I know you all too well, that’s why I’m worried…
I know our difference in status and am aware of the basic etiquettes. I’m just excited to see a lady from high society, that’s all.
Hey hey, I’m a lady from high society too!
That’s right, I need to buy a tuxedo. You all don’t have dresses, right? Let’s go and tailor some.
Great idea! I want to wear something other than a Hagoromo too! But can they complete it in time?
I want a black gown, of course. Something that has an air of maturity.
You, you guys… She is the Princess of a kingdom, you know? You might lose your heads if you say anything wrong! Kazuma, warn them too…
Come to think of it, a tuxedo is too common. All right, to leave a good impression on the Princess, I’ll make a set of Kimono and Hakama…
Please, I’ll do anything! I’ll do anything I can, so don’t wear something weird to the event!
Well then, the week before the princess and her entourage arrives–since you went that far, I’ll leave all the household chores to you.
… I, I understand. I’m serious about what I said in the Crimson Demon village. It seems that I’ve underestimated you.
At a time like this, you should say, ‘As you wish, master.
… Um … Ugh!! As, as you wish, master! I’m a dirty sow…!!
I didn’t tell you to go that far.
So, what should I do? To be honest, I’ve never done household chores before, so I don’t know where to start. Anyway, should I spill tea onto your pants right between the legs, and then rush over in a panic to wipe it?
Don’t brew tea anymore in the future.
Er, just clean up the place for now. Don’t wash the plates and cutleries, you’ll probably break them. I’ve had enough of losing money in such cliche scenes.
… Eh… As you wish…
Hyaahhh!
I’m very sorry master! I broke master’s important vase! No matter what kind of punishment it is, I…!
I don’t have any vase and wouldn’t treat some shoddy vase like a treasure, but if you break something important to me, I’ll punish you by making you wear that maid costume to the adventurer’s guild.
?
… Ugh, you’ve always been of scant use, but you just have to pick this moment to clean it so thoroughly…! I wanted to pick a bone with you and order the Crusader Lalatina to parade around the adventurer’s guild in maid attire as punishment.
Fufu, I won’t be punished so easily. You’re still the guy who can guess what I hate the most… And please, stop calling me Lalatina.
… Ugh, I thought you would mix up the salt and sugar…!
If I read the labels carefully, I won’t make such a mistake. And as an adventurer, I can still do simple tasks like cooking meat.
Hmph, I used high quality meat. How’s the taste?
Average.
?
… Um, is there really a need to clean the toilet?
… Pr-Probably not.
– Really? Is this really the most important job of a maid? You’re not bullying me because I’m unworldly? At least, my father didn’t ask the maids employed in my house to do this!
It’s true! In my country, maids who don’t do this aren’t fit to be maids!
Hey, your smile’s too stiff! Why do you look so unfriendly? How scary! Give a cuter smile and say, ‘Welcome home!’.
W-Welcome home master!
Wrong! Your hands should be like this! Legs like that! Lean forward to emphasize your body parts! Isn’t your only strong point your erotic body? Quick, again!
Welcome home master! I might like to be teased, but if you go too far, my other strong point, my grip strength, will…!
Ahhh, it’s breaking, my head’s going to explode! Something’s coming out! I’m sorry!!
Seriously. If the punishment or bullying were more exciting for me, I wouldn’t mind doing it to you.
You might say that now, but you’ll shirk away just before crossing the last line.
However, you’re not too opposed to the maid costume. You should try wearing more frilly clothes sometimes.
… I know very well whether cute clothes suit me. That’s why, I want to wear casual clothes when doing house chores tomorrow…
I won’t give in on that.
Yo, sorry for the intrusion.
Ah, welcome, Kazuma-san! We’re just bringing in the fire-starting item invented by Kazuma-san!
Kazuma, Kazuma, quick, show me the power of this magic item!
This isn’t a magic item, I told you that this is a convenient tool from my country! Here, watch carefully.
Oh?
This, this is very convenient! Really, it’s just like tinder magic! Kazuma-san, this will definitely sell!
The structure’s simple, but it’s unexpectedly useful. It’s hard to believe this isn’t a magic item. And if you use it sparingly, it’ll last a long time.
I want one too. Flintstones don’t work well in wet places, and starting a fire wastes a lot of time too. Bringing flammable materials to start a fire’s troublesome, and keeping it dry is also a pain. This will solve all the problems I mentioned. Wiz, Kazuma, can you sell me one? How much is it?
No need. After all, this is something Kazuma-san invented; we merely produced it. Everyone helped with the development of the merchandize too. Please pick one you like.
Really, what a bunch of hillbillies. Being happy over a lighter. It’s easy to make something like this. That’s why people who are behind the times…
… What’s with you, Kazuma? Let me pick one too.
No, pay for it first.
Ahhh? Why, why are you only mean to me? Wiz already said she’s giving them to us! Why’s it fine for Darkness and Megumin but not me, don’t just exclude me!
I’d be fine with it if you didn’t mock the three of them. Anyway, you were completely uninvolved in this, right? Wiz is the shopkeeper, Megumin shared with me her knowledge of how the Crimson Demons craft magic items, and Darkness introduced me to a lot of merchant wholesalers. While all this was happening, didn’t you just stay in the mansion eating and sleeping and eating again? If you want a share, then go outside and attract some customers.
Wahhh! Kazuma, you unfair fellow! And I was thinking about keeping the fact that you sniff our laundry a secret!
Hey wait! I-I didn’t do that! Don’t talk such nonsense, hey! … Really! Megumin, Darkness, don’t look at me like that… Wait, why’s Wiz doing that too? No, I’m being framed!
… If I attract lots of customers, can you give me one?
Fine, I will! And resolve this misunderstanding before you go!
… But, this is an amazing amount of people.
… True.
… It would be great if all of them are customers here to buy the merchandize…
… True.
… E-Even customers who were planning to visit us had been drawn over to her…
Dammit! Ahhh, what the hell’s that girl doing!
Next, from this piece of normal handkerchief! Suddenly, pigeons will fly out!
Uuooohh?
That’s too many! What, how did she do it? This is physically impossible!
Who, who knows… I didn’t feel any mana, so it shouldn’t be summoning magic, and it’s not possible to hide the pigeons anywhere… Eh, so how did she…?
Ah, please don’t throw money. I’m not a busker, so no money please.
What, what’s with this terrible sight…?
Next, I’ll count to three and all these potions will disappear without a trace! Even I won’t know where it’ll go! Let’s start counting!
Don’t do that, thee imbecile!! What in the heavens art thee doing? Art thee not satisfied with sprinkling holy water on the handles of our shop? Art thee finally disrupting moi business openly?
Don’t get in my way you odd masked man! This is a public road; do you have any problem with me performing here?
Of course, thee twat! Moi bet the future of this shop on this day that commemorates the sale of our new products! Moi don’t have time for thee to obstruct moi business!
Dear customers, we have plenty of convenient items in stock! Please have a look!
Come, come, welcome! Customers who make purchases amounting to ten thousand eris will receive a Vanir doll that laughs at night as a gift! Customers who make purchases five hundred thousand eris and above, be amazed–! Thou shalt receive a Vanir mask that’s similar in design to mine as a complimentary gift! … Ara, young boy, moi mask isn’t for sale. Sorry, take this shiny card with you … This way, welcome!
Thank you for your patronage, thank you for your patronage! Ah, two lighters and a Vanir mask, right? Thank you for your patronage!
Let me go, Darkness! He’s implying I’m stealing his customers, this is so vexing! Let me perform!
Calm down Aqua, you forgot your objective! Here, be a good girl and come here!
Fuhahaha! Moi can’t stop laughing at this situation! Look, it’s still some ways to go before the shop closes, but the merchandize is almost sold out. Allow moi to thank thee once again, brat who enjoyed a great atmosphere with your companion during the trip, but feels uneasy because there wasn’t any development at all in the end!
Hey, are you talking about me? Is it really me? D-Don’t joke with me, I-I-I’m not uneasy, not at all! W-What, Megumin, don’t keep glancing my way!
I-I’m not glancing, not at all! Don’t waver Kazuma, how can you be so fooled by this devil’s lies!
It’s fine if thou two get married and make babies, but it’s annoying to see the two of thou stealing glances at each other. So just go to an inn or somewhere dark and get it down– Hmm, instead of that.
If this goes on, the three hundred million eris thou deserve will be ready by the end of the month. This isn’t much, but consider this a compensation from moi for making thee wait for so long.
This is one of the top sellers in our shop, a mass-produced Vanir mask that’s really popular in society. If you wear it in a moonlit night, your mana will increase, your metabolism will enhance, and your skin will have a silky luster because of the mysterious power of the devil. This is a rare black mask among these products, so you can flaunt it to the kids.
And so, all of you understand, right?
Of course. This is a rare chance. I won’t embarrass Darkness, so let me use the party trick I’ve been holding back all this while to hype up the crowd! … Kazuma, I want to take a tiger out from a hat, but there isn’t one. Using a Rookie Killer as a replacement will do, so can you catch one for me?
I’ll use an extravagant appearance in the style of the Crimson Demons to give the princess a pleasant surprise. Kazuma, I’ll need something that’ll produce lots of smoke and fire powder. Where should I buy these?
Satou Kazuma-sama and ladies. We’re honored by your visit. Today, I, Dustiness ford Lalatina, will be your hostess. Please treat this as your own home and enjoy yourselves.
T-Thank you…
Hey Darkness, stop laughing and lead the way. These clothes are uncomfortably tight.
Everyone, this way please.
– Please wait here for a moment. The young lady’s choosing the dresses.
Darkness, the waist is really loose. Is there one that’s tighter?
That, that piece has the slimmest waist… It can’t be helped, Crusaders need muscles…! What’s the matter, Megumin?
… How should I put this… It slipped right off. The waist and chest are too loose. Is there anything smaller…?
Well, I do have others… But that one was from when I was a child… Ow-ow-ow! Megumin, don’t pull my braid!
…Gasp
Kazuma, look, look. How is it? This is what it means by ‘clothes make the man’.
Really Kazuma, with so many beauties before you, you won’t lose anything by complimenting and worshipping us a little, right?
Yeah, it’s very pretty. But the important thing is still the princess. She’s been here since yesterday, huh?
… I’m serious, don’t do anything rude, all right? After all, you tend to blurt out incredible things sometimes. As an adventurer who fights constantly as a career, you’ll be given more leeway, but you might still lose your head if you say the wrong things.
Hey, let me say this first. I really don’t want to leave this mansion. I’ve lived here for so long and really like it here, but… If the princess were to ask me to be on her escort team or something, I’ll consider moving out. So, all of you should prepare yourselves mentally.
How did things go so far? Didn’t I tell you it’s just a normal dinner?
Okay, listen well. She’s a princess of a nation… Kazuma, you might have many flaws, but you still have common sense, so I won’t need to worry about you too much. And I even dressed up like a maid and served you, so don’t think you can get away if you screw this up. Aqua, don’t go overboard with your performing, especially those dangerous ones. Those tricks are banned. And Megumin… I’ll search you right now!
Eh? Wait, wait a minute Darkness, why just me? What’s there to search, we even changed in the same room…! Ahhh, wait, Kazuma’s looking! Kazuma’s using the chance to stare at me!
What trickery are you going to show?
What do you mean by trickery? How rude. It’s a rare chance to meet with royalty, but it’s boring just for the princess to see this. I planned to make a painting on the spot… Specifically, a sand painting. I would then gift it to her.
Huh. You really know all sorts of things…
Hah, see! What’s this, Megumin? A smoke bomb to disperse monsters and a potion that’ll explode once it’s opened! What are you planning to do with these? That’s why your chest’s so suspiciously big!
You’re pretty good Darkness, but I still have a second and third way of making a grandiose introduction…!
… Will we be implicated too…?
… Well then, we’re going now. Listen, I’ll handle Her Highness Iris, all of you just need to eat and nod. I’ll explain everything to her.
Sorry for the wait, Princess Iris. These are my friends and my adventuring comrades, Satou Kazuma and his team. This way, my friends. This is the first princess of the kingdom, Her Highness Iris. Please introduce yourselves with the adequate etiquette.
I’m an Archpriest, Aqua. Please to meet you… All right, allow me to present a performance as a greeting…
E-Excuse for a moment, Princess Iris. I have something to tell my companion…
Lowly plebeian, don’t leer at royalty with such lewd eyes. Normally, it’d be impossible for you to meet and dine together with royalty because of the difference in status. Lower your head, don’t meet my eyes. Hurry up with your greetings and tell me about your adventures… The princess said.
Change.
Your Highness Iris, please wait for a moment! My comrades are tense because of their excitement, allow me to speak with them for a moment…!
Y-you idiot! What the hell is ‘change’? Why do you think I suffered through all that humiliation to serve you? This isn’t what we agreed on!
‘What the hell’ and ‘not what we agreed on’ should be my lines! All those talks about the princess filled me with expectations, but what’s all this? The development I was looking forward to being was… ‘I yearn for the world outside! Brave adventurer-sama, please allow me to hear your tales of adventures!’ What kind of dining together is this? Are they looking down on me?
Hey, shut up now…! Ughh, why’s everyone pulling on my hair today…? Um… No-not in a place like this, these types of things should be done when the two of us are alone…!
By the way, something seemed to be happening. Is it fine to leave her alone?
To commemorate the day we meet the princess, I present you with this. I even replicated the disgraceful bit of sauce at the corner of the lips perfectly…
Your Highness Iris, I’ll chase this insolent fool out, please wait a moment!!
Because the princess saw the rare sight of the calm and quiet Lalatina acting so frantically, she won’t pursue the matter. It’s normal for adventurers to be a little crude. Instead of that, hurry up and tell your stories of adventure, the princess said.
My deep apologies, Princess Iris! How should I put this, the three of them are also the most problematic bunch amongst the adventurers!
For you.
To draw such a perfect sand painting in so little time…! Amazing, simply amazing! A reward for you! The princess said.
Are you the one the brave magic sword user Mitsurugi mentioned? Let me hear your story, Her Highness said… I also want to hear about how you defeated that Mitsurugi.
I had a stroke of inspiration and set a trap. I undid the seal to lock Sylvia inside! And so, I managed to buy time for the Crimson Demons to regroup!
Amazing! I’ve heard of all sorts of adventuring stories, but you’re the first person I know of that fights like this! Also, this is the first time I’ve heard such a touching story full of surprises! The stories of the other adventurers simply detailed how they elegantly wiped out the monsters, or how he defeated the dragon on the mountain with just a sword… The stories told so far were amazing, but they were all how the heroes defeated the monsters one-sidedly…! That’s what Her Highness said.
… Really, that guy’s spouting nonsense.
Your Highness, that’s because the other adventurers subjugated opponents they could take on. I’m not saying that’s bad, but they’re obviously different from me who fought with foes that are stronger than me as I strived to better myself every day.
How exemplary! Since you’re constantly working to improve yourself, how do you spend your time…? The princess is curious… As am I, how does a person like you spend your days…?
Right… I usually rest at home during the day and venture out when night falls. I’d then patrol the town quietly and help maintain law and order.
Aqua, this guy idles the entire day and calls his depraved life of wandering around patrolling.
Shh, just watch. You know this guy will get too cocky and dig his own grave.
What a strange adventurer. You’re completely different from all the adventurers I’ve met so far. What did you do before you became an adventurer? Says the princess.
Before I came to this country, my job was to guard the home of my family. I trained my skills every day, protecting my home from crisis and disasters. A miserable job that no one would understand nor appreciate…
Hmm, so it’s something like the castle guard in the capital? … They’re the same, they don’t receive much credit. But the guards being idle was proof that the capital was peaceful… So, you too were anonymously protecting your hometown from harm.
I had to deal with people forcing me to sign contracts, telling me that ‘it’ll just be for three months’. I fended off people eyeing my wealth too, lots of things happened.
Forcing him to sign a contract… He must’ve defeated a devil… Wealth… Those were probably bandits…
To think that you won against the hero with the magic sword, Mitsurugi… Pardon my impudence, but may I look at your adventurer’s card? I wish to use Kazuma-san’s skills as reference for myself…
Um, for us adventurers, such information is sensitive– even for the attendants of a princess… Ah, instead of that, Aqua, the party’s simmering down, so it’s about time for you to show your secret party tricks…!
…? I drew something great today, so that’s enough. Megumin, you really want to watch my performance, huh? Can’t be helped then, I’ll show it to you when I get in the mood tomorrow. Hey, more wine, more wine.
We’re not adventurers like you, but the nobility of the kingdom. We won’t carelessly reveal Kazuma-dono’s details. Referencing Kazuma-dono’s skills will improve the combat potential of the kingdom’s army, which will ultimately help in defeating the Demon King. May you please aid us in strengthening the fighting prowess of the kingdom? Or is there some reason as to why you won’t let me look at it?
That man has the weakest job, Adventurer. He probably has a complex about it and doesn’t want others to know. May you let it go on my account?
Yes, that’s right. I didn’t mention this earlier, but I have the weakest job. Oh, this is embarrassing, I got found out.
So, you have the weakest job… Are you as good as you say? You mentioned about winning against Mitsurugi in a fight, but is that true? If it’s so, pray tell us how you won against him.
… Um… It’s hard to believe the handsome Mitsurugi would lose to someone with the weakest job. Are you lying to me, a royal? Even the common people on the streets know about the Swordmaster who wields a magic sword. It’s unfathomable for him to lose to someone with the weakest job in the beginner town, since he’s handsome… That’s what Her Highness said… I think so too, since he’s handsome.
Hey, are the two of you asking for a beating?
Insolent fool! How dare you say that in the presence of royalty?
My humble apologies, my companion said something rude…! He’s a man who doesn’t even know basic manners, please forgive him on my sake…! It’s a fact that this man achieved great merits, and it would be inadequate for Your Highness Iris who invited him to a meal to hand down punishment…!
… Her Highness Iris says she won’t pursue the matter on the account of the Dustiness house. who’s contributed tremendously to the kingdom. However, her mood has been spoiled. The reward for the stories of adventures will be paid out as usual. That con man with the weakest job over there, be gone after taking the money.
Ow, ow! Hey Megumin, what are you…?
… Megumin, you’re really well behaved today. I thought you’d cause a commotion…
I wouldn’t be able to bear it if I’m alone. But if I rampage here, Darkness will be troubled.
My sincere apologies, Your Highness Iris… Please take back your words about this man being a con man. He might exaggerate a little, but he didn’t lie. He might have the weakest job, but he’s a man who’s more reliable than anyone else during a pinch. Princess Iris, may you correct your speech from earlier and apologize to him?
What are you saying, Lady Dustiness? You want Her Highness Iris to beg a peasant for forgiveness…?
… I won’t apologize. If those weren’t lies, then let that man explain how he won against Mitsurugi-sama. If he can’t do that, then that means this man’s a weakling who’s all talk–?
What are you doing, Lady Dustiness?!
Ahhh! No, don’t…!
?
Your Highness Iris, pardon my impudence. However, that shouldn’t be something you should say to someone who did their best and achieved numerous merits. He also has no obligation to explain how he defeated the magic sword user. Also, not explaining doesn’t mean he should be lectured.
… I understand. My comrade covered for me this much, so I shouldn’t keep it from you… I’ll show you how I defeated Mitsurugi. Let me say this first, it’s nothing glamourous, all right?
Enough, that’s enough! Claire, I’m fine!
… Since you’re agreeable, I have no objections. Go all out Kazuma. You won’t say that you’ll lose, right?
Of course, think about all the opponents I faced! From magic sword users to the Generals of the Demon King’s army, even the Mobile Fortress Destroyer! I’ve always been fighting with such people! Take this, I’ll start with Steal!
My bad. This… I’ll return it to you…
…? Eh, ahhh…! Hyaa?
You-why! Why do you always drop the ball at the crucial moment?
Um, my apologies for letting things turn out this way…
Please don’t mind it. We’re partially at fault too. As you can see, the wounds have healed without any traces, so let’s forget about the matter.
… But, to instantly heal that wound without any scars… What a powerful Archpriest.
And Lady Dustiness’s toughness… The lady with crimson eyes who seemed to be a Crimson Demon… With a team formed with such members, it’s understandable that you all could defeat a General of the Demon King’s army… Eh, but Kazuma-dono…
Your Highness Iris. I think it would be better if you say these words personally. It’s fine; I’ve been observing all this while, and Kazuma-dono seems to be the type that dotes on girls of your type, Princess Iris.
… I’m sorry for calling you a liar… Will you tell me stories about your adventures in the future too?
I would be glad to!
– Well then, we’ll be returning to the castle. Lady Dustiness and everyone. Sorry for troubling you.
We should be the ones thanking you for accommodating our shoddy reception… Your Highness Iris, let’s talk again the next time we meet at the castle. I’ll tell you all sorts of adventure tales when I visit.
Well then, the Kingdom will keep your grand accomplishments in our history books. We’ll present you with this to acknowledge your merits.
I’m flattered… Princess Iris, please take care of yourself…!
Your Highness, I’ll visit you some other day and share with you my tales of adventure.
What do you mean?
Teleport!
Princess Iris?
Didn’t you promise that you’d tell me more stories of your adventures?
Welcome back, Princess Iris!
Satou Kazuma-sama, welcome to the castle. You’re a guest, so please make yourself comfortable. Just treat this place as your home and rest easy. This is now your room… Well then, please continue with your tales of adventure! The princess said.
Pardon me, could I have a bit of your time, onee-san? Mage onee-san, this way please.
Is there anything I can do for you? … Ah, just call me Rain. You don’t need to use honorifics with me. I might be a noble, but I came from a small house that can’t compare with the Dustiness house. As the friend of Lady Dustiness, your status is probably higher than mine…
I see. Well then, Rain-san, I’ve something to ask.
I already said there’s no need for honorifics… Using my name directly is fine too… What do you wish to ask?
Um, Rain-san… I hope you can explain the situation… The princess said she’s treating me as a guest… But this is an abduction, right?
It’s not like that. We’re welcoming you as a guest. This isn’t an abduction.
No, this is obviously a kidnapping.
… Her highness Iris always restrains herself, acts like a model royal, is obedient, and won’t give trouble to others. This is the first time in her life that she has done something like this. In this city, Princess Iris had no playmates that matched her status and age. Since this is the first time Princess Iris is acting willfully, can you play with her for a short period of time?
No, no, no, even if you say that… To be frank, I finished all my adventuring stories just now. Can you tell that to Her Highness and let me go back? Just say that I’ve basically run out of adventuring tales the princess enjoys so much.
I brought you here to get back at Lalatina a little bit for hitting me, it’s sort of a prank…
… Also, I felt envious after seeing Lalatina and you all having fun together… Sorry about the sudden willful request. Just for a bit, a few days, can you play with me? The princess said.
… I understand. Well then, I’ll tell you about Darkness… Lalatina. Rain-san, my comrades will worry about me, could you inform them that I’ll be staying here for some time?
Father, the general, and Onii-sama have set off on an expedition to the city near the frontlines in the war against the Demon King’s army. If nothing serious happens, it’ll be fine… When it’s just the two of us, just use the usual tone you take with Lalatina… No, you all address her as Darkness, right? Um, speak to me like how you usually do when you converse with Darkness… Please tell me about all sorts of things outside the castle.
Excuse me… Your Highness, the paperwork is done. Now, Kazuma-dono is now an official guest and can stay in the castle without worries…
And so, Darkness said, ‘Ugh… Why, why did it become like this…?’ and the naked Darkness went around to my back, her face blushing to the tips of her ears. Grabbing the towel tight, she shyly…!
Sh-Shyly…! Shyly did what…?
What shyly?! What nonsense are you telling Princess Iris?! Do you want to be turned into minced meat!?
W-Wait a minute! Please wait! Iris asked me to…!
A mere adventurer dares address Princess Iris by her name…? You shall address her as ‘Princess’! And what’s with the tone you’re taking toward her!?
Hold it, Claire, I requested Kazuma-sama to address me by name. I also asked for him to speak in a natural way. I-Instead of that, Kazuma-sama, Lalatina she…! What did the naked Lalatina do after grabbing her towel tightly?
Princess Iris, no! You can’t ask that! Kazuma-dono, please don’t say such things to Her Highness! And, and why’s a peasant and Lady Dustiness, um… B-Bathing together… T-That’s a lie, right?
Quick, quick!
Everything I said is true. If you don’t believe me, you can test it out. There should be one of those things in such a big castle, right? The thing that rings loudly if you tell a lie, found in the police stations of large cities that are used during interrogations. If there’s one, I won’t mind you bringing it here.
I’ll take your word for it. I did doubt you at Dustiness’s mansion just now… H-However, please don’t tell such things to Princess Iris!
Princess Iris will be the one to decide what she wants to listen. It doesn’t make sense for her to listen to the opinion of a minion like you. We were just getting to the good part before you came in and ruined the mood! Go away! I’m going to continue; can you please leave?
What a joke, how can I let you continue? And I’m not a minion, insolent fool! I’m the elder daughter of house Symphonia that can even match the house Dustiness which you’re so close with. As the escort of Her Highness…
Since the white-suited woman’s throwing a fit about this topic, let’s talk about something else.
W-What do you mean by white-suited woman, lowly brash man! Address me as Lady Claire! Ah, really, what’s with this man…? Lady Dustiness must’ve had a difficult time…!
It can’t be helped… It’s a pity, but let’s hear that story next time.
Well then, let’s talk about something else. I was having a competition with Darkness and we made a bet that the loser will receive an amazing punishment. In the end, I won and…
H-Hurry up and tell me! Please tell me about this!
No, you can’t! You can’t Your Highness, don’t listen to what this man’s saying! This man’s a good for nothing!
Really? Please tell me in detail about this school place and its cultural festival!
Details… Er, kids about Iris’s age will perform all sorts of practical activities. Such as running a cafe-like shop.
What a fantastic and happy place. That really is… Ah, but running a shop with people my age… What should we do if we get bad customers who refuse to pay? And it’ll take a lot of people to run the shop, right? Can we really earn enough profit to pay everyone…?
Running the shop is for our own enjoyment… Not to make money. Honestly, it’s like we are pretending to run a shop. Everyone will wear the same uniform and tout for customers outside. We’re only doing this because it’s fun.
If you want to, how about building a school here? I think it’d be very beneficial for the kingdom.
… So, it’s here again.
Demon King’s army alert, Demon King’s army alert! The knight corps have already mobilized. All adventurers please maintain the peace and security within the city and stop any monsters from sneaking in. All high-level adventurers please come forth to assist!
With how things are, I can’t leisurely focus on academics.
We’ve successfully suppressed the assault of the Demon King’s army. Thank you for your assistance, adventurers. We’ll reward everyone who took part in the emergency quest. Please head to the adventurer’s guild counter…
Thank you for telling me so many interesting things. Rain will send you back to your town tomorrow… May I trouble you to tell Lalatina that I’m sorry for bringing you to this place…? It might not be the frontlines, but it’ll be attacked every now and then, so it isn’t completely safe.
Thank you for accommodating my willfulness tonight, Kazuma-sama… If there’s the chance, may you tell me stories of your adventures again?
Of course. To be frank, I’m quite timid and wished to go back earlier… But, um, for Iris’s sake, I’ll gather all sorts of stories of adventures and come back again.
Hehe, thank you. I feel that you’re just like my Onii-sama from long ago. He might be my Onii-sama by blood, but royal siblings will become strangers after some time. My own brother won’t chat with me like this anymore… I wish you can stay with me a while longer, but if I keep acting so willfully…
What did you say just now?
… Eh? W-Well… I said that I wish you can stay with me awhile longer…
What did you say before that? Before that line, what am I like…?
Um… I feel that you’re just like my Onii-sama from long ago…
Please say it again.
Y-You’re like my Onii-sama.
Can you say it more intimately, again…
Like my Onii-chan.
Kazuma-sama, have you woken? I’m here to bring you breakfast.
Good morning, I’m up.
Today’s breakfast is Lesser Dragon Bacon with fried egg, and salad with plenty of asparagus. Please choose a bread you prefer to go with your meal. The salad’s made from fresh ingredients picked earlier this morning. The asparagus have powerful attacks, be careful not to get hit.
Chu.
Please come in.
… G-Good morning…
… M-Morning, Your Highness Iris. We chatted for so long last night but you still got up very early.
Um, if you can speak to me as intimately as yesterday, it’ll make me very happy…
Is that so? How about trying it again?
Yes! … G-Good morning. O-O-Onii-chan…!
Good morning, Iris.
… Um, please wear your pants…
That’s not it, Iris. Onii-sama’s not a pervert. It just happened that I didn’t have my pajamas with me so I slept in my underwear.
I get it, I get it, so stop talking about that, Onii-sama!
Which means I just need to be Iris’s teacher.
No, not really. My teachers are Claire and Rain, so Onii-sama is, er, my playmate…
I don’t have lessons today, so I hope you can play this game with me…
I’m not a vassal of Iris’s house, so I won’t drag it into a draw and lose on purpose. If we’re going to play, we should go about it seriously. I don’t think I’ll lose in a game, all right? Are you fine with that?
O-Okay! That’s what I’d prefer! No one in the castle wants to be my opponent out of reverence for me! I’m fine with losing! It’s fine even if I lose, so please have a game with me!
That’s the spirit! Don’t cry if you lose, okay? If I make the princess cry, it’ll be troubling in all sorts of ways! I’m going for it! If we’re going to do this seriously, we should bow before we start. Please take care of me!
Please take care of me!
… Um, um, the sky’s getting dark. May we call it a day?
Don’t joke with me, you want to run after winning? Didn’t I tell you that you must give it your all? I can finally see through Iris’s moves, just a bit more and I can win! By the way, don’t even think about going easy on me because you want to end this early! I’ll know if you lose on purpose!
You’re the one who wanted to play seriously, so how did it turn out like this? Onii-sama’s so troublesome!
Shut up! I hate this game anyway! I have a comrade who likes this game too, and it irritates me whenever I see her use Teleport!
Even if you tell me that–!
I came to get Princess Iris because dinner’s ready–but what are you doing? What kind of tone is that? And stop throwing tantrums! Admit your loss obediently and go to the dining hall before the food gets cold! Don’t give Iris unnecessary troubles!
Damn it, we’ll decide on the match tomorrow since Claire’s interfering! But I’ll definitely win next time!
A kid! Onii-sama’s a kid!
Onii-sama? Y-Your Highness Iris, by ‘onii-sama’ you mean this man?
– And that’s why each generation of royalty’s born with more talent than normal people. Taking the heroes who defeated the Demon King into the family as a husband is not simply to reward the hero.
… Kazuma-sama, my apologies. Now’s the time for Iris’s lessons, so can you come back later?
How long is ‘later’? Five minutes?
No, the history lesson will last until evening…
It can’t be helped then; I’ll kill some time outside.
That’s a big help. I won’t keep you then…
I want to fly freely in the sky~ Go, bamboo dragonfly!
Kazuma-sama! Iris’s attention is drawn to outside the window! Please don’t sing and play over there!
Onii-sama, what’s that magic item just now? You looked like you were having so much fun, can you let me play too…?
Oh, you mean this? This is a high quality magic item that’s been enchanted with wind magic. There are no limits to its usage. You just need to turn it like this and it’ll fly off.
How amazing! A magic item with unlimited usage– Isn’t that a divine class item?
If you play that game with me and accept my condition, I can give it to you if you like.
R-Really? I accept, I accept! Please tell me what the condition is!
Checkmate! Yeah! I’m the winner!
All right, all right, it’s my loss. Really, onii-sama’s just like a kid.
Oh? Acting all high and mighty after you lost. Okay, I’ll give you the bamboo dragonfly as agreed.
Thank, thank you very much! … But, is this really fine? Just giving up one chess piece as a handicap for a magic item…
So you’re here, Princess Iris. Leaving me, your escort, behind and running off by yourself is really… Uwah, Kazuma-sama. Is that a bamboo dragonfly? An adventurer with a strange name I met in the past made something similar for me.
Rain knows how this magic item’s made? Amazing, this can rival a divine class item…!
Magic item? No, this is made from bamboo. It’s something like a toy for kids. Anyone can make one after learning the way to craft it…
Onii-sama’s a liar! I won’t acknowledge such schemes; the match just now doesn’t count!
Oh, what about it? I already said yesterday that I’ll give my best to win. If I’m not as good as the opponent, I just need to gain an advantage in some other way. The situation right now is that I found Iris’s weak point of being unworldly and won a tactical victory… Refusing to admit your loss, Your Highness Iris’s so hard to please!
Then, then one more match! We’ll do it again! The same conditions as just now!
Oh my, it’s almost time for dinner. Look, Claire’s here to fetch us. Today’s my complete victory.
Are you trying to run after winning? That’s so unfair, one more time! Help me convince him, Claire! Please!
Hey, Claire, tell Iris the exact same phrase you told me yesterday! Tell her to admit her loss obediently and go to the dining hall before the food gets cold! Say it, quick! Don’t take her side just because she’s a princess!
– Iris, have you thought about going outside to play? I don’t mean going to a city like Axel, but to hike around and go sightseeing. There are many things in this world that we don’t understand. There might be weird devils with good reputations in the neighborhood or a friendly lich that eats bread crumbs as her standard meal.
If I leave the castle, an order of knights would need to be assigned to be my escort. And I’m not permitted to leave the capital alone without my vassals… Also, there’s no way such devils and liches exist. Please don’t look down on me because I’m unworldly… Teleport to this grid.
You don’t believe me, huh? In this world there are many things that can’t be explained with common sense. Did you know that while fish are normally caught in the sea or river, mackerel are caught in the farmlands?
That’s obviously a lie, okay?
I-It’s true! When I was working in a restaurant, I was asked to go to the farm behind to catch mackerel!
That, that’s… Onii-sama was fooled…
Your Highness Iris, Kazuma-sama’s not lying. Mackerel are caught in the fields.
Is that true? How can it be…? A dog flying in the sky would be more believable…
I’ve never seen a dog flying in the sky, but I did see a cat that spit fire before.
That’s definitely a lie! Liar! You’re a big liar!!
It’s true! My comrade has one!!
Ka-Kazuma-sama, that’s really…
You too, Rain? Damn it, I didn’t lie this time!!
You lost focus, onii-sama. My plan worked! All right, it’s my win!
What can I do for you, Kazuma-sama.
May I trouble you to prepare some coffee to freshen me up, Sebastian?
It’s Heidel.
Thank you, Heidel.
Good morning Mary. Don’t think I’ll let you change the sheets so easily, all right? Come, if you want to quickly finish changing the sheets and go about your other chores, you need to say this. ‘Master, please…’
… Master, please…? What’s next Kazuma? Go on, let everyone here have a listen. Continue.
M-Master, please allow me to use the sheets filled with your fragrance…
Do what to the sheets filled with your fragrance? What, isn’t sexual harassment the norm for you? Stop acting shy and hurry up! Say it to everyone here!
S-Spare me…! Anyway, what are you doing here Darkness? This room’s a sanctuary bestowed to me! Who gave you permission to come in?
You’re asking me why I’m here? To bring you back, of course! Really, how long are you going to trouble them here? Go back with me at once! Why, why did you do something so out of place? Megumin was so worried about you being caught up in some trouble and couldn’t sleep!
I-I’m not that worried! I just happened to stay up a few nights. Don’t misunderstand!
Don’t joke with me, I took up the position of Iris’s playmate! I want to live happily in this castle, don’t get in the way of my peaceful life!
Moron! There’s no such job in this country! Listen up Kazuma. You’ve no reason to stay in here. It’s bad to keep a man with an unknown background in the castle!
Then I’ll be Iris’s teacher or something! That unworldly princess who gets deceived easily will be trained properly by me! By the way, what about you? In terms of unworldliness, you’re on the same level as Iris!
Why, you really…! Teacher huh, I’ve already heard all that from Claire! Because of you, Iris received weird influences! When she was taking military and battle tactic lessons, she’d use absurd strategies or despicable methods…! Unlike adventurers, royalties and knights have to fight honorably! Don’t teach her your unscrupulous way of fighting! Aqua, you tell him too!!
That’s right, it’s not fair that only Kazuma gets to live in the castle! Everyone worked together to defeat the Demon King’s Generals, right? If Kazuma gets to live in the castle, I should be able to live here too!
Be quiet Aqua, you’re making things more complicated!
Huh, what? You lost the last time we competed, and yet you still want to challenge me? I thought of you as a muscle-brained sheltered lady, but you actually lack the ability to learn, huh? I want to live a carefree and happy life in this safe castle. Go back if you don’t want me to make you cry!
… All right, I’ll take you on. Everyone, please wait outside the room for a while.
Are you serious? You think you can win without your armor and weapon? You’re wearing just a flimsy and pretty dress today. If you take a hit from my Steal that has certain kill properties in battle, you’ll end up in a disastrous state.
Just try me.
… Do you really understand? If you wear so little, you’ll end up naked after taking three hits from Steal. I can still forgive you now…
I said try me.
Hey, are you kidding me? Is this really okay? I really will do it, all right?
I’ve already said it, try me if you dare! It’s just you and me here! Come, strip me now if you dare!
Wait, I get it, let’s talk this over calmly!
There’s nothing to talk about, I’ve already steeled myself! You can sexually harass others lightly, but you’re a coward who doesn’t dare to cross that line, so strip me if you can! If you strip me and push me down, you can do whatever you want to me! Try me if you have the guts!
The one in charge of the erotic stuff! You really are the one in charge of the erotic stuff! I’ll call you Eroness from now on! Ahhh, it’s breaking, it’s breaking! I’m sorry for lying! Some, someone save me!
Um, um… Lalatina…! Please don’t overdo it…
Ugh… P-Princess Iris…
Hey~ Making the Princess so sad, you’re really the worst, ow, ow ow!
You shut up! … Your Highness Iris, please listen to me. In the town of Axel, this man has some fame as an adventurer. His friends will worry about him if he goes missing. We came here today out of concern for him too… That’s why, may you please let this man go?
… You’re right. Sorry for being so willful…
Lalatina, in that case, at least for tonight… May I host a farewell dinner party…?
Hey Kazuma, this is super delicious! This natural melon together with dry-cured ham! This seems to be really fresh wild honeydew; it’s really juicy.
Kazuma, Kazuma, this is really tasty too… Nom. The high class pudding on the sushi complements the wasabi and soy sauce! I don’t know what dish this is, but the sticky sweetness is mixing with the sauce, making it thick but not greasy…!
Lady Dustiness, considering that you dislike them, it really is a rare sight to see you at such a party! Ara, I’m so glad that I came tonight! Thanks to that, I get to see the beautiful you!
Lady Dustiness, is your father Lord Ignis doing well? I once served under Lord Ignis when I was young…
Ah, Lady Dustiness! I thank the goddess of luck Eris for letting me meet you tonight! I’ve heard of your beauty for the longest time, but you’re more beautiful than I imagined…!
Really, seeing is believing! Compared to your beauty, even the mystical flower that blooms for one night every century, the moonlight rose, loses its luster before you! I know of a place that’ll suit you. After this party’s done, may I have the honor of escorting you?
No, no, no, sir, your house’s probably not good enough to accomodate Lady Dustiness. Please allow me to…
Thank you everyone for your warm reception. I’m not used to parties, so I hope everyone will go easy on me.
So there you are, Lalatina. Oh, you’re really popular huh, Lalatina. Your dress suits you really well today, don’t you agree, Lalatina?
Puah! Cough, ex-excuse me!
Why the sudden comments, adventurer comrade Satou Kazuma-sama? It’ll trouble me if you keep calling me by that name in such a place. You sure are mischievous. Won’t that lead the others to misunderstand our relationship?
Haha, I was surprised when he addressed Lady Dustiness directly by name. In order to protect the people from monsters and out of interest, Lady Dustiness dabs into the adventurer’s line of work. Ara ara, I almost misunderstood their relationship to be closer than imagined.
Well said. However, as expected of Lady Dustiness’s companion, his joke is straight to the point. It might just be a prank, but I’m envious that he gets to address Lady Dustiness directly by name.
Very true, what an enviable position to be in… Speaking of which, has Lady Dustiness been betrothed to anyone yet? If not, please allow me to present myself as the lucky man who’d get to address you by your name…
No, the honor should be left to me who has been proposing to the Dustiness house all this time…
– For Lady Dustiness who’s been contributing greatly in recent years, there should be a more suitable candidate. At least, it’s not any of the gentlemen gathered here.
Lord Alderp, that comment’s really hurtful…
Why the hell are you here?
You, it’s you! You were the one who teleported the core of the destroyer to my mansion! I ended up having to rebuild it! Before the mansion in Axel’s finished, I can only stay in my villa inside the capital! And why’s a mere peasant using ‘the hell’ before me? Address me as Lord Alexei!
By the way, Lord Alderp, who’s the man who can match Lady Dustiness? I heard some rumors that you’re really obsessed with Lady Dustiness, could it be…
Of course, it’s not referring to me. Ah, and not my boy too, all right? For Lady Dustiness, leaving her prestigious house aside, we have to consider her personal achievements. And so, there’s only one man who’s fit to be with Lady Dustiness.
You mean me?
Things will become complicated, so shut up! Go over there and play with Aqua or Megumin!
He’s the man commanding our forces alongside His Majesty in the war against the Demon King’s army, His Highness, the First Prince Jatis. Normally, Lady Dustiness will need to take in a husband in order to inherit her father’s title, but they just need to have more children and let the younger one inherit the Dustiness house.
Lord Dustiness who always worked in the frontlines is a given, and Lady Dustiness who defeated several bosses of the Demon King’s army is also a hero of the kingdom. Marrying his daughter into the royal family will be a fitting reward for Lord Dustiness. And the couple will definitely produce strong, beautiful, and excellent heirs… How about it, aren’t they the perfect match?
In-Indeed…
The perfect match made in heaven…
Hey, what about your complicated relationship with me? Lalatina, are you going to ditch me?
?
You, you, you, what are you saying out of the blue…? Come now, don’t pull such an incredible prank, Kazuma-sama. I did mention that such mischief will trouble me in such a setting, right?
Lalatina, think back to our sweet moments together! Didn’t we spend every day living under the same roof, and even bathed together? Didn’t you wash my back? Recently, you’ve even called me ‘Master’ in a special type of play…
Kazuma-sama, something incredible will happen if your mischief goes too far!
Oh, are you sure this is a good idea Lalatina? Displaying your monstrous strength before the lords and nobles? I’m at fault for stirring things up, but you need to marry someone eventually, right? And you’re at the age where it’d be terrible for a noble if you don’t marry, isn’t it? Young lady, if you show off that strength, no one will want you, ahhh!!!
Ara ara, Kazuma-dono, what exemplary acting! I’m not using much force, but you’re acting as if I am! I wonder what’ll happen if I go at it seriously? Do you want to experience my power after I levelled up?
You’re going overboard with your joke, Dustiness-sama!
– What are you doing in a place like this?
Iris, as expected of Iris! How gentle and considerate, Iris! I was by myself and all alone at the party, you’re a great sister, Iris!
N-Not really…
From tomorrow onward, this castle will quiet down too. The one that made Claire angry and troubled Rain has to go back…
The two of them thought of me as an eyesore for the entire week. Isn’t it great for the castle to become quiet? In my mansion, everyday is like a riot. If I could have one wish, I would wish to have a peaceful life.
I shouldn’t say this since I treated you like a little sister from day one, but Iris, you’ve gotten so close to me just after one week.
Did I trouble you?
No, I’m really happy about this. However, I was wondering why you like someone like me so much.
This is the first time I’ve met someone like you. Everyone keeps on their toes around me and showers me with concern. Only one person was lofty, rude, merciless, and taught all sorts of weird things to me. Even though I’m royalty, he even went all out to compete with me without any semblance of acting like an adult…
Hey, I didn’t ask you to list out things about me that you’re unhappy about. I’m asking what you like about me, all right?
But I am listing out the reasons I like you.
By the way, my win-loss records are better in that game, so it’s my victory, right?
Hey, what do you mean by that? Toward the end we split the games 50-50, or rather, I’ve had more overwhelming wins. If we play on, it’ll definitely be my victory.
Can’t you just admit your loss honestly? Onii-sama’s really a kid!
Ara, declaring your victory against a child, aren’t you a child too?
My time spent with you during this one week will definitely be a precious memory for me…
I’m really envious of Lalatina. She must be having fun every day…
I want to be an adventurer just like Lalatina. All generations of royalty possess high potential for using magic, right? I probably can’t be a Crusader like Lalatina… But what about a Mage or a Priest? Or maybe… A Thief! Being something like the chivalrous thief that’s the talk of the city would be nice! But would Claire be angry if I say that I want to be a Thief?
… Hmm? What did you just say?
Onii-sama, you don’t know about the chivalrous thief who’s the talk of the city? He seems to be hitting the home of nobles with bad reputations and stealing the wealth they got through despicable means. And on the next day, a large donation would be made to an orphanage run by the church of Eris… That’s why the thief’s known as the ‘chivalrous thief’.
As a royalty, I probably shouldn’t acknowledge someone who steals as a chivalrous thief… But don’t you think it’s cool? I might be situated on the side that was being stolen from… But even so, I still yearn for such a title a little.
…Alright, you’re my target!
Darkness! Dark–ness! … Ah, good, Claire’s here too!
Why, why are you here again…? I’m busy, didn’t I tell you to chill somewhere else?
H-How can I help you, Kazuma-dono…
Hey, listen to me! Isn’t the capital in serious trouble?
Well, it is rather troubling. The royal princess is being badly influenced by an adventurer, and if news of her addressing that adventurer as ‘onii-sama’ got to reach His Majesty’s ears, you’ll lose your head.
As Lady Dustiness said, I’ve no intention of covering for you when His Majesty returns from the frontlines. I’ll report what happened in this castle truthfully.
No, not that! I’m just accompanying and playing with a young girl who’s lonely because her parents are out! Nevermind that!!
What I mean is the chivalrous thief committing crimes in the dark! I heard news about it! The thief’s targeting the nobles residing in the capital!
That, that’s true, it seems that the nobles with bad reputations have been hit…
What do you mean to say, Kazuma-dono.
I’ll capture that chivalrous thief who disrupts the peace in the city.
Ah?
He wants to catch that thief? Even though the knights and police couldn’t find any clues even with their extensive investigation?
Speaking of which, who is that suspicious man who’s been loitering around? I’m concerned.
Shh! That plain looking man seems to be Lady Dustiness’s comrade…
That guy? He looks just like a normal man, not an adventurer!
I remember he’s a NEET who’s Princess Iris’s playmate. I saw him being waited on by maids in the courtyard and taking a nap until evening.
Look, I’m close to Darkness who’s a noble, right? From my point of view, this so-called chivalrous thief who steals from the homes of nobles, no matter how popular he might be with the weak, is still my enemy. After all, he might target Darkness’s house next.
Hey, hey! My house hasn’t done any evil things that might attract the attention of the chivalrous thief!
Don’t you agree Darkness? We, who took down multiple Generals of the Demon King’s army, will definitely be able to solve this case. After all, not only did we save Axel, we even resolved the crisis in Alcanretia and the Crimson Demon village! It must be fate that we’re here in the capital. Even though he’s a chivalrous thief, stealing is still a crime. We can’t ignore this!
That, that’s true… But what are you scheming? You don’t have a sense of justice in the first place. Just what do you want?
Look, if I catch this thief, I can ask to freeload in this castle…
I’ve never seen such a thick-faced…
Splendid!
As expected of Lady Dustiness’s comrade! Ah, no, I didn’t do anything that might make me a target of the thief.
He seems to be a man who has fought with the Generals of the Demon King’s army before. Catching the thief must be a walk in the park for him.
Although I’ve nothing to hide, it’d be good if the thief’s captured! Of course, I don’t feel that I’d be targeted.
I understand. Kazuma-dono, please move into the house of a noble you think will be targeted and stay on guard there. If you do catch the thief, I can consider letting you stay in the castle… Everyone, please don’t hold back! Do all you can to assist Kazuma-dono!
Really, will it kill you to not get involved in troublesome things? You even dragged us all in. It can’t be helped, so I’ll assist you with this. Don’t complain about about it later. Really, Kazuma’s so much trouble!
That’s right! This way, you can’t keep saying that we’re troublemakers! Since you’re our comrade, we’ll help you out. We won’t abandon you!!
– And so, you came to my place without any hesitation?
… Oh… Oh! As expected of Lady Dustiness’s companion, how beautiful! If I’m to compare… That’s right! Your beauty’s just like a goddess!
What do you mean by just like a goddess, I am a goddess! I am one!
Ha, not only is your beauty exemplary, your sense of humor is great too!
Just wait for your divine retribution!
Oh, you’re really…
… My Lord… Please be careful… With your words… That’s the legendary girl with her screw loose…
… So she’s…! Dangerous… Screw loose…!
Hey, why’d you avert your eyes away from me, explain it to me. If you’re lucky, I might personally  show you if I’m just like what that man described.
No, no, um… Oh, you look really cute and pretty…
Oh, what else?
… Hey, aren’t you too stingy with your praise for the one who protects Axel every day? I’ll show you how powerful my explosion spell is, so let me borrow your courtyard.
No, I fully understand how outstanding you are!
S-Still, Lady Dustiness, are you implying that I’m a notorious noble who might be targeted by the chivalrous thief? And here I thought you’d be unwilling to stay in my house, but you don’t seem to be against it. It pains me that the famous Lady Dustiness would believe the rumors against me circulating in the streets. If you think I’m someone that the chivalrous thief will go after, please, don’t hold back and stay as long as you wish.
No, we wouldn’t suspect you that way… This is just a part of the investigation…
We’ve permission to stay as long as we want! I’ll be taking the largest guest room!
That’s unfair, Kazuma! I think we should decide after discussing it! I want the room nearest to the dining hall!
I want the room on the highest floor! I don’t mind living in the attic!
… My apologies, sorry for troubling you…
Ah, it’s fine… Um, Lady Dustiness has it hard as well…
What the chivalrous thief is doing is a crime and not worthy of praise. That might be so… But I still feel bad about catching the rumored chivalrous thief…
That might be so, but stealing is still stealing. I there is nothing I hate more than handsome guys who work under the fake banner of ‘friend of the weak’ and ‘savior of peasants in trouble’.
… How should I put this… Your face isn’t that bad, so you don’t need to demean yourself that much. I’d been wondering about this for some time, but do you have some trauma with the term ‘handsome guy’? I’m willing to listen if you want to vent, all right?
I think Kazuma looks pretty good though. I think you need to be more confident.
D-Don’t do that, why are all of you treating me so gently? I’ll feel like I’m really petty, so stop… What is it Aqua? You look more serious than ever. What do you want?
Thou hikikomori who’s at a loss. Don’t blame yourself too much… It’s the world’s fault that thou don’t want to work hard, it’s thy environment’s fault that your personality’s twisted, it’s thy gene’s fault for being ugly. Don’t blame thyself, just push the blame to others…
Don’t joke with me, my self-esteem isn’t that low! Looks aside, my character’s…! Hey, stop! Why are all of you smiling like that? My appearance can still be called average! Hey… Don’t come near me so gently!
Hmm? Oh, it’s just you. What is it, there’s nothing here, all right? Don’t wander around the villa like that.
Huh? What’s with this mirror, a magic item? Like a magic mirror?
Old man, are you here to clean this mirror?
… Want, want to watch together…?
There’s no way I can accept such an invitation. Really, you bought this mirror because Darkness is staying here? I can empathize with you as a man, but… Keeping this room a secret from my comrades is the best I can do. But in exchange, I’ll be staying in this room during our time here, all right? I need to stay here as a safety measure. Get out of here, hurry.
Wait. You want this room, that means…
Hey, stop your baseless speculations! Don’t think that I’ll act the same way as you! I’m just staying here to protect my comrades!
Then you don’t even need to stay in this room, you just need to keep an eye on me when your comrades enter the bath! You get out of here too! How can I let a brat like you see Lalatina’s naked body!
Too bad, I’ve already bathed together with Darkness! That aside, I don’t want to waste my precious time watching over an old man! Not just Darkness, do you want me to tell all the maids that there’s such a room? This is a win-win deal, so shut up if you don’t want to be hated by all the woman living in this mansion!
Tell the maids all you want! I pay them a good salary, and being sexually harassed is part of the maid’s job! But they look amazing when they strip, all right? Aren’t you interested? … How about it, want to make a deal with me? For some reason, I smell the scent of a comrade from you. In such a situation, shouldn’t we guys compromise and work together for our happiness?
… Are, are they that amazing?
Of course, they’re really amazing.
What an interesting topic. Pray tell, what’s so amazing.
This guy’s planning to peek…!
Oh, morning Kazuma. Although it’s already noon.
I got up late intentionally to keep watch against thieves breaking in. I’m not living a depraved life… And didn’t you stay up late every night when I wasn’t around?
? W-Well, I did do that! But I still got up early! Instead of that, any sign of the thief?
Why are you panicking? Are you really worried about me, just like Darkness said? Aren’t you cute?
… O-Of course I’ll worry. Kazuma’s really weak after all, and always gets dragged into trouble. And unlike the protagonist in stories, you won’t be saved in the nick of time during a crisis and might die at any time.
I-I don’t want to be dragged into trouble either, and I didn’t die because I wanted to! Hey, don’t do that, I won’t know what to do even if you put on a serious face to lecture me!
Even so, you attempted to do things to me back in my village. Kazuma, you’re unexpectedly cute.
Kazuma, want to go on a date with me after you finish your breakfast?
Explosion–!!
Look at that Explosion just now! Be it destructive power or effective range, it’s really mighty today, super strong!
All right, all right, explosion spells are amazing. Hey, don’t fidget so excitedly, it’s hard to piggyback you this way!
Even if you say that, I couldn’t see the boulder being pulverized before I…!
I should’ve made you learn Advanced Magic…
Did you say something I can’t just ignore? Kazuma’s words and actions moved me so much back then!
Hey! Don’t look down on the goddess of water, you can’t hide matters related to wine from me! Isn’t there high class wine in the study room? Hurry up and bring it here!
… And then, my Explosion burst out! The pitiful Demon King’s General Hans was turned into dust! Next, I’ll tell you what I did during the fight with the Demon King’s General Sylvia…
Maid-san, Maid-san! Please give me the usual massage! Ah, I want to eat white beef sukiyaki for dinner tonight. Also, when the king size bed and soft and fluffy duvet I ordered arrive, please send it to my room!
Lady Dustiness…
Um, although I did say you can stay as long as you wish…
You don’t need to say anymore! We’ll move out right away!
Oh no… I thought this mansion would definitely be targeted…
To not have a single sentry, am I overthinking this? To think that I’d been avoiding this villa because I had a bad feeling about this place…
…? I sensed a weird presence just now…
Just my imagination…?
Well then, Detect Treasure… Good. Hmm, so it’s this way…
Caught you–!
?
– Okay, keep still! Wahaha, the thief disrupting the peace in the capital, you picked the wrong opponent! You might’ve been able to get by those mediocre people, but don’t even think you can escape from me, who has fought the Generals of the Demon King’s army directly!
Stop…? Wait–? This voice, can it be…!
Is it Kazuma-kun? Hey, wait– Hey, you’re grabbing a strange place!
No, I’m just catching a burglar… Hmm, are you…?
It’s me! I’m Darkness’s good friend, I even taught you a skill before…!
Ughh… I’ve been violated… I can’t marry anymore…
It couldn’t be helped, I thought you were a thief. I don’t have a skill to capture a target. Even if you take this to court, I’m confident I’ll win the suit.
I’ll teach you the convenient Bind skill next time…
So Chris is the rumored chivalrous thief, huh?
That’s right. By the way, what are you doing here?
D-Darkness is here? Oh no, oh no, she’ll be mad if she knew I was doing this!
It can’t be helped. Even though you’re a chivalrous thief, what you’re doing is still a crime. Anyway, Darkness will be on your side. If you apologize properly, you won’t lose your life at the very least. You do the crime; you pay the time.
Wait! You got it wrong, there’s a reason for this!
It can’t be helped; I’ll tell you the truth. Darkness will understand and help me after she hears me out.
Actually, there’s a reason why I’d been burgling the nobles’ houses. That’s…
Wait, stop, I don’t want to hear it! And don’t tell Darkness either!
Hmm? B-But…
Don’t! Get out of here before someone else comes, I’ll let you go!
No, no, um… Like I said, I need your help for something…
I don’t want to hear it! And have you thought it through? The one rushing here’s the notorious landlord known for his lechery! If he sees the captured Chris, he’ll…
I-I’ll retreat for now! I’ll find you next time to discuss that matter!
You don’t need to! Ah, bind me before you go! That’ll give me an excuse for letting the thief go!
I-I got it! I’m off then! Bind!
– Kazuma, are you all right?
This is…! Kazuma, you got hit by a Bind! Where did the thief that broke in go?
Regrettably, I let him slip away just when I was inches from capturing him! I was too careless…!
He escaped… But that can’t be helped. After all, the opponent infiltrated the heavily guarded residences of nobles repeatedly. Nevermind that, are you hurt? What kind of person was the thief?
The thief’s a man wearing a strange mask. He’s incredibly strong, probably stronger than a Demon King’s General.
H-He’s that strong?
… Kazuma, seeing how you’re tied up like a bagworm, you can’t move, right?
It’s obvious, right? I was just one step from subduing him, but I took a hit from his Bind skill when my guard was down. Oh, your magic can dispel this, right? Your magic can undo things like barriers, correct?
Who do you think I am? Of course I can dispel this.
As expected of Aqua, so dependable during critical moments! Free me please, it’s uncomfortable like this.
Hey Kazuma. This is probably not the time for this, but I want to apologize to you for something.
… What, just tell me.
Do you know? Since you didn’t come back for a long time, I ransacked your room to kill some time. Then, I played with the figurine you were making and broke it.
That, that’s fine, I can just make another one. I won’t mind since you apologized so frankly. Instead of that, my bounds…
You forgive me? Well then, I’ll say the rest too! Actually, I thought that no one was using the room anyway and drank in Kazuma’s room. You know, isn’t it a hassle to clean up the bottles and snacks if you drink in your own room? And so, I broke some other things when I got drunk.
I’m sorry ❤!
I-It’s okay. Aqua and I are great friends, right? It’s also my fault for not going back! So instead of that, hurry and do something about this bounds…
Yo, I just realized…!
This is a really amusing situation!
What’s going on! Did that thief break in…? W-What happened here?
Save me!
Not ‘save me’! Say it! Say ‘I’m very sorry for being so arrogant lately’! Say, ‘I deeply regret troubling you all the time’! Say, ‘I apologize humbly for shaming you’!!
I’m sorry! Sorry for troubling you! Sorry for shaming you!!
I want to hear Kazuma say that line again! Quick, say that cool line you said back then! How many points? How many points is my Explosion?
Don’t do that! The feeling’s only there if you say such lines once! Don’t make me say it so many times, I’ll feel really embarrassed!
Come on, say it quick! Hurry up, don’t be shy!
Wahaha, it’s great to reverse the roles every now and then! Next will be…!
Alderp-sama!!
I see. Despite your confidence in apprehending the thief, you failed.
No, it wasn’t a complete failure! If not for me, all the treasures from old man Alderp’s house would’ve been stolen!
… Hmm, let’s say that’s true. Since this is Kazuma-dono who fought with the Generals of the Demon King’s army, we won’t need to use the magic item that detects lies. That’s right, seems like that chivalrous thief’s a hard opponent to beat.
Um… No matter what, thank you for your hard work! This wasn’t a failure in capturing the chivalrous thief, but a success in preventing his theft. No one has the right to blame you!
The generous Princess Iris has spoken. You uttered such boastful words before so many nobles but failed; normally, you should be punished. Be grateful to Her Highness Iris for her mercifulness… Since you failed to capture the thief, there’s no reason for you to linger in the castle, so leave at once!
Sigh, don’t be bothered by this incident. You’ve done well. Like Princess Iris said, it’s true that you stopped the criminal. But we’ll be going back, all right? No one will ask you to work for a while back in town. Aren’t you going to get a huge sum of money from that fellow Vanir soon? I think you should relax for a while.
Kazuma, you’ve played enough, right? Let’s go back to Axel. Even if you don’t stay in the castle, isn’t lazing around at home in Axel fine too?
… Let’s return first…
Hey Kazuma, can we go back tomorrow? It’s a rare chance for us to come here, I want to buy some souvenirs to bring back. The capital has plenty of good wine. Hey, you’re very free, right? Accompany me to go shopping.
The wine in the capital isn’t as great as the rumors made it to be. Compared to their standard, the ones in old man Mike’s shop back in Axel are better.
Who’s this old man Mike? And the acquaintances you know in the town are increasing. The butcher even delivered high quality meat to the mansion some time ago. He said it was a gift for healing him.
Hey, this is the first time I’ve heard of this. I don’t remember receiving any meat from you.
You and Megumin were out at that time. Because we hadn’t had lunch, I asked Darkness to cook it and the two of us finished it off.
Oh? What a coincidence to run into Aqua-sama here!
… W-Who are you?
Aqua-sama, you like to joke as usual.
Hey, Kazuma, who is this person? He’s acting really familiar…
Um, it’s me. The person you bestowed a magic sword to, and chose to save this world. The sword master…
This is Katsuragi-san. We met him before, remember?
W-Who’s that! I’m Mitsurugi! Can’t you at least remember my family name?
You can’t remember just by the name Mitsurugi? The one who uses the magic sword?
… Why. Hey, Satou Kazuma… Did you really remember my name wrongly? To confirm this, can you say my given name?
We’re not so close that we address each other on a first name basis.
I’m Kyouya! Just honestly tell me if you can’t remember! Mitsurugi Kyouya, remember that!
… Really, seems like we need to determine who’s stronger. My abilities have risen since that time; I won’t lose shamefully now! Come, let’s–
What the hell are you talking about? We already had a match, and I won. And I won’t accept any more challenges. So let me retain my record of winning against you as a rookie adventurer.
… You’re…
… Never mind. Instead of that– It’s good that we met here. I’ve something to tell both of you.
All right, back to the topic… So, before that, I have a gift for Aqua-sama.
Aqua-sama, from what I see, you don’t normally wear jewelry, right? You’re charming even if you don’t wear it… But if it pleases you, please take this…
…? What? A present for me?
Yes, please accept it. It isn’t expensive, so I’m not sure if it’ll fit Aqua-sama’s tastes…
What happened to your two minions? Is it fine for you to flirt in such a place?
They’re not minions, they’re my important comrades! They’re grinding their levels in the neighboring country. If we’re together, I’ll always be the one that defeats the most enemies. That’s why I’m staying here to fend off the occasional attacks from the Demon King’s army.
…? The ring’s too small, it won’t fit.
This is enchanted with magic; you can adjust the size here…
Kazuma Kazuma, look here quick.
Ding, ding.
… Amazing. This is amazing, but where did the ring go?
…? It vanished, even I don’t know where it’s gone.
Huh?
Even though it was a cheap item that didn’t fit, it could be used in a performance. Thank you~
No, no need…! I’m happy to be of help for Aqua-sama’s performance.
I’ll get to the point. This is something that concerns you too.
But, the bright light descending on Axel is…
… I think that was referring to Aqua-sama too. At first, I thought that the bright light the Demon King was wary about was me… D-Don’t look at me like that…
It’s done. For you, a gift for the ring. The theme of this work is Goddess Eris transforming into a combination robot. The chest armor is detachable and there are three forms it can change into.
Ha, thank you Aqua-sama. I’ll carefully keep…
Amazing!
… Hey Aqua, make one for me too.
Don’t wanna, I won’t make the same thing again. A mobile suit Winter Shogun would be fine though.
M-Make that one then.
Satou Kazuma. Until I become stronger, please protect Aqua-sama… Well then, goddess-sama, I’ll excuse myself. I’ll treasure this paper folding.
…? Ah, goodbye… Say, Kazuma, is transforming necessary?
It’s necessary, please do the usual.
You and Aqua-sama really get along well with each other.
By the way, it’s been a long time since I was addressed as goddess-sama. That Katsuragi person might be a good guy after all.
By the way, what’s for dinner? Compared to Axel, the capital’s a battleground, so large amounts of meat from powerful monsters can be purchased here. Bringing ingredients to the restaurants in the capital seems to be common sense here. I heard that we can request the staff at the inn to use our ingredients to cook delicious dishes that gives plenty of experience points… I feel like eating something heavy today. Let’s get some high class meat for the inn to grill them for us.
I want to eat something light. I want to eat something with vegetables that goes with wine.
Let’s have a match then. Thanks to Mitsurugi, I remembered that you’re actually a goddess. I’ll give you a special handicap then. If you can win once against me in three rounds of rock-paper-scissors, I’ll make the dish you like.
Hmm? What? You’re really confident, Kazuma. In that case, you might as well just listen to me straight. Let’s go! Rock-paper…!
… Get up… Hey, get up quick.
Tch!
Wahhh! Wait, it’s me! Hey, I’m Chris! Stop! Where are you touching, stop! Darkness! Darkness, save meee~!
Oh, so it’s Chris. If you barged in so late at night, you have something you can’t let anyone else know, right? Still, why are you calling out to Darkness for help?
You, you jerk! Didn’t you grab me after confirming that it’s me? You wouldn’t need to touch that place if you wanted to subdue someone, right?
Really, I can’t let my guard down at all… It’s really regrettable that you’re the only one I can ask.
You came all this way to night raid a guy’s room, so why are you shouting after I touched you a little? Is this some kind of badger game?
This isn’t a night raid! Nor a badger game!! I already told you that I’d explain the reason for breaking into that mansion later! Ah, wait! Hey you, don’t pretend you didn’t hear that!!
Didn’t I tell you I don’t want to listen to your circumstances when we were in Alderp’s mansion? My mood’s terrible right now after parting with the princess! Tell me next time! Specifically speaking, sometime next year!
Why can’t I tell you now? Listen to me! There’s a good reason why I broke into the homes of the nobles…!
This means, normally only people with weird names like you will be able to get these items known as divine relics.
Don’t tell me my name’s weird. I’m not a Crimson Demon.
However, I don’t how it came to be, but two of these lost divine relics have been bought by a certain noble.
Oh.
Among my thieving skills, there’s one that can sense the location of treasures, known as Detect Treasure. And so, I used that skill to search each of the noble houses in the capital.
You mean only notorious nobles with more money than they could ever spend would collect those rare treasures, huh?
That’s right! But I couldn’t find the relics even after I snuck in. I’d always wanted to do something thief-like, so I swiped some of their ill gotten money while I was in!
After that, I sensed a powerful treasure from the mansion you were residing in and snuck in.
I see. Yup, I understand why you snuck in. But I still don’t understand why you’re collecting the divine relics.
The reason why I’m collecting the divine relics… Well, I just might tell you when the time comes. … And so, did you see any strange treasures in the mansion? Did the old man called Alderp use any magic item that seemed really powerful?
Aside from the magic mirror he installed in the bathroom, there weren’t any special magic items… By the way, might the powerful treasure you sensed be Aqua’s hagoromo? She’s been boasting that her hagoromo was a divine relic or something since the beginning.
A-All right, it’s fine then… And so, there’s a reason why I snuck in here.
Shut up, I don’t want to be dragged into troubles! And this feels like a really terrible matter!
Ah, hey! Don’t be such a bother and listen to me! Actually, I could sense a powerful treasure in the castle’s direction. And it’s the same level as the one I felt in the villa, the presence of a powerful treasure!
… I think it’s natural for powerful treasures to be inside the castle… So?
Well, I remember you have the night vision skill Farsight! I also taught you Hide and Detect Enemy! Using these skills, you can sneak in together with me…
Don’t try and make me your partner in crime! I had a bad feeling about this since you told me you wanted to discuss something with me in Alderp’s villa; why would I help you?
Hey, don’t reject me so quickly! At least hear me out properly! It’d be terrible if I don’t recover these two divine relics!
Ask someone who’s more hero-like than me for such an important matter! Right, there’s a guy in this city called Mitsurugi! If it’s that guy, you just need to tell him ‘the world will fall into chaos if the lost divine relics falls into the wrong hands…!’ and he’ll definitely help you!
So cold! I just want you to help me! Enough, I’m going to wake Darkness and ask her!
Hey stop! Darkness is a noble! If Chris’s real identity is revealed to the nobles, she’ll be placed in a bad situation!
But, but…!
All right, hurry up and go home, go home! If you don’t go, I’ll use the Bind skill I learned after you it cast on me to tie you up and sexually harass you! I suffered so much because of that yesterday!
Wait? I-I understand; I’ll withdraw for today! I’ll discuss this with you tomorrow!
I already told you not to come here! Bi…
I-I’ll be going now!
Demon King’s army raid alert! Demon King’s army raid alert! We detected a Demon King’s army group forming up in the plains nearby! Knight Corps, prepare to move out. Because of the massive scale of the attack, we’re appealing for the adventurers within the capital to join in the battle! All high-level adventurers, please gather in front of the castle immediately!
Kazuma, you awake? Did you hear the broadcast just now? Get your gear ready!
I’m still sleeping.
Idiot, this isn’t the time for jokes! The Demon King’s army is here; we have to join in the fight too!
You’re the one who’s kidding me! Listen to what’s being broadcasted: ‘all high-level adventurers, please gather in front of the castle immediately’. I’m only level 17; I can’t even be considered a mid-level adventurer. And there are skilled adventurers like Mitsurugi gathered in the capital, right? Even without us, they can easily repel the Demon King’s army.
Why, why you! Forget it, I’ll join the fray with Aqua and Megumin! Low-level adventurers just need to hide in their beds and shiver!
Not going! Why must I go to such a dangerous place? I came to the capital to play! And you want me to fight the Demon King’s army? Definitely not going!
Aqua, stop squirming around! This is a battle against the Demon King’s army, the more healers we have, the better! Just look at Megumin! See how pumped she is…!
Darkness, I won’t be going to the castle, I’ll go straight to the Demon King’s army! If things turn chaotic after the battle, I won’t be able to use my spell! The first shot’s mine! Or rather, just let me use my powered up magic to wipe out the Demon King’s army in one go!
Wait Megumin, don’t fool around! Aqua, stop playing, let go of the bed! Really Kazuma, I beg of you, please think of something!!
…?
Don’t force me Darkness, I have a bad feeling about this! This is the instinct of a goddess! The same feeling as the ice cream you bought dropping onto the floor, or all the lottery tickets you collected from a shop not winning! An accident will surely happen! So I beg of you! I’ll give you one of my sausages from breakfast, so see you tomorrow!
Let me go Darkness! ‘When the kingdom’s soldiers reach the battlefield, they’ll only see the Demon King’s army that’s been utterly and mercilessly destroyed, as well as a mage leaving quietly…!’ I want to recreate this scene! This is my chance, let me go!
Kazuma! I can’t do this alone, do something about these two!
What are you lot doing, a crisis is upon us. Off we go! Now’s our turn to take the field!
Adventurers, gather this way! There are no specific instructions for everyone! As you haven’t received training in military group maneuvers, you’ll be acting separately from the knight corps, so just fight freely! I’ll inspect everyone’s adventurer’s card before the battle. We’ll provide additional rewards based on the number of monsters you subjugate after the battle, so please do your best!
Satou Kazuma-san, right? I’m sorry, but it’s too dangerous to take part if you don’t have a top-tier job and are below level 30, so we can’t accept your participation. Please return and defend the city…
It’s fine. That man’s a veteran adventurer who’s achieved plenty of merits.
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san. I’m very smart and have the ability to learn. I’ll definitely get into trouble if I take part. For example, a kid whose head was caught in the door when she was young might drag me into her Explosion. Or someone whose brain’s squashed by muscles might attract monsters and pull me into danger. Say, it’s not too late, why don’t we return to Axel?
Not just Aqua, I have the ability to learn too. That kind of thing won’t happen!
Hey Aqua, can you not call me a muscle head? It feels as if the impression of me being the dumbest has been fixed…
What, the opponents are just mobs that have numbers. It’s about time for me to strut my stuff!
Oh!
– Demon King’s army subjugation group, move out!
… Hello. It’s been a while, Eris-sama.
Sorry, I didn’t think that I’d be killed by kobolds at this level…
Let me explain, Eris-sama. Things were going well until the middle part. After receiving buffs from Aqua, I followed behind Darkness. The powerful monsters had been taken by the other adventurers, but I felt that I could kill more monsters than that bunch…
‘The likes of kobolds are nothing’, ‘I’ve grown stronger too’ – With such thoughts in mind, I charged forth to build on my victory…
Um, Eris-sama? I’ll reflect on dying so carelessly, so can you please soothe your anger?
… Sexual harassment is bad.
No, let me explain Eris-sama, it couldn’t be helped. When I first grabbed her I thought she was a boy because her chest was too thin… No, I’m really sorry, please forgive me, I won’t find any more excuses!
… Really, your sexual harassment is really too much. I’ll only forgive you this one time, okay?
Thank you for your magnanimity, Eris-sama! I was just thinking what I should do if the important orthodox main heroine Eris-sama was to detest me.
You’re saying such things again… Aren’t you overjoyed because of your new sister?
I’ll stop my teasing here. Also, I’ve a request for you.
… Request for me?
The devotee who was sexually harassed by you last night already told you part of it, right? The divine relics Aqua-senpai gave to the reincarnated people are circulating in the world.
Oh right, there’s that too. By the way, if I remember correctly, the divine relics will choose their owner, right? I thought I could use that cheat-like magic sword when I took it, but I learned that it’d just be a normal sword in the hands of others.
This explanation is correct… The divine relic will only display its full power in the hands of the one who’d been bestowed with it. A powerful magic sword that can cut through anything will become a normal sword. A staff that can draw forth endless mana will become a normal staff that increases mana regeneration. Other such divine relics wouldn’t give much problem if they were misused…
Hand the retrieved divine relics to Aqua-senpai to seal. There are no rewards or fame for this job. And you can’t bring up the divine relics to people you don’t trust. Since it’s possible for people other than the reincarnated to use a toned down power of the divine relics, there might be people who might go after the lives of all the reincarnated.
Will you heed my request to retrieve the divine relics?
Kazuma-san who died to the kobolds, welcome back!
Is that the first thing you say to someone who just revived? Learn how to act like a goddess from Eris-sama!
… Hey, this might sound conceited to the person who resuscitated me, but couldn’t you’ve done this earlier, when there was still a chance for me to redeem my honor?
Why should I revive someone who died to kobolds? If you died again shortly after, it’d be a hassle.
… Hey, I’ve one more thing to ask. Is that alcohol I smell on you? Did you take a swig of wine in the middle of battle?
Last question… Why’s there something heavy tied on to me?
Well, Darkness said it’d be troublesome if Kazuma’s corpse gets damaged in the battle, so she asked me to throw you in a corner so you wouldn’t get in the way. But after Kazuma was dumped in a corner, there was a monster that attempted to drag you away…
Enough, I don’t want to hear the rest! I get it, you didn’t want me to be dragged off, that’s why you tied me down with something heavy! Thank you for your kindness! I’ve been thinking about this all this while; you guys really have no respect for the dead!
Aqua-san, thank you for your hard work in resuscitation. Here, this way please!
As expected of an Archpriest, what splendid technique! You’ve even mastered resurrection…!
Thanks to you, there are no casualties around here! Aqua-san, thank you very much!
Kazuma, you’ve revived! Are you fine? Does it hurt anywhere?
Lady Dustiness! That was a wondrous performance!
That’s right, it was simply marvelous! Oh, the way Lady Dustiness took the spell with such a carefree expression, and the way she charged into the middle of the Demon King’s Army was astonishing!
I won’t forget the face of the Demon King commander when he saw the way you fought any time soon!
Thanks to Lady Dustiness drawing all the enemy’s attention, there weren’t any heavy injuries. You were a big help!
Hey, the MVP of the battle’s coming through, make way!
Great work, Megumin-san. Make way, do you want to be blown away by Explosion Magic?
The top mage in Axel who returned everything to dust, Megumin-san’s coming through! Make way!
When the battle became chaotic, Megumin was frustrated because she couldn’t use her spell. But the Demon King’s army started to withdraw when things were going badly for them. In the end, the enemy commander said: ‘This is just a prelude battle. One day, I’ll bring an army several times this size and grind the capital into dust!’ After that, when he was attempting to escape…
Oh–that felt great, Megumin-san!
That’s right! That commander had been getting on my nerves for a long time! That bastard always drops that type of speech and runs whenever things get dangerous.
But this is wonderful! Casting the magic into the center of the retreating Demon King’s army and saying ‘I’m Megumin! The number one mage of Axel, user of Explosion Magic…! You’re the one who’ll return to dust…!’ Megumin-san was so cool!
That’s right, this is the best! To think that you can cast such a powerful spell by exhausting all your mana!
Isn’t that right! However, there’s no way a small fry like that can stand before my ultimate technique. After all, I’m the one who sent the Demon King’s Generals into the other world and even pulverized the legendary bounty target, the Mobile Fortress Destroyer!!
So it’s true you took down the Destroyer?
What a splendid archmage! Megumin-san, can you show me some magic other than Explosion?
Oh, allow me to witness it too! I wish to learn the destructive power hidden behind Megumin-san’s Advanced Magic!
… Well, I do want to show it to you, but I’ve already exhausted my mana. Such a shame…
Of course. It’s fine if you do so tomorrow too, Megumin-san!
Ara, I can’t wait for tomorrow morning!
I’ll tell the others too!
… W-Well, um, I might be busy tomorrow… Ah, Kazuma! Great, you’ve revived! It must be difficult for you after just reviving, so let me look after Kazuma tomorrow…!
The knights and adventurers have returned victoriously–!
Dear knights and adventurers! Thank you for your hard work! The capital’s safe thanks to your exemplary performance! Her Highness Iris expresses her sincere gratitude on behalf of the kingdom… Look forward to your bounty payment!
Also! To reward everyone for their efforts, we’re preparing a banquet. Everyone must be tired after the battle. Please rest until evening before coming back to the castle. We’ll then present a special reward for those with outstanding performance! That’s all, thank you everyone!
Lady Dustiness, pray tell us about the details of the battle inside the castle…
I heard about your exploits in this battle…!
Right, I wish to learn about Lady Dustiness’s glamourous fight too!
Hey Kazuma. Before the party begins, I’m going to preach to the people I healed and invite them to join the Axis Cult. I healed them after all; they should show me their gratitude.
They’ll thank you properly even if you don’t bring it up. You’re always doing such things, that’s why your devotees don’t increase.
Ah, just put me down here. I’ll let my comrade carry me.
Didn’t you say you’ll take care of me who’d just revived?
I’ll do that tomorrow, please spare me for today. Kazuma, we’ll be returning to Axel tomorrow, right? Let’s leave first thing in the morning.
It’s great that you’re safe, onii-sama! Welcome back!
Onii-sama?
Oh, it’s Iris. No, I’m not completely fine. I died and was revived.
You died once? Onii-sama, are you all right? Come rest in the castle until the banquet begins, your room still in the exact same state!
She said ‘onii-sama’ again!!
Thank you. But you don’t need to worry so much, the resuscitation was done perfectly.
That’s a relief… But onii-sama, did you achieve a great enough merit for you to stay in the castle?
No, that… Well, I’ll fail sometimes too, right? My condition wasn’t good, so I didn’t accomplish much…
Is that so… But it’s enough that you came back safely! And even if you didn’t achieve any merits, it’s still a fact that you fought for the capital. I’ll plead with Claire once more, and maybe onii-sama can stay in the castle!
Thank you, Iris. However, my death was really embarrassing, so it probably won’t work… Anyway, I’ll see you tonight.
… I let you out of my sight for just awhile, and that Iris kid became really close to you, huh?
Right? I finally have the sister I wanted so much. Maybe I do like girls younger than me.
… After we go back to Axel, I’ll call you onii-sama then.
You’re an important loli character, all right? I’d prefer to have someone else as a younger sister instead.
Hey, it’s about time you stop treating me as a loli character!
Hmm, this place isn’t bad. Living a casual life under the care of the maids and butlers, huh? I understand why you don’t want to go back.
I know, right? The food’s nice and the servants attend to your every needs. If you stayed here, you wouldn’t want to go back either, Megumin… Ah–in the end, I didn’t accomplish much, so I have to return tomorrow…
… I think this is great too. Showing my prowess in the capital’s fun… However, I like the times when we complete quests together and bicker rowdily in Axel the most. From tomorrow onward, the four of us can live together again.
Yeah, you’re right. I’m not that serious about wanting to live in the castle!
Really? You might be saying that now, but didn’t you really enjoy your time together with that child Iris?
Onii-sama, sorry for disturbing you…
– I’m very sorry, onii-sama can’t stay in the castle. Even though I tried to convince Claire in all sorts of ways…
It can’t be helped. Or rather, it’s my fault for not doing enough.
Onii-sama, you don’t need to apologize. You literally put your life on the line to fight…
… Did the two of you forget that I’m here?
No! I-I didn’t forget!
Iris’s right; I didn’t forget about Megumin! I’m not a lolicon, don’t look at me with such suspicious eyes! Iris is just like my sister, there’s nothing strange about this atmosphere! …W-What, Iris, don’t look at me with such sad eyes! That would just cause more misunderstandings, even I might misunderstand too!!
… Hmm? As expected of Your Highness, you have a powerful magic item on you. The level of the enchantment is worlds apart from others. Is that necklace a divine-level magic item? It doesn’t seem to be a product of the Crimson Demon village, so just where did it come from?
You mean this? I think this was a necklace that was given as a tribute to my real onii-sama… As the representative of the royal family, I’m just holding on to it for onii-sama while he is out on an expedition.
So, what powers does this magic item have? With its extraordinary magic power, its effects must be spectacular! It might be a magic item strong enough to destroy the world!
Well, the truth is… The way to use this magic item isn’t known yet. It’s said that the powers of the magic item can be activated by chanting the keyword… Word-like engravings can be seen on it, but the scholars in the castle couldn’t decipher it despite their research…
Hmm? Isn’t that Japanese? ‘Your things are mine, my things are yours. I’ll turn into you!’… Who made this kind of keyword, are you kidding me?
Hmm? W-Wait, Kazuma, the princess’s necklace is shining?
O-Onii-sama? Could it be, the magic item’s activating…?
Eh? W-Wait, throw it out! Iris, throw it out the window right now!!
… Hmm? Nothing happened.
How long are you two going to stare at each other? Just now too, don’t keep forgetting about my existence.
No, that’s not it, Megumin, something incredible just happened!
W-What, addressing me directly by name is really callous of you, Your Highness. I’m an older sister, if you want to call Kazuma onii-sama, then address me as ‘Megumin-nee’ or ‘Onee-sama’… And it’s better for you to not talk in such a tone, all right? That Claire woman said that you received a bad influence after getting involved with Kazuma. I think it’s too late to save you.
U-Um… I’m Iris…
… I-I-I turned into Iris? What’s going on? Ahhh! For real? A dress! I’m wearing a flimsy dress! What’s this, the fresh feeling of wearing women’s clothing right after opening my eyes!
Onii-sama? Onii-sama’s inside my body? Onii-sama, don’t do something so crude with my body!
But, hold on, this is bad in a variety of meanings, Iris! The dress is bad; I can’t relax with my lower half like this! Girls are really amazing to walk so confidently in public in such a defenseless state!
Onii-sama, don’t do that anymore! You can’t, stop!
You’re the one who should stop! I’ve a rough idea what happened, but the scene of you hugging that body who’s flipping the skirt around is too impactful!
Iris-sama? I heard you scream just now, what did they do to you?
C-Claire, it’s nothing! I just got a little excited when I was chatting with onii-sama!
Is, is that so? That’s fine, but don’t chat too long with that man, or you’ll learn bad things from him.
I-I’m fine, please carry on your sentry duties!
What should we do next? Personally, I don’t mind living as a pretty young girl from now on, but it’s hard to give up the body that’s been with me since birth. How can we undo this?
You just said something incredible just now. By the way, does anything feel unnatural to you, Iris? Any pain or discomfort?
I have no problems. As for my personal opinion, um… A man’s body’s tall and strong. I feel like going out on an adventure right now.
I’m sorry princess, but I hope you don’t speak in such a tone with that body…
But what a failure. Even when we tried that keyword again, the necklace glowed, but the swapping didn’t occur…
There might be a keyword to undo the swap. But this is an amazing item since it can swap people’s bodies. I’ve never heard of such a powerful magic item before.
What should we do…? We can’t go back to normal like this, right? I’ll have to live on as an adventurer… Get chased out of the castle and be a free adventurer… Find reliable comrades and defeat the monsters blocking my way one after another, and travel to cities I’ve never been to before…! Onii-sama, what should I do? I don’t really hate such a life! Even if my body stays like this forever!
Calm down Your Highness! You just said something really stupid!
It’ll be fine; I know what this magic item actually is! This is a divine relic. If someone other than the one it was bestowed upon uses it, the body swap should be temporary. I don’t know how long it’ll take, but we definitely won’t stay this way forever.
… Which means, we’ll return to normal if we just wait it out. It’ll be great if we recover before the victory party tonight…
O-Onii-sama! Um… I’ve a request!
W-What? … Ha, Iris is about that age too. You’re curious about a boy’s body, right? Hey, toying with my body’s no good.
T-That’s not it! Onii-sama, I should be telling you not to be mischievous with my body! …W-Well… Even if it’s just once, I hope to take a look outside the castle without bringing my vassals along…
You two are really a handful. Kazuma can’t accompany you like this, so I’ll follow you. It’s fine, I won’t ask for much like your vassals. Even if you dislike someone’s face and pick a fight, I’ll just watch from the sides.
You should stop her then, why else would you be accompanying her?
Let’s go together then, onee-sama!
Ah, well… I did ask you to address me as onee-sama just now, but please just call me Megumin…
Megumin-san, please take care of me!
Leave it to me. From bargaining prices to handling people looking for trouble, I’ll teach you everything.
… Your Highness, what happened in that man’s room just now? The air about you seemed different… Did he teach you something bad?
Claire, that isn’t a nice thing to say about Kazuma-san. He’s a great person; he might even leave his name in the kingdom’s history books.
Princess Iris, tell me, what did he say to you? As I suspected, it’d be better to finish that man off…
Hmm, isn’t this Princess Iris and Lady Claire?
Mitsurugi-dono, your performance was wonderful this time too! My apologies for letting you take on the dangerous role of vanguard again.
Not at all, this is nothing. I think of protecting Your Highness Iris who watches over the citizens of the kingdom as my duty.
Claire, sentence this insolent man who touched my head to death.
Eh?
Princess Iris, you’ve been acting strangely since just now. What happened?
Say Claire, where’s Lalatina? I want to tease… No, I want to compliment her for her efforts in this battle.
Lady Dustiness suffered flame attacks during the battle and is covered in soot all over. She’s bathing right now…
Claire, lead the way! I’m going in right now to wash her back!
Your Highness? What’s the matter? For a royalty to wash the back of a vassal, even if it’s Lady Dustiness…
As thanks for all the hard work you’ve done, I’ll wash your back too, Claire. Do you dislike it?
Not at all, Princess Iris! Let’s go, come, hurry!
Greetings Princess Iris, are you cleansing your body before the banquet?
No, I just wanted to wash the back of Lalatina who performed wonderfully during the battle… But it seems that I came too late. Such a pity…
N-Not really! I couldn’t waste Your Highness’ goodwill! There’s still plenty of time, I’ll enter the bath again!
Dark…! L-Lalatina, wait, if you take off your clothes without any shame or hesitation, I, I haven’t braced myself mentally…!
P-Princess Iris, what’s the matter? Your cheeks are turning red…
Your Highness, are you feeling all right? You’ve been acting strangely since just now…
Worry about tomorrow’s problem, tomorrow.
– How dare you speak to the boss like this! You must be prepared to die, huh?
You, you bastard! How dare you bad mouth the boss that far! Look, the boss turned dumb because of your words!
D-Don’t be stupid, I didn’t turn dumb! I’m just a bit shocked after being scolded so badly for the first time in my life!
Yes, that’s the way, well said! Next is the winning line! ‘… Enough talk. I’m not that free either. I’ll turn all of you into my experience points…!’ You’ll make the grade after saying that, all that’s left would be to beat all of them up!
Don’t look down on us! Let’s get it on!
Uwah? You, you guys! Can’t you see that I’ve someone on my back, you despicable scoundrels? If you want to fight, let me put her down first!
Despicable scoundrels? Hey, aren’t you the one who said ‘I don’t need to go all out against trash like you. I’ll give you a handicap, so you three come at me together’!
Just how much do you want to insult our boss? What did he ever do to you?
Kazuma, are you back to normal? Hurry, transfer your mana to me via Drain Touch, then I can fight as well!
You’re the one who stirred up this trouble! Settle it yourself!
They’re just a bunch of delinquents, powerless before my overwhelming strength.
Your job’s not the physical attack type, but you’re still a high level adventurer. Why’d you get so serious in beating up normal people?
I wanted the princess to have a go at it, but you reverted back just when the mood was great. Such a pity.
Hey, what if Iris gets into trouble? Don’t involve the fragile princess in a fight.
What are you talking about? Royalty are really powerful, all right? Because of their bloodline, the royals have great talents, and receive an elite education from childhood to protect themselves. That princess is stronger than Kazuma, okay? She’ll easily win even if she fought in Kazuma’s body.
By the way, how did the quarrel start? What did those guys do to you two?
Actually, after shopping around all sorts of stores with the princess, they appeared out of a desolated alley.
Normally, if they saw a girl like me, shouldn’t they say: ‘Hey, your girl looks pretty good. We’ll give her a good time, so you can scram now’ and start harassing me, right? But they only took a glance at me without saying anything. Seeing how gutless they were, I scolded them fiercely.
You’re the delinquent! Don’t drag innocent pedestrians into this!
Forget it, I might’ve been the one who taunted them, but they’re the ones who hit you first. It’ll be fine, we’ll win even if it gets taken to court. The ones who got physical after a little squabble are the ones in the wrong.
That’s not for someone who loses her temper with just a little provocation to say! Ah, really… I’ll apologize if I ever run into them again…
Never mind; some things happened, but Her Highness had fun. It was her first time eating from a roadside stall, and she really enjoyed herself.
Really… That’s fine… I guess? I hope they won’t say I was a bad influence again…
… Kazuma spoils her too much. Not only her young age, but many aspects of her character overlap with mine too. It makes me strangely uneasy.
A-are you still insisting that your character overlaps with that beautiful, gentle, and elegant girl?
Hey Kazuma, why are you so stupid? You always treat me like a fool, now’s my chance to use that against you. Hey Kazuma-san, you’re a really big idiot, huh?
No, I didn’t have such intentions in the beginning. But, how should I put this… All sorts of people bowed their heads at me while I was strolling in the castle and I felt that I would be forgiven even if I did something…!
So you really are an idiot, huh? If I search the term ‘idiot’ on a computer, Kazuma’s name would be the first result, right?
Even Iris got so furious… Damn it, onii-sama can’t live anymore…
… Really, just squat in this corner today, be a good boy, and don’t attract any attention. I’ll get you some delicious food later.
As expected of the one who’s been with me the longest. I really hope the others can learn from Aqua’s leniency. I’ve been wondering since just now, what’s that wine you’re cradling? When we went to search in the city yesterday, we didn’t find any good wine, right? Did you buy something else?
Oh this, didn’t the people in the city say they were giving out special rewards for outstanding performances? They asked me what I wanted and since everyone was busy, I asked for this wine on behalf of our team.
It can’t be helped, wait until we go back to Axel, we all can…
… What are you trying to do? You’ll break it or lose it somewhere anyway, it’d be a waste of the high class wine. It’d be fine if you bought the wine yourself, but this wine’s a reward for everyone’s exceptional performance. Here, I’ll hold on to it for you.
Don’t wanna. I got this wine myself, and I won’t give it to anyone, all right? After all, the one who gave it to me said, ‘Everyone performed well, but Aqua-sama’s work was exemplary!’. It’s all because of me that no one died in battle, which made him happy. Getting such a reward should be a matter of course for me.
Hey, this is the fruit of everyone’s labor! It looks really exquisite, let me… Ah, this girl!
Ara, this battle was a piece of cake! With Lady Dustiness leading the way, her team fought on the front lines like ferocious lions, contributing greatly to the battle!
That’s right! Lady Dustiness who took all the enemies’ attack alone, as well as Aqua-dono who purified a large number of undead and could heal wounds in an instant, no matter how grievous they were. Last but not least, Megumin-dono who gave the retreating Demon King’s army the final blow! With just the three of them, they might even defeat the Demon King!
Indeed, the three of them would be able to fight on par even with the Demon King! I already heard that the three of them took down several Generals of the Demon King’s army. As expected of them…
We also have the pride of the kingdom, the magic sword hero Mitsurugi-dono! If he joins this trio, wouldn’t that be the strongest team that’ll surpass the Demon King…? He also has a lancer and an archer girl in his team. Wouldn’t that be a perfectly balanced team?
That’s it!
That’s the one…
Yes, that’s him. Lady Claire mentioned that he’s nothing but talk…
And his job is the weakest job, Adventurer, and his level is low.
Really, why did Lady Dustiness allow such a person to be her comrade…?
Maybe he’s a guy who’s good at currying favors. He even amused Princess Iris and tried to move into the castle to stay…
That’s right, she’s a daughter of an aristocratic family, after all.
Oh, so you’re still in the castle, plebeian.
The guests of honor tonight, Lady Dustiness and the rest will stay in the castle tonight. You can go back already.
… No, I understand you’re angry. I also know that I was too arrogant. But this is already the last night, so just be nicer to me. Aren’t you a little happy to have bathed together with Iris?
D-Don’t spout nonsense, what are you saying? That I’m happy to bathe together with Her Highness… That… Forget it. I won’t pursue the matter.
Just like your attempt to capture the chivalrous thief, you didn’t show any results this time either… You’re really all talk. I did some investigation on the fights with the Generals of the Demon King’s army; the ones who dealt the final blows were Lady Dustiness and that mage, right?
My job’s to provide support for them. By the way, they have flaws too, all right?
I already know about their flaws. However, it won’t be a problem if the kingdom provides support. They’ll be invited to join Mitsurugi-dono’s party later. That way, we can realize the grand dream of taking down the Demon King, right? Don’t you already have loads of money? Why not leave the team and live merrily in that town of yours?
I agree with you on the living merrily part, but why are you forcing me to leave the team? A group of ruffians said the same thing to me, but came back running in tears after teaming up with them. Can you support them properly?
Like the battle this time, just support them with a group. With their exceptional skill, their strengths can only be brought out in a large scale battle. Do you have any skills like they do? … Think about it. In the end, if you display an ability better than Mitsurugi-dono and the others, we can just laugh this matter off.
Putting that aside, what are you going to do about Iris’s necklace? Don’t let her wear that, it seems to be a divine relic. My comrade Aqua can seal the divine relic, how about leaving it to her?
That can’t be done. That’s a tribute for the first prince Jatis. Before His Highness Jatis returns, we can’t dispose of it on our own… Or rather, it’s just a divine relic that switches bodies for a short period of time, so it isn’t harmful at all, right?
Rather than that–you’ll be leaving the capital tomorrow. The capital doesn’t need you. If you insist on staying, I’ll chase you out by force. Never mind, you can enjoy this party today too… If you can show that you deserve it.
How vexing! What’s with that woman, saying such hurting words on this last night! I know I’m at fault too! Or rather, it’s all my fault!!
Yo. Isn’t there a party tonight? You’re back really early, huh?
I won’t agree no matter how many times you ask. But I’ll tell you what I do know. There’s a divine relic that can switch bodies in the castle. However, the period’s short, and unlike the monster summoning magic item, I think it’s rather harmless.
That magic item. If one of the bodies dies during the swap, it won’t switch back.
… Hey, what did you just say?
If that magic item is used well, one can gain eternal life; that’s how powerful it was. If your body starts getting old, you can swap with a healthy body and kill the other party. It’d be even better if you transfer your fortune to the younger person in advance.
I remember that this magic item was bought by some noble at the very beginning.
But, it somehow landed in the hands of the Princess… Isn’t that strange? Who, and for what purpose, gave that thing as a tribute to the royal family?
Hey, this is no time to joke. We’ve got to report this to the big wigs in the kingdom…!
I advise you not to do that. Can you predict the movement of the people who knew about the powers of the divine relic? I can tell for certain that the nobles will start eyeing the divine relic… Not just that, the royals might even use it for misdeeds too. No, the more authority one has, the more one craves eternal life.
I only told you about this because you’re someone who wouldn’t use it for evil even if you got hold of it.
Hey, you’re the playmate of the princess, right?
Want to go to Her Highness’s side and play?
Hey, what do you have there? It looks cool. Where’d you get it from?
This was given to me by a suspicious clerk working in a certain magic item shop in Axel. I heard that it’s a top seller.
Hmm~ I want one too, what kind of person is that suspicious clerk?
What kind…? … He works diligently in chasing the noisy crows away from the trash area, known in the neighborhood as ‘Crow-Slayer Vanir-san’…
Hmm~ Isn’t he a really earnest guy? I want to meet him!
Well then, are you ready, minion?
Any time, lady boss.
Hey, don’t call me lady boss.
Then don’t call me a minion! And why’s my position lower than yours?
Because my job’s a Thief, I’m the professional here. Your job’s Adventurer, right?
That’s true, but since I have Farsight that gives me night vision, I’m more suited for burglary. I should be the boss in terms of ability, right?
But, but, the one renowned as the chivalrous thief in the capital is me, okay? There’s no end to this, let’s just settle it in a simple match!
Match, huh? Well then– Luck’s necessary for thieves, so let’s play-rock paper-scissors.
Rock-paper-scissors? All right, let’s do this! Now that you mention it, I lost when we competed with Steal last time, so today I’ll avenge myself.
– Let’s think of a way to sneak in, Assistant-kun.
You’re right, Big Boss. And I didn’t become a NEET in the castle for nothing. When I got bored and wandered around the castle, I figured out its rough layout. I’ll lead the way.
Assistant-kun, are you planning to break in through here? The walls are really tall, looks at least three stories high… I can’t do anything with this…
Snipe.
Assistant-kun’s really useful. Forget about being an adventurer, you should form a chivalrous thieving group that focuses on punishing the evil nobles together with me.
If my money runs out and I’ve got nothing better to do, I’ll consider it… All right, let’s go!
From now on, it’d be best if I walk in front. I’ll use my night vision and move slowly, so you just need to follow behind me, Big Boss.
Understood, Assistant-kun.
Bad news, Big Boss. The door’s locked.
It’s my turn, time for my lock picking skills to shine.
Oh, someone’s coming. Enemy Detection is giving off a reading.
Hide in that corner, don’t forget to activate Lurk.
Hey, Assistant-kun, do you have to stick so close? We already used Lurk, so you don’t need to work so hard not to be discovered, right?
It’s not good to underestimate the enemy, Big Boss. Here, stick closer, quick!
Assistant-kun, this is too close!
Big Boss, this is for the sake of retrieving the divine relic and world peace. Please bear with it!
… Is someone there?
Just my imagination…
Really, that’s why I’m telling you that underestimating the enemy isn’t good. If I didn’t handle it carefully, we would’ve been in trouble.
No, no, no, it’s all because of you that I made some noise which attracted the guard’s attention! If you sexually harass me again, you’ll suffer divine punishment from the goddess Eris.
Hey Assistant-kun, if possible, I’d like to take a look in the treasure vault. Like I said, both divine relics are in the capital, so the one that can control monsters might be here. The only places with such an acute treasure presence are Alderp’s mansion and this castle.
That isn’t a problem, I came prepared.
This is a tool that only the demon race possesses, called Barrier Killer. Apparently, the Crimson Demons were selling it… I don’t know how they got them, but I managed to ‘borrow’ this from a noble who bought it.
Amazing, now we just need to watch out for the traps.
That’s right. For us who have skills to detect and disarm traps, this is a piece of cake.
Oops, there’s a trap here. The alarm will ring if you take this treasure with you. If the target divine relic isn’t here, don’t touch the goods.
Assistant-kun, the thing we’re looking for isn’t here. There are many powerful magic items, but nothing at the level of the divine relic… Assistant-kun?
Isn’t this a manga…?
Um… If you take that away…
I’m fine, it’s just a book from back home. I’m just feeling a little nostalgic.
Don’t be sad for me. And I bought that manga before, so…
… Let’s go then, Assistant-kun… Oh right! After sealing the divine relics away, I’ll collect a bunch of books from your country and give them to you, so…
Assistant-kun–!!
– Over there, the intruders went that way!
There are two of them! We don’t know what their goal is, but we can’t let them roam free!
Damn, what a formidable trap! It even got me…!
Assistant-kun, I need to have a good talk about life with you later! You’re living too unrestrainedly!
Big Boss, now’s not the time for banter! We need to overcome this little problem!
That may be so, but you’ve no right to say that!
Create Water! And Freeze!
Having Assistant-kun around is really convenient.
Don’t just say that Big Boss, help me!
Okay, I’ll show you the ability of the Big Boss!
Wire Trap!
This is just to buy time, but it’s enough for us to escape! Assistant-kun, we can’t complete the mission after drawing everyone’s attention like this, let’s withdraw for now!
No, wait, I want to settle things today! I’ll be chased out of the capital tomorrow!
E-Even if you say that… If we, a Thief and Adventurer duo, were to fight with others head on, we’ll be nabbed easily! And since when were you so determined to fight?
Assistant-kun, let’s withdraw! Even if you want to return to Axel–though it’d waste some time– I’ll help you out!
Big Boss, I…
I’ll show you my true ability.
… Assistant-kun?
– We cut through the web! The thieves are… They’re still here, they didn’t escape!
Thieves, I’ll make you all regret breaking into the royal castle! Just leave one of them alive to interrogate!
Captain, one of them has a dagger, the other’s unarmed. Let’s capture the weaker looking one who doesn’t have any weapons!
Hmm, the silver haired one does seem stronger. All right, don’t hold back against the silver hair! The two of us should be enough to take on that masked weakling!
The opponent’s a suspicious thief, don’t show any mercy!
The two of them aren’t moving… Hey, intruders! This is your chance to surrender! You might get to keep your life! Now, just give up…
What–?
W-What did this guy do–?
Hahaha! Great! This feels awesome! Power is welling up from within me– I don’t know why, but I’ll let you witness my true prowess tonight!
A-Assistant-kun? You’re acting really strange! What happened?
Big Boss! Just turn right around that corner and we’ll see the stairs to the topmost level!
All right, I-I got it! B-By the way Assistant-kun, you feel different from usual… Even your tone’s weird, what happened?
Thieves! Strong thieves have infiltrated the castle! Get those elite adventurers up, quickly!
Listen up! Don’t attack recklessly! The opponent’s skilled, but it seems that he doesn’t plan to kill anyone! Even so, don’t act rashly!
Knight commander! Please evacuate to the safe zone!!
B-But we can’t let that masked man go any further…!
Get out of the way, the Silver Haired Thieving Group’s coming through! If you don’t want to get hurt, make way!
Assistant-kun, when did we decide on that name? Things have blown up, so you can be the leader, change it to Masked Thieving Group or something, quick…
Wind Breath!
Ughh! Damn, always using such tricks… AAAH~!
Masked Thieving Group’s no good. It sounds as if I’m the mastermind, I don’t like it.
I don’t want to be the mastermind! I didn’t want to make a ruckus and attract so much attention! If things go badly, I’ll be targeted just because I have silver hair! And what’s that technique you just used?
This is my certain kill technique, so I can’t reveal too much. That aside– I won’t be able to handle it if the opponent also uses magic… Hey, someone that looks like a mage really showed up! I’ll leave him to you, Big Boss!
Leave it to me! I’ll take care of that one…! Skill Bind!
Lightning! … Hmm? What!?
Bind!
Another one of our guys is down! What’s with that guy? And he’s unarmed!
Where are the adventurers? Haven’t the powerful adventurers arrived yet?
B-Because… The alcohol content was higher for the feast, they’re all dead drunk…
Adventurers aren’t reliable after all!
Knights and guards are a terrible matchup against opponents with thieving skills! Can’t we do anything about this?
It’s impossible to use the mana intensive Bind repeatedly…! Does this guy have lots of manatite on him…?
But I didn’t see him take any manatite out! Which means…
That thief has enough mana to rival the Crimson Demons…?
Ahhh! No, don’t let them get to the topmost level! I don’t know what their goal is, but Her Highness Iris is there…!
Wire Trap! Wire Trap! Wire Trap!
All right, no one can break through here any time soon! Next, we’ll…
– I just need to arrest the both of you and ask what your objectives are… Who are the two of you? Are you the rumored chivalrous thief?
To cut off your own retreat path… Intruders, you can’t escape.
What should we do, Assistant-kun? There are too many of them! We’re trapped!
Claire-san, I heard that masked man’s very strong. He might be unarmed, but who knows what he’ll do if we push him. I’ll take him on, so please deal with the silver-haired young man with the knights.
… Hey, Assistant-kun, why am I being treated like a boy since just now? Do I really look that much like a guy with the cloth covering my mouth?
The root of the issue’s your slender body… Big boss, don’t be depressed, now’s the crucial moment.
Big Boss, if we take down the strongest guy, we can intimidate the others. Allow me to defeat that good for nothing cool guy in an instant. Let’s break through in the confusion right after that.
Hey, I heard that. The ‘good for nothing cool guy’ you mentioned is me, right? Defeat me in an instant…? I’m really being looked down upon by an unarmed man. All right, I’ll show you my true…
This movement, are you planning to use Steal? Unfortunately, after I lost to a certain man, I now carry a lot of redundant items on my person to guard against this skill. Just give up now and…
Freeze.
What are you scheming? Take this…?
Create Water!
Guuguu?!
Can you admit your loss and back down?
Freeze!
Kah!
Mitsurugi-dono!
He probably won’t suffocate if you help him defrost. Is there anyone else who thinks he’s stronger than this fellow? Come at me if you have the guts! … Big Boss, now’s our chance! Charge in!
I can’t figure out whether you’re strong or weak. However, I certainly don’t want to be your enemy…
Rain, being a little rough will be fine, but thaw Mitsurugi’s throat quick! And what’s the lot of you doing? Attack them! Even if Mitsurugi-dono’s defeated, we can’t just let them get away!
But from their high evasion rate, the two of them probably have the Escape skill! If they’re determined to run, we can’t do anything…! Hey! Split into two groups! The thieves won’t know the layout of the castle as well as we do! You lot, flank them!
Calm down everyone, we can capture them in no time, so stay calm!
Assistant-kun, behind you! An attack is coming!
Princess Iris is right ahead! Instead of letting them through, we should kill them right here! We can ask Aqua-dono to use resurrection on them afterwards!! Rain, just do it!
Snipe!
Hyaa?
Who is that guy? Why is such a skilled person resorting to thievery?
– Iris’s room is right ahead. Big Boss, please place a web here.
Understood. My mana’s almost depleted, so this is the last one.
Intruders, you actually made it this far? Protecting the people, the country, and the royal family is the duty of house Dustiness, so I’ll…
Don’t shut the door! What did you come here for…?
B-Big Boss! Stop shivering and get to work! No matter how strong the female crusader before us looks, there’s no need to be surprised! We have something important to do for the sake of this kingdom!
T-T-That’s right, Assistant-kun! We still have a job to do for the sake of this country. It might be shady, but this is definitely for a just cause!
That’s the way, Big Boss! The people in this kingdom don’t realize how dangerous the accessory on Her Highness’s body is! If not for us, the princess will be in danger!
Assistant-kun, let’s charge in, we’ll apologize for it later!
That’s right! We’ll be forgiven if we explain the situation after the fact!
Hey, hey…! W-What are the two of you…?
What’s the matter, Darkness? I already told you plenty of times that you have to prevail verbally before fighting the battle.
Make way, it’s just a couple of thieves, I’ll capture them! I haven’t recovered enough to use magic, but I’m confident in a brawl! This afternoon, I even defeated three… Delinquents…
So, so cool…!
What should I do, Darkness? This chivalrous thief really knows his stuff! Wearing such a cool mask and black attire! What about the name? Is the name of the thieving group decided yet?
… D-Damn it, villain… Behind me is… As a member of house Dustiness, I…
Bind!
Sacred Spell Break!
Too bad, but it’s over for you with me around! I don’t know why you’re here, but if I seize you two, I’ll get some great wine! As you can see, I can neutralize any spells! Just give up obediently!
Darkness, now’s your chance! Apprehend them! Megumin became a coward for some reason, so it’s all down to you now!
Big Boss, we can’t stay too long because of that idiot here! Iris’s right in there, we just need to charge in and use Steal…!
We can then steal the divine relic! But, your skill…
Cut the web open! The objective of the villains is Her Highness Iris!
W-With my full powered horizontal slice, I’ll bury you ruffians!
Really Darkness, why are you so stupid? Why are you telling them your move? That’s why you’re known as a muscle head!
… Ugh.
Intruders, I’m a member of the powerful royal family and inherited the bloodlines of heroes! Don’t think you can… Easily…
Steal!
Princess Iris! Are you all right?
Assistant-kun, head for the balcony! It’s a swimming pool down there, so if we jump in there…!
From what happened, I finally know your objective’s that thing! I don’t know what that is, but don’t think you can take it away so easily!
Seal–!!
Shit, ahhh!
D-D-Darkness, please, calm down! There’s a reason for this, ahhh! It’s cracking, it’s cracking, my skull’s going to explode!
Hey, listen to my explanation! After listening, you’ll understand that this is for a good cause! Please, listen to me first! I can’t take it if you use any more strength, I’ll die!
I’ll listen! I’ll listen, all right? Right, I’m listening! This is just preparation before I listen to your explanation! I’ll judge after listening to your explanation whether I’ll strangle you two to death!
Dark-Darkness! I can’t talk! I can’t talk like this!
Stop! I was coerced by Chris; the mastermind’s the Big Boss Chris!
H-How can you say that? Ow, ow! N-No, listen to me Darkness! Assistant-kun was really eager to do it! I was the one who proposed it, but when I wanted to withdraw after things blew up, Assistant-kun was the one who insisted we continue to break through!
That’s not right, Big Boss! I only joined the thieving group for one day! I’m just a minion with no status in the organization!
What thieving group? It’s just me and you! What hierarchy is there with just the two of us?
Hey.
?
Spit it out.
– You two are really… Why didn’t you tell me? If you just told me about it clearly from the start, you wouldn’t need to do something so foolish. I would’ve definitely helped the both of you.
Even if you say that… That’s a divine relic that can swap bodies, all right? If used well, immortality would be possible. When I heard about this, I wanted to inform the big wigs too. However, Chris said the more authority a person has, the more they’d crave for this, and even royalty would abuse this divine relic…
I-I thought it’d be fine to tell Darkness! When I suggested asking Darkness for help, Assistant-kun said: ‘Hey stop! Darkness is a noble, if Chris’s real identity is revealed to the nobles, she’ll be placed in a bad situation.’. And so I changed my mind!
Ah! W-Why, you!
It’s too late for that now. Luckily, only I know about the real identity of you two. Chris, your silver hair is too prominent, so you should leave the capital as soon as possible and return to Axel. Kazuma… Return to the castle with me immediately.
Hmm? … Ah, you grabbed me too tightly just now, it still hurts! Sorry, let me rest here for a while…
Stop acting dumb and follow me! We’re going to pick up Aqua and Megumin and bid farewell to Her Highness Iris.
Even if you say that, I don’t dare go to the castle now that it’s on high alert after last night…! There’s no guarantee that things won’t go wrong. If I’m suspected and they bring out that lie detecting magic item, I’ll be done for!
Well, work hard, Assistant-kun! And the divine relic’s been sent to a place where it can never be stolen, so don’t worry. I-I’ll make a move…
… Wait, Chris.
? W-What is it?
Is that all of your secrets? Do you have anything else you want to tell me?
… Ugh.
Seems like there is! So, what else are you keeping from me? I’ve known you for a long time, so I know your habits when you’re in a pinch! That’s right, you’ll scratch the scar on your cheek! Tell me quick! What secrets are you keeping from me?
Assistant-kun stole something other than the divine relic!
Ahhh! You traitor!!
You criminal scum! What else did you steal? Now you’re a real thief! Hand it over! What exactly did you steal?
Why you…
Ah… Right, he stole that too.
Hmm?
… Oh? Is there something else?
Oh, ahhh! And this thing too! Back then, I used Steal on Iris…
…? Y-Y-You…? You actually stole that from Her Highness Iris?
Yes, yes I did… What, don’t be so alarmed, your shocked expression is scarier than your angry face! This isn’t anything important, right? Hey, are you trying to intimidate me?
Listen well, Kazuma. Don’t ever lose this ring, you hear me? And don’t let anyone know about this. Take it to your grave.
Hey, don’t say that! S-Since it’s something so important, I’ll just say that I happened to find this on the street and return it, okay?
You fool! This is something the children of royalty will wear all the time, and will only be removed as a gift for their partner in marriage! Lying about it being picked up by an adventurer on the street after it was stolen, this preposterous lie’s too…! … Even if you return it out of goodwill, you’ll most likely be killed to keep the news from leaking out.
What the hell, that’s scary! Ah, Chris! Where do you think you’re going? Take responsibility for involving me in this troublesome problem! Sneak into Iris’s room and return the ring!
That’s too scary! I don’t wanna! Why do you always steal something you shouldn’t with your skill? And Darkness, you’ve changed. You’re actually thinking of hiding this? You were so inflexible in the past… Are you more flexible in handling matters…? But I’ve got a feeling you’ve been deeply poisoned by Assistant-kun!
What…? W-Wait! I don’t feel that way! Did I really change? Is it so bad that I don’t have time to worry about how much Princess Iris’s been poisoned by Kazuma?
… Can’t be helped. I’ll bury it on the way back to the mansion so no one will ever find it.
Don’t talk nonsense! That’s something so important that Her Highness Iris keeps it with her all the time! No matter what, you have to keep this ring on you and cherish it, and also make sure no one ever finds it!
What kind of punishment game is this? Sigh, I understand. Then return that book to me. You can’t return that thing to the castle now anyway.
Hey, walk properly! How can you be so dejected before Princess Iris?
Eh… Oh… What…? There’s no need to burn it… That was the only reward I got from silently saving the kingdom…
Stop complaining! How unsightly. The lighter you invented was put to good use back then. That’s a great item.
I didn’t invent the lighter for that… Ugh… Ugh… My precious…
… If I bring you in when you’re in such a condition, I think you’ll screw things up. I’ll explain about the divine relic, so you only need to properly stand there.
… Then why’d you bring me along? My mental condition isn’t stable right now, so if you leave me alone, I might just do something in the castle.
Are you a kid? It can’t be helped, so you better not do anything unnecessary! I’ll explain the danger of that relic, and act out a scene, suggesting the idea that ‘the objective of the chivalrous thieves was to save Princess Iris!’ That’ll be enough! Don’t create any more problems!
Moron! Can’t you even knock? … Your Highness Iris, this is Dustiness here! I’ve something urgent to consult with you!
Hmph, with me around, there’s nothing to worry about! That dangerous divine relic’s been sealed by me and can’t be used! So rest easy! And that thief really targeted something amazing, huh?
As a magic item expert of the Crimson Demons, I can guarantee that no one will be able to craft a divine relic of that level. This means that the incident is resolved!
As expected of Aqua-dono and Megumin-dono, we can finally rest easy! When I heard about the true powers of that magic item from Aqua-dono, my face turned green!
… Speaking of which, what could the motives of these thieves be? From their reputation, they don’t seem to be people who’d misuse the divine relic… Hmm? Lady Dustiness… And even this guy’s here?
After their investigation, everyone knows how dangerous the divine relic is… We don’t need to act anymore.
… Maybe the two of them were here to save me? They knew about the danger of that necklace, but were afraid that someone might target that divine relic if they told someone about it…?
Princess Iris, that’s unlikely. The citizens might hold the chivalrous thief in high regards, but they wouldn’t take the risk to break into the royal castle for such a noble reason.
… If that’s true, the two of them deserve our respect…
Speaking of which, just who are the two of them? I thought I had a good grasp of powerful adventurers, but I don’t know where they came from. Especially that masked man… I only faced off against him for an instant, but he broke my staff from a great distance in that short moment.
That masked man, huh? He’s really cool, right? And that mask and all black clothes! It really moved me! Next time we meet, I’ll ask for his autograph!
Me-Megumin-dono, he’s still a criminal… Still, but that masked chivalrous thief’s really strong… He subdued Mitsurugi-dono in an instant, despite being unarmed; I heard he took out half the knights in the castle…
What’s the matter, Kazuma? Why are you laughing so disgustingly?
That’s right, what’s with your stupid grin? Such a pity, your chance to catch the chivalrous thief is gone… But even if you had the chance, you’d be no match for that masked man, sigh… Really, why’s that masked man working as a thief? If he wasn’t a criminal, I would’ve taken him in… We’ll meet again one day…
That chivalrous thief’s really handsome!
The following’s my assumption: The two of them only took action because they were worried about me… Maybe, I’ve fallen for that chivalrous thief…
Where could he be right now…? That silver-haired leader…
… O-Onii-sama, I have a request.
Y-Your Highness Iris?
Princess Iris, please allow me to make a request first.
This Satou Kazuma has indeed defeated many Demon King’s Generals. He might even be the one who defeats the Demon King. Doing so will be very difficult, not something anyone can do… May you give some words of encouragement to this brave one who’s taking on this highly impossible obstacle?
… Defeat the Demon King? Really? Onii-sama, are you planning to defeat the Demon King?
Eh, ah, if there’s a chance, I might consider subjugating… The Demon King…?
Is that so…? Onii-sama can surely do so. Please work hard in subjugating the Demon King… May onii-sama be victorious in all your battles!
Stop it with the ‘onii-sama, onii-sama’! You already have your own blood related onii-sama! Why are you so intimate with him? You’re weakening my reason for existing if you keep using that term! I’ll bury the Demon King then! No need for Kazuma to go!
O-Onii-sama’s onii-sama! What’s wrong with me calling onii-sama as ‘onii-sama’? And it’d be meaningless for you to defeat the Demon King! I want onii-sama to be the one who defeats him!
I told you to stop it with the ‘onii-sama’ and you start repeatedly saying it, are you looking for a fight?
W-Wanna go? R-Royalty are very strong!
Hey Megumin, stop! You had such a good relation with the princess just yesterday, but you’re quarrelling with her now? What are you trying to do?
Your Highness Iris, please calm down! You’ve never quarreled with anyone before, why are you doing that so suddenly?
… Well then, what’s your request? You can ask for anything.
Request… My request is…
We’ve yet to settle the match for our game. Please do so with me one day, okay?
Hey, Max… Get up Max!
Yee– Yee– W-What is it, Alderp? You looking for me? Ah, your emotions are tasty today too, Alderp!
If not for my problem, who would come to you… There’s a job for you. My divine relic has been stolen by a thief and sealed. You’re to get it back and unseal it, understand?
Yee– Yee– Alderp, Alderp! This is impossible, Alderp! I don’t know where the divine relic is, and it’s normally impossible to seal them. If it’s sealed, I can’t do anything about it…?
You can’t even do this, you piece of trash? Just when are you going to grant my wish? Lalatina! You should’ve brought Lalatina over by now! Why can’t you even do something so simple?
Yee– Yee– Yee– Yee–
Lalatina! Lalatina! You are mine, Lalatina! Do you know how long I’ve been watching you? Lalatina!
Yee– Yee–! Yee– Yee–! You’re the best, Alderp! I really like the way you’re true to your desires and your cruelty! I really want to fulfill your wish as soon as possible and collect my price, Alderp! Come, give me work to do, Alderp! Tell me your desires quick, Alderp! Alderp!
I’ve only one wish! Bring me Lalatina! She belongs to me!
Your Highness Iris… Please don’t be too sad…
I understand that Your Highness had a happy and wonderful time when that guy came here. But… That guy lives in a different world from nobles, after all. If you invest too much emotionally in a man, you’ll feel devastated when the time comes for you to marry. If you wish to scold me, please feel free to do so. But Princess, you have to understand…
I’m fine, please raise your heads.
…! M-My deep apologies! Because of my incompetence, your precious ring’s…!
I’m ready to take any punishment to make up for this mistake…!
The two of you have done your best. The thief managed to escape despite the congregation of powerful adventurers here, so no one could’ve stopped the ring from being stolen. When my father returns, I’ll ask him not to punish you two. So don’t treat this matter too seriously, all right?
Thank you for your clemency, princess… Not only did you lose your important ring, but you also have to be apart from that person… Your Highness Iris, if that guy manages to vanquish one of the Demon King’s Generals again, you can meet with him once more…
You’re right; I think that I’ll meet him again soon.
By the way, after seeing how Princess Iris was acting, I thought you would’ve said something willful when you parted with Kazuma-sama, and had steeled myself for that… But you handled it smoothly. I was worried about Kazuma-sama’s negative influence, but thankfully, you didn’t behave that way.
After all, I already made a promise with onii-sama.
Promise…? Ah, you mean the part about settling the match next time? Your Highness, you must defeat that man, all right?
I hope… Onii-sama keeps that ring carefully.
Ahhhhhh!
Hey, you’re noisy. You’ll disturb the neighbors, go to the suburbs if you want to shout.
Stop joking with me, bitch! You’re always getting in my way during the crucial moments! If you didn’t bring up something stupid like the ‘Demon King’, Iris would’ve requested for something else! Like wanting to be together with onii-sama, wanting to date onii-sama, wanting to sleep with onii-sama or something!
You just said something incredible! Don’t forget that Princess Iris is just twelve!! And she wouldn’t make those requests! At the very most, she would ask you to be the official court jester. Also, you only lived together with Her Highness for just a week! Why are you so confident that you’ve won her heart in such a short time? Face reality… Here, I made some tea for you, drink it and calm down.
Don’t pull me away from my fantasy life with the princess so suddenly! I don’t want to hear your logic! We just bid farewell, give me some buffer time to get over it!
You too, Megumin? I know you’ve got a short temper, but that last quarrel wasn’t necessary, right?
That was just an unavoidable battle between fellow little sister type characters, and I don’t want to lose either. Actually, things were going fine when I went out on a trip with the princess. However, we didn’t finish the task we set out to do because she picked a fight with ruffians. That’s a farewell gift that fits my style, right?
Megumin, what are you writing? … I know, it must be a letter to the princess, huh? After the party ended last night, you even went to her room and chatted with her a while. She even addressed you as Megumin-nee; I think you two are really close.
Wrong, this is a fan letter, so I can give it to that masked chivalrous thief if I ever meet him in the future.
Hack…! Cough…! M-Megumin, just what do you like about that masked thief? A fan mail isn’t appropriate, right? That guy’s a criminal.
I really like him though. After all, not many people have such good taste in this day and age. Even in the eyes of the Crimson Demons, that strange attire was out of this world. And they were invincible in their rampage through the castle, even though there were just the two of them. I even thought of standing on their side. This isn’t a love for the opposite sex, but the feeling of wanting to cheer for a hero I looked up to.
Hey, that smells nice, give me some too.
… You mean: ‘Aqua-sama, please spare a little wine for this humble one’– Right?
Hey, stop your futile resistance! Just give in!
No! Please! Spare me! Please, I’ll do anything!
… I’m willing to play, let me enjoy that kind of play…
Play your ass! You were so cool in the castle and now you’ve become like this? … Damn, hey Aqua!
I’ll go find the delicious wine from Michael-san that’s even praised by the capital. Then we’ll make a bet with our wines. You did well for this incident too, so I’ll give you a handicap on how we’ll bet.
… Really? Kazuma’s so eager to have a bet with me on who to buy the wine? There must be something up your sleeve.
Look, no matter what you say, we still resolved a crisis in the capital, right? And we made it back home safely, which is cause for celebration. After all, one bottle isn’t enough for the three of us.
Wait a minute, you said bottle for three, so you are planning to let me drink juice alone? And what do you mean by return safely, didn’t Kazuma die to kobolds?
S-Shut up, you! In the end I’m still alive, and that’s good enough! And it’s still too early for Megumin to drink! I’ll buy some nice ice cold Neroid, so just make do with that.
I’m old enough to marry! What’s wrong with drinking a little wine? Want to have a match to see who can drink more?
Hey, hey, Megumin, it’s better not to drink… But a celebration… Indeed, we stopped the conspiracy of some schemer out there. All right, I’ll cook up some snacks. It’s not a bad idea to host a victory party to celebrate our safe return.
… Hey, Kazuma hasn’t been back for more than a week, so forget about betting. I’ll bring some of my wine out and share it with everyone.
Well then, I’ll buy the wine. If I let Kazuma go, I think I’ll end up drinking Neroid.
The snacks are ready; we just need some tricks to hype up the mood…
Ah, hey Kazuma, may I borrow that ring for a moment? I’ll show you an amazing trick.
You little-! Why are you always like this?
That’s what I should be saying! Just what makes you so unhappy that you keep lecturing me? Is that your plan? Do you want me to notice you, you tsundere? If you like me, just come out and say it!
Who’d like a weak virgin hikikomori like you who always spouting nonsense fighting words!? I’ll teach you a lesson!
S-Stop it! I’m carefully polishing the precious ring Iris left with me! What will you do if it goes missing in the struggle? Didn’t you say this thing’s important?
I’m angry because it’s important! Don’t wipe the national treasure Princess Iris keeps on her at all times with your dirty handkerchief!
H-How mean!! Even I’ll feel hurt after hearing that!! This might be a cheap handkerchief, but I’m taking care of this ring filled with Iris’s feelings in my own way.
I’m not talking about the price of the handkerchief; don’t you use it to wipe your snot all the time? Buy a new polishing cloth!!
Really, being with you is so tiring. I’ve finally returned to this town, but I don’t feel rested at all.
That’s my line. You always stir up trouble but seriously lecture me from time to time. You barely reach the bottom of aristocracy, but you’re still a noble lady, right? Showing an air of a fine lady wouldn’t be bad for you.
B-Bottom of the aristocracy? You call house Dustiness, known as ‘the favored sword of the kingdom,’ the bottom of the aristocracy…? … You’re probably the only one in the world who’d say such a thing.
Hey, if you want to compliment me, make it easier to understand.
I’m not complimenting you.
… You were always like this. When I revealed my family background, you were more interested in my name than my social status… what a weird guy.
What’s with you, Lalatina? I don’t want to be called weird by a person like you. An unworldly noble lady, an adventurer, and a masochist. Just how many character traits do you want to hog, you greedy woman?
… Seems like I’ll have to settle things with you one day.
All right, all right, let’s have a match one day, young lady.
Hmm, this tastes good. You’re useless, but you do make some good tea.
Fufu, you said the dishes I cooked are average, but I’m quite confident in my tea. The key to brewing delicious tea is to warm the cup first and to pour it in until the very last drop. If you apologize for your crude remarks from earlier, I wouldn’t mind brewing another for you.
I get it, I get it, sorry for teasing you. It’s not much of an apology, but if you fall out of grace with nobility, I’ll hire you as a maid.
Falling out of grace is impossible! … Really, you’re a strange man. I thought you were a weakling, but you sometimes act really courageously. You’ll help others, but you’ll go play around at night and do disagreeable things. Which one’s the real you?
What do you mean by ‘real’? Everyone will do good things when they’re in a good mood, and urinate in public when they get angry. I’m just a normal person. Sorry for not being a rigid hero.
No, that’s fine. Or rather, instead of princes and heroes, I prefer an ordinary guy… For example, someone like you.
Hey, what do you mean? What was that? First Megumin, now you too? Why must the two of you tell me such vague things? Say it properly so a virgin like me can understand.
Why don’t you make a guess?
Well then, adventurer Satou Kazuma-san. The reason for calling you here today…
The payout was delayed because of the amount we needed to prepare… This is the bounty for the Demon King’s general Sylvia: three hundred million eris! This is the fourth Demon King’s general subjugated by you! Kazuma-san, you’re the ace adventurer of Axel’s adventurer’s guild! … Please accept this!
Ohhh!
Hey, take it easy everyone. This isn’t the first time I’ve taken out a huge bounty target, right? Really, just a mere three hundred million eris is… Hmm? Onee-san, you can let go now. I’m holding the bag really tightly, so it won’t drop. Really, hey…! Hey, let go! Let it go!!
But Kazuma’s team has already defeated four Demon King’s generals. I was worried that they might get wiped out some day, but they’ve really made it big now.
That’s right. They were a team that couldn’t even take down frogs not too long ago, but that Kazuma-kun’s now one of the few wealthy and successful guys in town. Truth is stranger than fiction, huh?
No, I’ve always felt that Kazuma was a guy who’d make it big when the time was right.
Weren’t you going on about a bet about when Kazuma’s team would get wiped out? … But they’re just amazing. Kazuma has the weakest job of Adventurer. He doesn’t have outstanding equipment, but he still managed to fight on par with the Generals of the Demon King’s army; that’s the incredible part.
Really. Hey, you won’t get anything from praising me like that, you know? … At most, I’ll just treat you to the best wine in the house!!
Ohhh, Kazuma’s so handsome!!
Hyaa–! Kazuma’s the boss! Marry me and feed me for life!!
The number one upstart adventurer in Axel!
As expected of Kazuma whose only strong point is great luck!
Hahaha, even if you flatter me… Hey, who’s the one that said I only have luck!? I’ve got many other strong points besides luck!
– Really! How could you do this, Kazuma? We were so worried about you after you didn’t  come back after so long, and here you are having a party here without us? And I even came here to check on you!
I’m partly at fault for not returning, but you’re the one who asked me to come alone, saying that nothing good could come from the guild summoning our entire team. Oh, here it is, the ice cold beer I ordered. For you.
Really, if you think my mood will turn better just by giving me some beer, you’re dead wrong. Megumin was pacing around the house and mumbling, ‘He’s still not back yet…’ every five minutes. Darkness was muttering, ‘Is it because of that? Did princess noticed the real identity of the chivalrous thief after all? Ah, what should I do to…?’ and something like that with her head in her arms! … Hah–! Hey, give me another beer!
I’m relieved that we were called for good news for once. Aqua wanted to bet on whether it was good news or bad news. She even said, ‘I bet three thousand eris that Kazuma committed a serious crime and has been arrested.’.
She also said that we should pack our bags and be prepared to run if you really got into deep trouble. The bags by Aqua’s feet are the evidence.
Are you kidding me? What the hell are you so worried about!? What’s with that bag? Hey, give me that refill!
Don’t wanna, order another if you want one! And it’s true that I was worried about you! You see, wouldn’t it be terrible if you weren’t with us? For example, …! Like… Like…? Hey Darkness, how would we be troubled if this guy wasn’t with us?
Stop your nonsense! How many times do you think I’ve cleaned up after all of you? I’ll give you a good whooping, get over here!
Ah, where are you pulling? The divine relic’s getting stretched out, stop! Stop!!
Really. Why’s Princess Iris so concerned about this noisy and uncouth man…? Hmm, personally, I think it’s because he’s a rare sight and she did so on a whim…
I wonder how Iris’s doing. I’m worried about her getting lonely and crying at night… Right, I should ask Vanir to make a doll that looks just like me. That guy did say the Vanir doll that laughs in the middle of the night’s a top seller. Let’s get him to make a Kazuma doll that’ll laugh in the middle of the night for Iris. That way, she won’t feel lonely at night anymore.
Hey Kazuma, don’t ever send such a creepy thing over! I can post letters for you, but not that! They’ll think you’re a terrorist!
– Hey, who’s the one that made this dish? Tell the head chef that adventurer Satou Kazuma, the talk of the town and the one who subjugated many bounty targets, is asking for him!
Tell him that the Archpriest Aqua’s here too!
M-May I ask if you have any feedback? Does something displease you?
No, I just wish to thank you and offer my compliments for the delicious meal. After enjoying the dishes in the capital, not many chefs can impress my godly tongue.
T-Thank you for your compliment.
You used grape wine in this stew, right? The bitterness is that of a red wine. The brand’s… That’s right, a thirty-year-old Romanee-Continue… Am I wrong?
It’s vinegar on sale that was just purchased.
… Is that so? To bring out such a taste with cheap vinegar, that’s amazing.
I’m truly thankful for your compliment.
The stew’s delicious, but my favorite would be this. This meat’s really soft. That’s right, if I had to use an analogy… This is like sneaking into the room of the girl you like, but when you open her cabinet with a pounding heart, it turns out to be a treasure chest mimic. That intense, unexpected impact… So, do you get what I mean?
Absolutely not.
Is that so? Anyway, it’s superbly delicious. I, adventurer Satou Kazuma, give this restaurant three stars.
I’ll give this restaurant three stars too.
Thank you. I’ll work hard to achieve four stars next time.
Ha, you have a way with words! The meal’s splendid; I’ll come again… As thanks for the delicious dishes, please keep the change. Thank you for the meal.
Thank you for the meal!
Although you paid the exact amount, I’ll look forward to your next visit. Thank you for your patronage.
I’m home…
Really, what a perverted Crusader! Here, you want this, right? Don’t endure it anymore, just give up…! … Ah.
I won’t submit for something like that! My honor as a Crusader is on the line, so I can take it even if it’s for an hour or two… Ah.
Don’t close the door! It’s not what you think!
No, no, it’s fine, I get it. Aqua and I’ll come back after dinner, so please carry on. If you want, we can spend the night outside.
The Axis Cult accepts love between members of the same sex. Do you need a blessing spell?
You completely misunderstand! This is, that, Darkness, she…
Ugh, to think there’d be an additional shame play…! Even if Kazuma and Aqua see my shameful appearance, I still won’t give in!
You’re making things more complicated, so shut up!
This isn’t any special play; Darkness is just asking me to help her train for the endurance competition. She’s apparently the winner in the annual Summer Endurance Competition in this town.
I feel both down and relief at the same time… But if you want to train, do it in Darkness’s house. You’re making the living room all hot and stuffy.
Actually, my father’s not feeling well recently. If he sees me doing this, he’ll be worried about what his daughter who has yet to marry is doing. I have to be considerate about his feelings…
Is your father unwell because you turned on the heater at home?
Phew… Kazuma and the others are back, so let’s call it a day. Thanks to Megumin, I discovered that raising my adventurer level will also improve my resistance to heat. I’ll definitely win again this year. Hey Kazuma, help me untie this.
You know, you look really similar to how I was when I was hit by a bind magic in Alderp’s villa right now.
…? Is that so? Maybe that really is. Er, let’s talk about this later. Untie me first. The blanket’s soaked in my sweat; I want to take a bath now.
We’ve been together for quite a long time, so you should understand my character by now. That’s right, I’m a man who’ll pay whatever is done to me back ten times… Hey, Darkness-san who toyed with me for a long time when I was immobile in the capital? You look really interesting today!!
Ugh! Just kill me!
–Sigh. My steaming, immobile body’s going to be toyed with by Kazuma…
Hey, watch your words. It sounds really lewd when you put it that way.
I plan to train tomorrow too. So Kazuma, do you want to play the role of the one flaunting the ice before me while I endure the heat?
Don’t wanna… I already said no, don’t look at me with such expectant eyes.
Really, where did the awe inspiring Darkness in the capital go? Last night, I went to the public cemetery to purify lost souls, all right? Everyone should learn from me who contributes to society every day.
… What’s that thing you’re cradling near your stomach?
Ara ara, you noticed so soon, Kazuma? All right, let me tell you. Don’t be surprised, okay? This is a dragon egg.
Dragon?
When I was house sitting some time ago, a merchant who heard about our exploits visited. He said, ‘it’s an honor to meet you! I’ve been searching for powerful adventurers who can fight on par with the Demon King’s army! Allow me to present you with my precious collection, just for your team that fights tirelessly without regard for your own safety against the Demon King’s army!’ He also mentioned that we’ll need a familiar like a dragon to prepare for our fight against the Demon King’s army. I think that’s a good point.
Listen well, all right? I’ll tell you since you’re an idiot without common sense: a dragon egg is difficult to obtain. Even when it appears on the market, some nobles or rich people will buy it immediately. Since someone’s willing to sell it to us, we have to buy, buy, buy, right? This is a dragon; you know? Aren’t you excited?
… How much did you pay for that egg?
Oh, he actually told me that it’d be fine to exchange all the money I had for it! Dragon eggs wouldn’t go for less than a hundred million, so I asked him why it’s so cheap. He said that he doesn’t want the dragon to be a symbol of wealth, but to contribute to the fight against the Demon King!
… And so, you bought it?
I bought it. I’ve already decided on the name. He’s Kingsford Zeltman. Since I’ll be raising it, it’ll be the emperor and a king among dragons. You can address this child as Emperor Zell.
In conclusion, I won’t take part in any quests before the egg hatches. Hey Kazuma, I can’t take my hands away now, so bring my dinner over and feed me.
– I’ll be back in a jiffy… Sorry for making you do this, Megumin.
It’s fine. Aqua refuses to go out if I don’t do this. And it’s true that only Aqua can fight on par with that devil.
Open the door! Open the door!! I say open up, it’s already morning! Your biggest clients are here! Quick, open up, open up!
Don’t make so much noise early in the morning! Think about the neighbors thee public nuisance woman! There’s still some time before the shop opens, so come back after thou wash thy face!
We’re not here as customers today, but have some other business! You’ll be busy when the shop opens, right? You should be grateful to us for coming early for your sake. Hurry up and thank me.
Hearing that thou who can’t read the mood is being considerate for moi is nerve wrecking. It makes one wonder what thou is scheming… Never mind, moi knows why thou art here. It’s for the payout of that upstart brat over there. Come in and wait, moi will bring it here shortly.
Say your thanks to me! Say, ‘I’m very grateful that you made time for a useless devil like me’!!
Moi already said thou art noisy! The shop owner who stayed up working for consecutive nights is sleeping, so be quiet! If thee tarnish the reputation of moi shop by being rowdy, moi will curse thee with aloe growing from thy butt!!
Just try it if you can! You think a curse from a small fry devil like you will work on me? Are you dumb? You said the mask’s your true body, so then where’s your brain?
Hahaha! Hahaha!! As expected, moi has to settle things with thee. All right, let’s take it outside!
Don’t bicker every time you meet! And what’s this about Wiz working consecutive nights? Is business that good?
Yes, this is what it means by laughing all the way to the bank. Since production’s equal to sales, moi made the shop owner work in the counter during the day and manufacture the goods at night for about two weeks without eating or sleeping. Recently, she started crying and laughing for no reason and was emotionally unstable. Since she couldn’t attend to customers, moi allowed her to rest.
H-Hey, you…
Moi had an epiphany. A way to deal with the shop owner who’ll mess up and run into debt if moi leaves her alone. After observing her recently, moi realized that woman will do something unnecessary if she’s idle. And so, moi tried making her work 24 hours without even time to eat, and it was very effective.
Speaking of which…
Hey, the one who’s been free all this while. The lust is accumulating in thy mature body over time. Even though thou art a virgin, every night–
What are you saying?!!
… Yes, the top notch negative emotion of shame are delicious indeed… Armor girl, thou have the ‘sign of destruction’ upon thee. Probably due to the brilliance from the annoying glowing woman beside, moi couldn’t see thy future clearly. In order to repay thy help in formalizing this huge deal, moi will tell thy fortune.
Hey, is that ‘glowing woman’ referring to me?
… Sign of destruction?
Nevermind that, tell me what you were about to say regarding what Darkness is doing every night!
Well then, let moi take a look. Little girl who has a strange sense of obligation from being a noble, but doesn’t have the capability and only wastes her time. Here, this way.
Hey Darkness, don’t trust in the divination of a devil. Instead of that suspicious thing, the advice from the elegant me will definitely be more beneficial.
Hmm. Moi divination isn’t something vague that can be explained in all sorts of ways like the will of the gods. As the devil who can see through everything, moi divination won’t lose to a professional diviner… All right, moi will ask thee some questions for now. There might be some questions that will be difficult to answer, but please answer truthfully.
I-I understand… But why’s an Eris devotee and Crusader like me getting my fortune told by a devil…?
It’s free, so there’s no harm listening. You just need to answer a few questions, right?
Hmm, so thou art ready? First, place one hand on this crystal ball… After that, thou just need to wait for a little while. So, please answer moi following questions honestly.
Ugh… I-I got it…
Well then. Pray tell, why did thou, a Crusader who values defensive power and requires weight to stand firm and resist attack, start reducing the weight of thy armor?
… T-That’s… B-Because I’m not agile, so I was thinking about reducing the weight of the armor so my attacks can land easier… I-I… Think…
Moi already told thee to answer honestly.
… I’m bothered by my abs becoming more and more defined, so I… reduced the armour’s weight…
True, true… Pray tell. Why did thou pose in the mirror with thy mage companion’s one-piece dress from the laundry basket and mutter a little happily, ‘Ah, this won’t do, it doesn’t suit me.’? Also, pray tell why thou were smiling so brilliantly with thy head tilted unlike thy usual solemn face, despite saying that that dress didn’t suit thou? And pray tell, why did thou check the surrounding with a blushed face and place the dress back in the laundry basket.
… B-Because, because cute dresses don’t suit me, so it’s embarrassing to buy them or ask someone to buy them for me. That’s why I’ve never touched them before… I saw it by chance and tried it on a whim… I-I’m sorry that an un-cute muscle woman like me posed with it… Sorry…
I think Darkness would look good in a cute one-piece dress! After all, you’re always wearing the cool type or mature type of dresses! You also wore an aristocratic lady style of dress before, so trying a cute one-piece is nothing much! There’s nothing wrong with Darkness trying out a cute dress in secret!
All right, the last question. Thou knew that the man who lives under the same roof as thee would look at thee with lewd eyes, but pray tell why thee wandered around the mansion in an attire that accentuates the curves of thy body–
What! What does this have to do with the divination?
Moi didn’t say the divination couldn’t be done without asking questions. Moi merely asked thee out of curiosity. The divination only requires thee to place thy hand on the crystal ball. Moi was just killing time with moi questions while waiting for the divination results… Hey, hey stop! Why art thou touching moi mask as thee please? Don’t attempt to unmask moi in tears!
… Hoho, I see. Yes, the sign of destruction. Thy family and father will meet with misfortune in the future. And then, thou who is stupid will think everything can be solved by sacrificing thyself, and take reckless actions. No one will be happy about that. Thy father will live in frustration and regret for the rest of his life. A good way to avoid it would be to…
… Ho, in conclusion, thou can’t do anything with thy strength. It’d be best to abandon everything and go. In a faraway place thou can start over with that man who’s thinking, ‘If I’m a bit more forceful, I should be able to do it with Darkness, right?’, but is too scared of crossing the line and compromising the current relationship.
Hey, hold it right there. Really now. Every time you open your mouth, my teammates’ trust toward me turns negative.
… Vanir, thank you for your divination. No matter what happens, I won’t run away… Well, I’ll believe half of what you said. Kazuma, you won’t be going out for quests any time soon after getting so much money, right? I’m not bothered by the divination, but I’m planning to return home to visit my father after being away for so long.
Hey useless devil, can’t you be more specific? And you were just saying that the signs from the gods are too vague. Tell my fortune too. Try divining what sort of dragon Emperor Zell will be. Would he have the power to rule over the dragons? Ah, also– I ran out of money after buying Emperor Zell, so teach me a way to easily earn money. You can see through everything, right?
This is moi first time seeing such an uncouth goddess. If moi had an easy way to make money, moi would’ve told the debt ridden shop owner and saved up the funds to build moi dungeon. Moi ability is to see what someone has done and what’ll happen to that person in the future. Nothing good will come of using this skill on thy greed… Thee don’t even understand this. Art thee really a goddess?
In the end, you’re just a self aggrandizing devil. Hah– How useless. Let’s go back, Kazuma. I’ll continue incubating Emperor Zell. After that child hatches, I’ll turn this devil into that child’s food.
… Oh, moi sensed a revelation. Thou can rename Emperor Zell to Teriyaki. It’ll be loved by everyone during dinner tonight.
Ara ara, what’s with that name? The one hatching from the egg’s a dragon, all right? I spent loads of money to buy it. Why should I give it a name that sounds so delicious?
I bet moi name, the devil Vanir who can see through everything, that the thing that’ll hatch from the egg favored by the cockeyed goddess will be delicious chicken meat…
Wait, the brat who wants to make a booking at that shop and spend the night outside after getting a large amount of money.
Dost thou remember what moi said to thee the first time we met in this shop?
… What you said? What about it?
To forget such important advice, thy memory is as bad as a goddess… Never mind, moi will give thee a new advice. Thou shouldn’t rest on thy laurels, and should continue to develop more merchandise. Thou think thou won’t be troubled by money anymore? I said to the Crusader girl just now that she can’t do anything with her strength… However, depending on the effort thou puts in, it might not be hopeless.
I’ll give you a piece of advice too. All the money you worked so hard to earn will all be recklessly squandered by Wiz in just a matter of days… How is it? How is it? This is the future the Aqua who can see through everything divined for you.
My apologies for intruding during a meal at such an hour. I’m here for Lady Dustiness because of a very pressing matter… Pardon me, may I take some of your time?
Since you’re addressing me as Lady Dustiness, that means you’re an envoy from some aristocratic house… I’ll humor you then. What’s this about?
My master, Alexei Barnes Alderp, seeks your presence. It’s not convenient to talk in a place like this, so I’ve prepared for a carriage outside. We can discuss the details in my master’s mansion. This way please.
… I’ll be going out for a bit. If I don’t return after it has gotten late, lock the door… Well then, I’m off.
… What’s with that guy?
He mentioned Alderp. That’s the name of the landlord old geezer, right? I’m not certain, but did she get involved in something weird?
If Darkness is going out, I’ll take the rest of her hamburg steak. Hey Megumin, can you feed me today? Kazuma’s terrible at feeding. He even shoved a spoonful of stew into my nose yesterday.
It’s almost summer and you still won’t shed. You’re not like a cat at all… Hey, what do I need to do to return you to your original form? You’re in that situation, right? Your cat appearance is just a disguise, correct? You’re actually a beautiful cat-eared girl who ends her sentence with ‘nyaa’, am I right?
Let me make this clear first: I don’t hate inhuman beauties, and won’t dislike you no matter if you’re human or not. Even if you transform into a pretty girl and I find you in my blanket naked in a cold morning, I won’t panic at all. And of course, you can keep staying in this mansion even if you’re not human, so don’t worry. Not just that, I’ll grill delicious fish for you every day too.
Oh, you reacted to the word fish, glutton? Listen up, Chomusuke. If you transform into a human, your size will increase and you can eat more fish. You understand?
Nya~
Good, good, good, you’re a cutie after all. Stay this way after assuming a human form, all right? Don’t join the ranks of those regrettable heroines. If you stay good, I’ll treat you to the meat of a chicken that just hatched.
Kazuma! Let’s go hunt a bounty monster!!
… What are you saying after playing outside until morning? It’s none of my business who you choose to fool around with, but you’re still an unmarried daughter of a noble house, so don’t go too wild, okay?
Moron, I didn’t spend the entire night raving! I thought it’d trouble all of you if I came back in the middle of the night, so I went back to my home! Anyway–!!
Hurry, look at this!
… Bounty monster Kowloon Hydra? … What’s this, a monster like the Orochi?
Orochi?
Kowloon Hydra. This fellow lives in the hills near Axel, a big bounty target that usually lies dormant. It’ll hibernate in the bottom of the lake after exhausting the mana inside its body, and will absorb mana from the land around it. The hydra will need ten years to replenish its mana as it hibernates. The last time it did so was about ten years ago.
You say you want to hunt this thing…? It might be foggy outside, but stop dreaming. And what was with that butler yesterday? Megumin was worried that the unworldly Darkness would just follow some weird nobles to some place and have bad things done to you.
Last night…! Last night’s incident has nothing to do with you all. It’s just some squabble between the nobility, so don’t interfere unless you want to be dragged in. Anyway, where’s Megumin? She’ll definitely be hyped about this, right?
Megumin and Aqua went out. They wanted to prepare a cool collar for the dragon that’s going to hatch.
Aqua asked me to help her build a small house for the dragon after it hatches, but no matter how I look at it, that egg…
It looks like a chicken egg… Anyway, I won’t hunt something like that, all right? If you want, just go with Megumin and Aqua. I won’t go even if you cry and make a scene as usual.
When did I ever make a scene? … Actually there’s been reports that there was something wrong with the lake a few days ago. It seems that weeds have started growing out of the barren land around the lake. This means that the Hydra doesn’t need to absorb mana from the land anymore, which is a sign that it’s awakening.
… Listen well, Kazuma. The only ones who can save this city is our team that has taken down the generals of the Demon King’s army! You’re also an adventurer in this town, right? You want to protect this land, right? … The hero who defeated numerous Demon King’s generals, Satou Kazuma! See, now’s your chance to shine!!
You think I’m a moron who’ll charge forth after someone swoons over me and calls me a hero? You should at least understand this much after spending so much time together with me. Don’t you have anything else that’ll motivate me? By the way, I’m not talking about money, all right? I’ve got plenty of cash anyway. Think about it, there are other ways to get my attention, right?
… I-I get it… I’ll give you a reward that’ll make you happy after defeating the Kowloon Hydra. Erm… A k-kiss to your cheek.
Are you retarded? I’m not a kid. Who’d risk their life for a kiss in this day and age?
?
Just the thought that a mere kiss has such an exaggerated value irks me. Or rather, just how highly do you see yourself? Did the flattery from the nobles in the capital get to your head?
Why, you, you…!
Hey Chomusuke. This onee-san thinks that there’d be a guy who’ll risk his life for her, huh? Just how highly does she see herself? Really, isn’t there a better way to entice others?
Nya~
Oh, I see, you think the same, huh? That’s right, there are plenty other ways. right?
Don’t be cocky! Put the cat down, I’ll kill you!
Oh? What is it, is brute force the only method you know? I have the skill Bind now. If I use that, you’ll be tied into a dumpling in an instant. Do you want to experience ticklish hell again? If that’s what you want, bring it on!
… Bind, huh? You even learned that skill before I realized it. O-Okay. No problem, let’s spar then. If you can bind me, I’ll let you do as you wish just like that time a few days back. But I won’t give in just because you tie me up and toy with me a little!
What are you so happy about? And I don’t need to go anyway, all right? Just bringing Megumin along. No matter what that is, one shot from Megumin’s spell will finish it off. If that doesn’t work, just run away. In the end, Hydras are a subspecies of dragons, right? The scales are tough, so the powerless me can’t do anything…
S-Say… Will you really not help?
Hey, what if we fail to defeat the Hydra? If we attack now, won’t the worst case scenario be us aggravating a docile monster?
No! I don’t want that!!
That isn’t a problem. The way to fight the Kowloon Hydra in the past was to surround it with an army and make it exhaust its mana by rampaging around. After depleting its mana, it’d hibernate again. And of course, the capital’s keeping track of it’s schedule will be sending a Knight Corps over soon.
I don’t want this Hydra or whatever!! Why must Darkness aim for this bounty monster? Kazuma occasionally mentions this, but are you really an impoverished borderline noble? I’ll smash the piggy bank containing the money I worked so hard to save and lend it to you, so can you just bear with it a while more?
But the Hydra has awakened before the Knight Corps is scheduled to arrive. Also, the Knight Corps can induce the Hydra into deep slumber, but they can’t finish it off. In that case, the root of the problem remains unsolved. That’s why you’re asking me, who’s defeated countless foes, correct?
Let me go back! Hey, please let me go back! I’ve got a bad feeling about this!
Fuhaha, leave this to me! Hydras might be a subspecies, but they’re still lesser dragons. After defeating it, I can call myself a dragon slayer! I wanted the title of dragon slayer in the past, so I blew up a wyvern, which is also related to dragons; but it was a youngling, so it wasn’t recognized as a kill. I’ll take the title of dragon slayer for sure this time.
All right, first off…
I still need to go back early to witness Emperor Zell’s birth! Waaahhhh!!
Oh, shut up and stop griping! A chicken egg needs twenty days before it hatches, so it’s still early! And it’s about time you give that up. If you go back, who else can wake the Hydra?
Why would a chicken hatch from a dragon egg? And why must the important Emperor Zell be entrusted to that sort of place?
We had no choice, we couldn’t ask someone else to do something as stupid as incubating an egg. If we’d asked an adventurer we know to do that, there’s a high chance it’d be eaten.
But, but, how can I pass the egg to a lich and a devil? I’m worried about them negatively influencing Emperor Zell who’s about to hatch! Dragon eggs will have higher mana and take more traits from their parents the longer they’re held! I’m hoping the child will be a holy white dragon, but wouldn’t it be affected by dark powers and hatch into a black dragon?
Even if it’s black, it’ll just be a crow. If you’re that worried, then help us take down the Hydra quickly and go back. If we can’t beat it with Megumin’s magic, there won’t be any other way. We’ll just have to run then.
All right, are you ready? Well then, let’s begin, Aqua!
You guys can’t do without me, huh? Personally, I don’t hate the act of purifying water… I’ll be back in a jiffy! If Megumin’s spell doesn’t work, you have to escape immediately, all right?
… She’s purifying the water? Isn’t she just playing in the water because it’s too hot?
I’m bothered by that too. I thought it was just another one of her party tricks, so I didn’t comment on it.
According to her, the reason is because she’s the goddess of water.
This is…! It’s here, it’s here! I can feel powerful mana clearly! The source’s coming from the bottom of the lake!
Hey, this is larger than what I was told! It was supposed to be the size of a large mansion, but this is much bigger than our home!
K-Kazuma, Kazuma! Something humongous is chasing after me!
It’s coming! Megumin, ready your spell! Darkness, stand before Megumin and defend us if anything happens! I’ll secure our retreat route!
Leave the defense to me! But there are no other monsters, so securing the retreat route’s unnecessary!!
I-It might be larger than expected, b-but I’ll settle it with the power of my explosion magic! Watch me destroy the entire ecosystem of this lake!
Whatever, just hurry up!
–Kyree! –Kyreeee!!!!
I can’t deal with this shit.
Oh Kazuma. Your death was really pathetic!
… You’re in a great mood, Eris-sama.
Sorry. I’ve always wanted to try saying that famous line once.
By the way, Kazuma-san, you aren’t frantic at all even though you’re here… Well, the others are safe, they’re far away from the Hydra right now. Your corpse has been retrieved after Darkness let the Hydra swallow her.
Intentionally letting the Hydra swallow her… That girl’s really reckless.
Speaking of which, what the hell was that? That’s cheating, growing back the heads it lost; there’s no way we can defeat that, right?
What happened to my body after I was eaten by the Hydra? I heard that you can’t revive if the damage is too severe…
Eh… I-It’s fine! You can revive!! About thirty percent of the body’s lost, but it’ll work!
… E-Erm…!
After you resurrect, please don’t be blame Darkness, all right? She was the one who wilfully brought it up … But she had her reasons too… She’s blaming herself for your death right now and is taking it really hard. Of course, the one who suffered the most is you…
Don’t worry, I won’t blame her… Anyway, Eris-sama, you mentioned that you’ll go down to the mortal world occasionally to have fun. How about visiting Axel? It feels lonely to not be able to meet you unless I die…
Actually, we’ve already met plenty of times in the mortal world. It’s about time you notice me, okay? I feel a little lonely too.
What did you say? We met? Was it in Axel? Hmm?
I’ll give you a hint, then. In the mortal world, my appearance is different from now. I’m more energetic, and my manner of speech is different.
And even though I’m a goddess, I don’t have to be an Archpriest in the mortal world like senpai…
Ah, I know! It’s Marise-san who broke Keith’s nose after he teasingly said, ‘I heard the breast size of Eris’s priests are inversely proportionally to their faith, so it’s true after all, wahahaha!’
… Wrong.
After Dust, who was looking for trouble, said, ‘I heard the goddess Eris wears pads, won’t her devotees get expelled for having large breasts? Are yours real? Or are the two of you wearing pads? If not, let me see it as proof!’, the one who beat Dust up together with Darkness, Celeste-san!
No.
Kazuma! Kazuma! The resurrection’s done, so hurry up and come back! Darkness is smelly and seems very depressed right now! Come back already!
Eris-sama, I give up! I give up, I’m sorry! Please tell me the answer, please! If not, I’ll receive divine retribution if I unknowingly do anything rude to you!
… You’re still talking about rude things and divine retribution now…? Even though you did all that the first time we met…?
Hmm?
Nothing. My real identity is a secret.
… Also, please don’t listen to everything senpai says, okay? A-At least right now, I’m not wearing pads!
Wait, Eris-sama, I’m sorry! You’re angry, right? Throwing a tantrum? No– I’m not really concerned about your breast size!
Well then, Satou Kazuma-san! I hope the next time I meet you after your life ends, you’ll know my identity! Fare well! Have a safe trip!
Hmm? Eris-sama, your face…
Welcome back Kazuma.
Puah! That stinks!
Me!? The stench is coming from me?
Did my clothes melt…?
They melted. Cover up. By the way Kazuma-san, you were digested so much that you became Ms. Kazuma at one point. Your defensive armour is totaled, the only thing that survived is your strangely named katana that was in its sheath.
What? I can’t ignore the fact that you said the katana I named has a strange name!
… And so, why are you so depressed?
Aren’t you angry about me forcing you to fight?
I’m not angry at all. You might be the one who wanted to fight, but this isn’t the first time we’ve fought high bounty monsters and generals of the Demon King’s army. I’ve already died a few times too.
That’s true…
Really, this isn’t like you at all. I’ve already heard about it from Eris-sama, okay? In order to save me after I was swallowed by the Hydra, didn’t you allow yourself to be swallowed too? On a closer look, you’re covered in blood. Are you all right? You don’t look melted though.
This blood is from the Hydra when I cut open its stomach from the inside after retrieving you. If I were to have spent any more time inside, I would’ve joined you too… It’s fine now, I’m not hurt anywhere else either.
Collecting back my corpse was a big help, thanks. Let’s not idle here anymore, let’s go back and shower, all right?
Hey Kazuma. It’s fine if you want to console Darkness, but it doesn’t feel right for you to ask someone to shower in that appearance.
– Still, I now know why the Knight Corps didn’t deal the final blow to the Hydra. It’s not that they didn’t want to, but they couldn’t.
The Kowloon Hydra can use magic to regenerate its lost heads. To defeat it, we’d have to use immensely strong firepower to blow it away beyond any chance of regenerating, or wound it numerous times to deplete its mana before dealing the final blow. Both methods are impractical…
Megumin’s right, there’s no way to do it this time. We’ll leave the Hydra to the Knight Corps. They’ll steadily deplete its mana and send it back to sleep. Darkness, you’re fine with that, right?
…Yeah.
Eh, it’s not all bad news, all right? Thanks to me, that Hydra won’t leave the lake any time soon! I purified part of the lake, so it’ll think its territory has been invaded, and will focus on polluting the lake with its miasma. The Knight Corps will be here before it’s done, so we can just dump the task onto them.
… Did you eat something wrong? You actually did a great job. That’s really smart.
Whenever Aqua’s filled with confidence, things will go badly in the end.
No, no, no, there shouldn’t be any problems this time. And it wouldn’t be our problem even if there is. After all, we actually bought some time for the Knight Corps.
That’s right, do you have any problems with my good work? Really, Megumin! If you say anything weird, I’ll let Kazuma or Darkness piggyback you, all right?
I apologize, please don’t do that, I beg of you!
I’ll go with Megumin to report to the guild; the two of you stink, so hurry back to shower. After all, Kazuma’s dressing might make someone call the cops!
Let’s go Megumin, we’ve got to exaggerate our actions as much as possible! That way, even if we can’t get the bounty reward, we can still earn some consolations!
Leave it to me, I’ll tell them just how powerful my Explosion is!
It’s really scary how I can get used to such things. I died just now, but I’m not panicking at all.
… Kazuma, you’re bathing longer than usual; does it hurt anywhere? Or have you not recovered your strength because you just revived?
N-No problem, I’m fine! You see, it stinks really bad, right? That’s why I’m carefully cleaning myself!
… Hey Kazuma. Erm, it’s my fault this time for being willful. Maybe things have been going too well recently and I got too impatient. But I want to defeat that Hydra no matter what…
Well, we won’t meet that thing again, so it’s fine. Anyway, Aqua and the others are really slow. They must be eating something good in the guild. Let’s go too.
… Ugh. Yeah… You’re right…
All right, I brought you a change of clothes. I’ll leave it here, okay? I’ll be waiting in the living room…
Do you have a hard-to-talk-about reason why you have to defeat that Hydra?
Ugh? T-That’s…
… It didn’t work today, but let’s come up with a proper plan to take on that Hydra next time, all right?
Hmm?
What,  you got on your high horse and talked about the safety of the people, but you are just going to give up on subjugating the Hydra?
What the hell are you talking about? Who do you think I am? Protecting the people is the duty of the Dustiness house! I’ll get that Hydra next time!!
Why are you people always doing unnecessary things?
That’s right! When Aqua-san changed the water in the fish tank into pure water last time, all the fish caught from the sea died, isn’t that right?
I-I thought it would be better if we did that! It was the same for the fish shop, the poor fish were living in a cramped tank, so I wanted to at least make their water cleaner!!
What should we do? We can’t handle a big shot like the Kowloon Hydra!!
Mama, I want to go home!
Wanted posters, post more wanted posters! Spread the posters to all the adventurers in town!
No, what’s happening here? Why are things so bad? I can see Aqua’s getting blamed, but we didn’t do anything wrong this time, right?
T-That’s right! The Hydra would’ve woken up sooner or later even if we didn’t do anything, so there shouldn’t be such a commotion, but…
Hey, what happened? The subjugation failed, but it’s not that bad, right? Isn’t this a subjugation that won’t be a big deal since the Knight Corps are coming?
W-Well, a big incident happened recently… The Knight Corps are busy dealing with it and didn’t have the time to come here…
Hey, what happened? A crisis in the capital? Is my cute sister in danger?
S-Sister? No, the incident happened quite some time ago and was sort of resolved without any major repercussion. The Knight Corps were sent to restore order in the chaotic capital and search for the criminal who instigated the incident…
From what I’ve heard, a duo calling themselves the Silver-Haired Thieving Group infiltrated the castle…
With just the two of them, they defeated the knights in the castle and powerful adventurers and boldly stole several treasures…
Two hundred million eris… Two hundred million eris…
Hey Darkness, why are you looking at me like that?
Eh, in summary, the Knight Corps that were supposed to be dispatched here won’t be coming any time soon.
However, there’s still hope. The knights from the capital specifically made a trip to the Crimson Demon Village and asked a highly skilled diviner to determine where the culprit had gone to… And the divinations showed that the main culprit’s right here in Axel! And so, the adventurers are zealously searching for the criminal right now!!
Anyway, I’m looking forward to Satou Kazuma’s team’s performance. After all, your team runs into bounty targets frequently! If you can capture the criminal, the Knight Corps can rest easy and dispatch a team over here!
You’re right.
Sigh, it’s only a matter of time before the culprit’s caught. We have a diviner even more powerful than the Crimson Demons’ diviner here in Axel!
In summary, please give us a hand too, Satou-san!
One day~ In the forest~ I met a~ Dragon~
Kazuma, revenge! I want to get my revenge against that Hydra!
You might be saying that now, but how are we going to defeat that monster? I thought about it a lot, but I can’t come up with a good plan.
Firepower! Use stronger firepower to blow its face up! If one Explosion isn’t enough, use consecutive Explosions to blast it to bits! Just like the time we fought the Destroyer, with Aqua’s mana and Kazuma’s Drain Touch, it’d be possible!
Don’t wanna. Why must I suffer the dirty lich skill, Drain Touch? I won’t ever do it again. That’s right, even if Kazuma threatens me, Darkness coaxes me, or Megumin acts strangely, I won’t do it. My holy mana isn’t meant to be carelessly used by others.
And what’ve you been doing with that holy mana all this while? You don’t need to keep cradling the egg, just warming it before the fireplace will be good enough, right? If it overheated, just treat it as a snack and eat it.
Hey you, I’ll give you a taste of my God Blow if you keep saying snacks or whatever… I’m injecting mana into a dragon egg. Dragons are the crystallization of mana, so they will be stronger if they have more mana. This child will rule over the dragons from the peak. As the parent raising this child, I want to do whatever I can for it.
By the way, why are you thinking of revenge, Megumin? Aside from Darkness, who displayed an abnormal obsession over the Hydra, do you have some history with that thing too?
Well, I’ve been thinking too. It killed Kazuma once before. Won’t I feel really happy if I defeat such an opponent?
Eh, oh… I-Is that so…?
Recently, I’d been going after the Hydra together with Darkness. Darkness would draw the Hydra out with taunting skills and we’d escape after casting Explosion. Even though we’re challenging it this way… Could there be a better strategy?
I was wondering why I didn’t hear the familiar sound outside the town recently; so you’d been doing that? It’s not showing any intention of attacking the town, so don’t aggravate it! And what are you doing, Darkness? Shouldn’t you stop her at a time like this?
It’d be inconvenient to make a move in this heavy rain, so it can’t be helped. The opponent lives in water; it’ll have the advantage if we fight in the rain. I’ll show my true strength after the rain stops.
It’s the rainy season right now, right? The weather diviner said that the rain will go on for quite a while.
… I’ll show my true strength when the rain stops.
This guy! So you won’t be motivated any time soon, right?
Ah, what are you doing, stop! Don’t vent your anger on Chomusuke!
We’re back! Sorry, it’s a little inconvenient for Darkness, so can you please prepare the bath?
… So you got eaten. Didn’t you two escape right after casting Explosion? It’s dangerous, so don’t go there anymore.
That fellow probably had enough of the daily Explosion and struck preemptively before I could use my taunt. Megumin was chanting Explosion the moment it attacked, it was a close call… After we got out, Megumin shot it with Explosion and we escaped as it was regenerating its head… It isn’t so simple after all.
… Hey Kazuma. Can’t you think of an easy way to finish off the Hydra? The strong point of the weak Kazuma’s your numerous half-baked skills and your ability to use despicable means to solve any problems, right?
Oh, I thought of one. We’ll bind you up with chains and throw you into the lake. When the Hydra eats you, we’ll gather all the adventurers and pull the Hydra to shore. We’ll then gang up on it and give it a good beating before it can escape back into the lake… How about it?
Well, personally, I have no complains about casting Explosion on strong enemies… But Darkness seems weird recently.
– Phew… Kazuma, what are you doing with my armor?
You really damaged your armour today, so I’m fixing it up for you. It’s been raining these few days and I’ve got nothing to do in the house anyway.
Speaking of which, you also fixed my armor when we went to the hot spring… I want to go on another hot spring trip with everyone one day.
I don’t wanna, I hate that city. There are too many people with their screws loose like Megumin.
Hey, say that again!
Even so, I want to go again…
Kazuma, she’s not here! She was already gone when I went to her room to wake her up!
That girl! I already told her not to go, why won’t she listen?
Why did you doze off!!
Wahhh! It’s tiring to incubate Emperor Zell! Raising a kid’s hard work, so be more considerate toward me!
Stop kidding me about raising a child! Hand that egg over! I’ll cook that damn thing nice and fresh!
I don’t care about that egg; Darkness is the priority!! What’s she thinking? Did she talk about how the obligation of a Crusader and the duty of the nobles is to protect the town again?
Now’s not the time to determine Darkness’s intentions. The Hydra’s also learning, and Darkness’s injuries are getting worse every day! It’s getting really dangerous for her!
Hey Kazuma. Is there no way to take out that Hydra? I’ll drop the egg off at Wiz’s shop, then chase after Darkness with Megumin to lecture her… You probably have a phobia against an opponent that killed you once, but, Kazuma, do you want to come along?
I’m going out somewhere, so the two of you go and try to bring Darkness back. Even if you encounter the Hydra, don’t engage and run straight back, all right?
That girl’s really a handful!!
Oh! You sure took your time, Lalatina!
Lalatina-chan’s here!
Lalatina!
Lalatina!
S-Stop it, Lalatina! Those guys were just calling your name, don’t silently start strangling me like that! Stop… Please stop!
Hey Kazuma, what’s happening here? If this is your new way of harassing me, I’ll give you a piece of my mind too.
That’s not it! Why would I gather so many people to do something so stupid? I just told everyone that you’re challenging the Hydra alone here every day and asked if they’d help you!
?
Oh, even Lalatina can get embarrassed.
Don’t say that. Lalatina-chan might look like that, but she’s actually very delicate, all right? To defeat the Hydra, Lalatina-chan’s strength is needed. What if you make her cry and run back?
Kazuma has been treating us to food and drinks recently; he even bought us the most expensive drinks yesterday! It’s only natural to return the favor. Let’s go along with Lalatina’s willfulness!
Take a good look, Darkness. I merely told them that you were doing something silly every day and managed to gather so many adventurers. I can’t do anything about your muscled filled brain, but don’t make others too worried.
T-Thank you…
Hmm? What did you say?
Everyone, I’m very–
Waaahhhh–! Kazuma, Kazuma–!! The Hydra woke up earlier than usual for some reason!
Like I said, it’s better to wait for Kazuma’s signal before waking the Hydra!
But, but!! I want to go back earlier to witness Emperor Zell’s birth…!
Why do you people always do that? This emotional scene is totally ruined!!
All thieves, did you bring your steel wire? Archers, standby with your grappling hook arrows!
Waaahhhh, hurry up! Hurry up!
Tough adventurers, protect the backline! Stand by as human shields!
Mages, prepare to fire off your magic and stand by! Use the most powerful spell you have! Don’t worry about saving for the next attack; use all the mana you have in one shot!
Leave it to me! I’ll blow that damn Hydra away with my Explosion this time!!
Darkness, use your Decoy skill right in front of the Hydra! Your toughness will be the key to this fight!! Don’t die too easily!
Who do you think I am? Other things aside, my defense won’t lose to anyone!
Hey, Kazuma! What about me? What should I do?
After casting support spells on everyone, you don’t need to do anything unless someone gets injured! Go and cheer them on, and don’t get in my way!
What? Let me play a big role too!!
Darkness, I’m leaving it to you!
You can count on it! Your opponent’s me! Decoy!
Bind!
If you won’t go down unless your mana dries up, I’ll suck you dry!
Great! It’s working, it’s working… Woah?
Get out of there Kazuma! Are you dumb? What the hell are you thinking, going way up there?
It’s fine, watch me use my secret skill to weaken this big fellow! Tell the mages to get ready to bombard once its mana’s depleted…!
Waaahhhh, I’m going to get squashed!
Moron! What are you doing?
As expected of Lady Dustiness, your arm power and endurance are marvelous.
Is this the time to say that? Ugh, I can’t, hold on…!
Darkness, not yet! Endure it and don’t let up! Stay in that position!
? You’re going for abandonment play now? N-No, I really can’t…!
You’ve always been useless! When your chance to be of use comes, are you going to let it end like this? Aren’t you planning to defend your title in the endurance tournament this year too? If you can’t even endure this thing, can you even win? How spineless! Can you show your shameful appearance before all the adventurers here?
Ugh, the Hydra’s heavy play and the verbal abuse play from this demonic man, what a reward this is…! Of all days, why does it have to be now…?
Pull, pull now!
I-I… Can’t… K-Kazuma… Don’t worry… We’ll die… Together…
How will that stop me from worrying? Don’t give up! In the end, I’ll be the only one who’ll die! You even received magic buffs and won’t die just by being crushed by the Hydra a little!!
I-If I give up, Kazuma will die… Ahhh, what’s with this situation…? Even though you’re ordering me to hold on like a master, your life’s in my hands, how contradictory…! Who’s the master in such a situation? This is a new feeling, a new feeling, Kazuma…!
Look, the Hydra’s becoming really weak, right? And it can’t move, either! I’ll take the head of the large bounty target, the Kowloon Hydra! The one who scores the last hit can collect the entire bounty, I don’t want to share it with anyone else!
W-Wait, what are you talking about in this situation? And even though it’s immobile, if you let down your guard because its necks are tied together… Ahhh! Dust! Dust!!
Light of Saber!
Hey look, the head that was cut off didn’t regenerate!
All mages!!
Attack!!
Light of Saber!!
Explosion’s coming! Everyone near the water evacuate!
Cover your ears!
Kazuma, I’ll avenge you now! A bouquet for the one in heaven…!
Explosion–!!
Admit my victory! I blew off six of the Hydra’s heads! Yunyun only cut off two! It’s obvious who has the upper hand!
W-What’s that Megumin, you were just waiting idly until the Hydra was pushed to the verge of dying! I even saved someone who was bitten by the Hydra, that should count too!!
Saving a delinquent who wanted to hog all the bounty should only count for one point. You’re a Crimson Demon too, so you should understand the importance of stealing the limelight!
Seems like we’re more capable than we thought! Ara~ But we wouldn’t have made it without Kazuma’s party.
That’s right, Kazuma’s great as expected! Even though we agreed the bounty for the Hydra would be shared equally, Kazuma’s group should take more. There’s a moron who said, ‘The one who scores the last hit can collect the entire bounty’, so you can take that share with you too.
Well then… Everyone must be tired after the intense battle with the Hydra, so let’s rest for today and drink our hearts out with the reward tomorrow!
Yeahhh!
Are you kidding me!?
Hey, how does it feel to defeat the Hydra you were so obsessed over? You can sleep soundly from tomorrow onward, right?
Yeah, thanks to this, all sorts of things seem trivial to me now. I think brooding over it by myself is silly. But that isn’t because we took down the Hydra.
I learned once again how much I like the people in town. Thanks to them, I found my way again. There’s nothing to be afraid of, nothing to regret.
You say some really embarrassing things sometimes.
I’m really blessed.
Really, show more reverence to me! Say that you’re very grateful to Aqua-sama for granting you a new life, compliment me more!
Hey Kazuma! I’m thankful for being revived, but the priestess from your party’s really annoying!
Adventurers! Thank you for your hard work yesterday!! Congratulations on the successful subjugation of the large bounty monster, the Kowloon Hydra! Everyone will receive a grand reward too!
Whoa!!
Speaking of which, we’re finally going to accept the reward, so why isn’t Darkness here yet? Did she forget about the party that’s going to be held today? Or is she still embarrassed about what happened yesterday?
That might be so. Last night, Darkness was much more tensed up than usual. She normally doesn’t drink much, but got dead drunk that time. She’d usually lecture me whenever I wanted to drink, but Darkness actually offered me some…
Darkness might be the eldest among us, but she’s like a child in many ways. She’s a useless child who gets shy easily, so it’s understandable why she won’t come out to meet everyone. Let’s buy some gifts for Darkness for taking care of the house.
Why are you nonchalantly treating Darkness as the oldest and making yourself look young? Aren’t you a grandma in terms of age?
I told you before right, Satou Kazuma-san? If you say something like that, you really will suffer divine retribution. I’ll curse you and the cold drink you ordered will become warm instantly.
Satou Kazuma-san’s team of four will receive eighty million eris, and with the request of all the other participants, they’ll receive an additional twenty million eris. Please accept this one hundred million eris!
Thank you very much! All right everyone! The twenty million eris will be used to treat… Hey, hey let go! Why are you so reluctant to give me the bounty? Hey, give it to me!
Hey everyone! Thank you again for the support yesterday! Let’s have a party!!
Ohhh!
–Hey Darkness, we’re… Back…? Hmm, where’s that girl? Did she go out?
Hey, stop asking. Even if the dishes are done, we have to wait for Darkness to come back, all right? And don’t just incubate the chick, help with the chores too. Are you cleaning the toilets properly?
Really Kazuma, I think you should be nicer to a woman raising a child. And stop calling it a chick. If you keep bullying this child, I won’t even care if Emperor Zell bites you after it hatches, all right?
Hey Kazuma, why isn’t Darkness back yet? I can’t hold it anymore with the food right in front of me. Hurry up and find Darkness, hurry up.
You didn’t fork out the money or cook the meal. Do you think you’re some kind of princess?
We put quite a bit of effort into the meal tonight. Even the noble lady Darkness won’t be able to eat something like this often. Fufu, I’m looking forward to her reaction after eating my dish.
Didn’t you only add some salt and set the dishes?
Hey Kazuma! The dishes are cold, go reheat them.
… The meal’s right before me, but I have to wait… I’m not Darkness, I won’t be happy with such a play… After she comes back, I’ll punish her by making her sit in front of the couch and finishing the meal in front of her.
I don’t think that’s really a punishment, it’s more like a… Frankly speaking, she’s too late. I’ve already told her that we’d be back before dinner, so what’s she doing? Was it just like Vanir divined and something happened to her house? Even so, she’d tell us what happened.
… She’s late.
She probably won’t return tonight. Really, at least give us a heads up if you’re not coming back… Hey, let’s eat.
Hey Kazuma, what’s that? What are you making?
I just have a rough idea of the principle and appearance, so I can’t craft the item because of the lack of materials; but I can still make a rough shape of it. Still, someone smart enough will find a replacement for nitroglycerin and buy this.
I see; bringing advanced weapon technology to this country, right? Kazuma… You really are scary…!
What’s the thing Aqua’s holding used for?
This is an imitation of a magic item called dynamite, used to recreate explosion magic.
?
The good thing about this is that anyone can use it and doesn’t consume mana. However, it can’t…
Fuahhh!
Ahhh? It took a lot of effort to make that! What are you doing?
How can I let something like this recreate the ultimate magic so easily? I won’t accept the development of deviant weapons!
T-This girl’s annoying…!
Darkness’s really going to leave the party, huh…?
… It can’t be helped. It’s her family’s problem. It’s strange as it is for her to adventure with commoners for so long.
But, but! This is really strange! Darkness actually left without saying anything! Our relationship isn’t so shallow that a farewell letter would be adequate!
That’s right. I think it’s because Kazuma has been going too far with his sexual harassment. I really don’t think you should throw our laundry into the tub and yell, ‘Yahoo~ Underwear bath!’.
I didn’t! I haven’t done that yet!
Did you say ‘yet’?
… Kazuma, you’re very concerned too, right? Be more honest with yourself! Make a trip to Darkness’s house!
We’ll be stonewalled again. She’s a grand noble after all. If we try to break in, we’ll be arrested. Darkness and her father won’t go so far as to execute us, but we can’t do anything if she doesn’t want to see us.
Kazuma, aren’t you thinking about doing something for Darkness? Developing new products like this; did you buy into the advice given by that useless devil? Devils are beings that merely operate on their twisted logic, you know? They won’t help others if there isn’t something in it for themselves.
I-I’m not concerned about that! I just don’t want to do more hard work and earn more money easily!
Tsundere? Hey Kazuma, are you a tsundere? You’re not being honest. Are you feeling lonely because Darkness isn’t here? I only acknowledge blonde twin tails to be tsunderes. If you understand, go dye and tie up your hair right now.
Even though these two are interacting as usual… It still feels like something’s missing…
… Hey Megumin, I’ll give you some spare change, so can you return to the mansion?
Don’t wanna. I’m a member of the party too, so I should have the right to decide on the new member.
It’s only been a few days and you’re already abandoning the comrade who’s been through thick and thin with us so easily? Kazuma’s inhuman. Inhuman.
No, that’s wrong. It’s Darkness’s wish for us to recruit a new member, right? I think it’d be best if Darkness returns. But she…
You’re just throwing a tantrum. Like Aqua said, you’re just shy, right? You don’t want to admit it and are putting on a strong front, huh? You just don’t want others to know that the reason you haven’t taken in any new members is because you can’t put Darkness out of your mind, right?
Kazuma, I advise you not to go in. If you do, you’ll learn the terror of the Crimson Demons.
Give it a shot if you can. If you do anything unnecessary, I’ll use your precious staff to clear the toilet.
Erm… Excuse me, I’m here because I saw this notice.
Ah, yes! Nice to meet you, I’m a warrior…
Wait, you don’t need to introduce yourself.
Before that, I want to test to see if you’re worthy enough to be in our party. After all, we’re a first class team that fights on par with the generals of the Demon King’s Army. The test consists of hunting a high bounty monster alone… Ouch!
There are no tests! Please ignore what she said!! Sorry, please wait a moment.
Eh, all right…
– Hey, come here. Come here right now.
I refuse… Ahhh, don’t pull on my collar, this cloak’s an important gift from my friend, you’re stretching it!
Don’t you understand? We can just be a party of five when Darkness comes back, right? I’m not tough enough to be a tank. Same with Aqua, even more so for you. Since Darkness isn’t here, we’ll need a tank to keep the monsters at bay.
I got it, I got it Kazuma. I understand the importance of the vanguard role. All right, let’s start the interview.
Listen up, it won’t be strange if we get targeted by the Demon King since we defeated a lot of generals. Vanir was dispatched here because Beldia was defeated in this town. To be safe, we need to at least ensure that we can fight at any time. If it’s really too much for you, we can let that guy join as a temporary member. Got it? Don’t mess things up, okay?
I got it. I won’t mess it up, I won’t.
Well… Sorry for the interruption. I’m Satou Kazuma. Just call me Kazuma. And this is…
I’m Megumin! The top mage in Axel and the one who wields Explosion magic! My nickname in this guild’s the Explosion girl with a screw loose! Come, let’s… Ouch!!
E-Erm… I heard the rumors, you’re that… S-Sorry, I thought the rumors were exaggerated at first, but… I won’t be able to keep up with your party, erm, please find someone else…
Kazuma, he doesn’t look good. I was just introducing myself and he got scared off. Next, let’s find the next one.
Hey Kazuma. What’s up, looking for party members? You should’ve given me a holler.
Don’t you already have a party? Where did they go?
Listen to this Kazuma. Those guys are really too much, saying they earned a tidy sum in the fight against Hydra and won’t be coming to work any time soon! I didn’t take the reward for subjugating the Hydra, so I have to earn my keep here. But most of the adventurers had money to spare, so I can’t even find a temporary party. Warrior types are a dime a dozen… Well, basically, if you are looking for a vanguard, why don’t you take me in?
Snipe! Snipe, Snipe, Snipe! … No good, my arrows aren’t dealing damage! These things are too tough!
Arrows and blades are meaningless against adaman snails! Kazuma, please hold them back with magic! I’ll protect the farmland from them before the loli’s spell is ready!
Hey, who’s this ‘loli’ you’re referring to? Why don’t you tell me?!
Hey! Joseph got stabbed right in the butt by a summer bamboo shoot! It’s a serious wound, so he won’t be able to do farm work anymore! Stretcher him out right now!
The wild boars are here! Wild boars and other pests are using the chaos as a chance to sneak in!
Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze!!
Bring it on!
Wahhh?
Kazuma! I finished chanting Explosion!
Do it! Megumin, blow them all away!
Hey…! Wait…!
Explosion!
So, Satou Kazuma-san, Megumin-san, and Dust-san will only get five thousand eris…
Hee, don’t mind it, shit happens. I earned enough money for beer today. Don’t let it get you down. After all, the monkeys would have escaped and the quest would’ve failed if not for the Explosion!
Erm, I think the three of us did great if we consider the fact that Aqua and Darkness weren’t around. And there were too few adventurers for this. They should’ve recruited more people.
… I did say something about forming a temporary party and telling you to visit my place to introduce you to Aqua, but what are you panicking about?
Kazuma, this is bad! Help me out! Please, can you come with me?
I don’t know the details, but I’ll be going out for now.
… Eh, hold up. Is that what it is? The bad news is that Lynn has found a man?
That’s right! This is a really huge matter, but Tyler and Keith just brushed me off with a ‘is that so?’
My important comrade is being intimate with some random guy! If a girl from your party hooked up with some strange guy, you’d worry too, right?
I kinda  get it.
Right? As expected of Kazuma, you really know me, man!
… H-Hey, you’re st…
Which means! A wild guy appeared out of nowhere and conned Lynn! I’m worried about my comrade. I want to investigate that guy’s background. Please Kazuma, the other two guys aren’t dependable! I’m begging you, help me out!
… I understand. It’s a little disgusting, but if I were in your shoes, I might’ve wanted to investigate that guy too. I don’t think Lynn will have any problems, but I adventured with her for a while, so I’m concerned about who that guy is too.
Whoa! You have a way with words, Kazuma! I’m counting on you!
This is the place, Kazuma. The scum conman’s right here.
And so, how are we going to do this? You’re not going to barge into that man’s room, right?
Just how long do you think I’ve been an adventurer for? You won’t live long if you don’t make through preparations in our line of work. I’ve already found out where he’s staying and rented the room next to it.
Okay, this is it… The walls are thin, so keep it down. Lynn should be in the room next door right now. She has good ears and might notice our voices.
Even if you say that… It’s hard for me to ask too…
C-calm down! Erm, have you thought it over? You’re a noble, so you shouldn’t be finding an adventurer as a partner. And the problem isn’t…
Lynn-san! I know very well that my feelings can’t be conveyed because of the difference in status! No, I also know about the bigger obstacle before me. But, at least…! I want to take some photos with the magic camera that I bought after breaking the bank!
C-C-Calm down! Please calm down! Just calm down, all right?
If possible! Right, make it lewder!
Calm down! I’m begging you, calm down! Let’s go downstairs and eat something to ease the mood, all right?
I’ll go beat him up right now.
Hey, wait, don’t leave! Now’s not the time!
Hey Kazuma, look at the clothes that are dumped around the place! As expected of a noble, this is all great stuff!
Okay, let’s see, what treasures does that young master have…? Eh, this is?
Look Kazuma, red lace lingerie! That bastard, he wants to take pictures of Lynn wearing this? That pervert even prepared this! I’ll use it like this!!
All right, Kazuma! Use that high quality magic camera to take my pictures! I want his expensive films to be filled with my naked pictures. Just in case he gets a picture of Lynn, this will at least scar him for life!
All right, do it Kazuma! Immortalize my beautiful body!
Well done Dust, that’s the way! You’re sparkling right now!! We’re done with glamorous poses, let’s move on to the lewd ones! First, bite your finger and point your ass this way!
Okay, now for a cooler feeling! Spread your legs, lower your waist and put your hands… Right, that’s the feeling!
Let’s get it on!
… So, what’s this all about? I know Dust’s a dumbass, but Kazuma too– What are you two doing?
I’m very sorry.
Sigh… Really, there was no point in me worrying so much. Ah, do what you want to him, I’ve nothing more to say… Kazuma, let’s go.
… Hmm? No, letting these two be alone together is bad. It might lead to trouble.
Whatever, I don’t want to care anymore.
Dust-san, I didn’t imagine that you would be in my room while wearing that…
Ah? So what if I committed breaking and entering, you got a problem with that?
Hey Lynn, shouldn’t we stop him? He’ll definitely do something, right?
I don’t know if he’ll be the one doing, or be the one receiving… I did my best. Yup, I tried. Even though I did try, that dumbass was right in the room wearing that when I opened the door. That’s like a duck holding some spring onions jumping into a pot and closing the lid. It’s too late for me to do anything now.
O-Of course I won’t mind, Dust-san! Dust-san…! Ahhh… Dust-san! Waahhhh, I’m so very grateful! Even though Lynn-san said that I should give up, but to think that… I was right to join the Axis Cult and devote myself in prayer…! T-There really is a goddess…!
I don’t know why you’re so happy, but if you think everyone’s afraid of the nobles, you’re wrong. I’m used to dealing with royalty and nobles. And it’s just two men here right now, things like status doesn’t matter. Do you get what I mean?
What? You mean you don’t care about our difference in status? And you said that it’s just two men in here…? Ahhh… Ahhh…! Today’s truly a great day, I’m immensely grateful to you, Aqua-sama…!
– Well then, what were the two of you doing in that place? Just what happened?
Eh, actually…
Ah, ahahaha…! T-that’s too stupid! There’s definitely something wrong with you two! Ahahaha!
Sigh… Listen to me, the one the noble likes is Dust.
… Eh?
And so, that noble came to discuss with me about what he should do as he had fallen for Dust. He mentioned that he didn’t harbor any hope of being together with Dust, but wanted to take some photos of him at the very least.
Hyaa!
By the way, that noble reminds me that Lalatina’s a noble too. I only found out recently, what a surprise.
You found out? From who?
The news’s all over the town now. Lalatina’s the daughter of house Dustiness and will be marrying Alderp, the landlord of this town soon.
Please tell me the details.
Thus, we’ll now hold the battle conference on how to break through the heavily guarded mansion and meet Darkness. However, I already have a basic plan in mind!
Kazuma’s really excited. So the marriage between Darkness and the landlord as fat as a pig’s the talk of the town now? I know Darkness has bad taste in men, but this is really atrocious. Normally, Darkness’s father would veto it. Did something happen…? I’m pissed as this is happening right now, as well as the divination of that suspicious devil coming true…
Kazuma, do you really believe in the divination of that devil? You’re really doing what the devil told you, developing merchandise nonstop despite your immense wealth… He’s not as bad as Aqua, but devils won’t help others if they don’t gain something from it. So he’ll definitely reap some benefit from it if he gives you any advice. If we can return to the Crimson Demon village, we can ask a great fortune teller onee-san that I know…
I don’t think Vanir said that for fun, even though he didn’t say it seriously. I don’t know how helping Darkness will benefit him… In fact, I’m only working hard on developing my products just in case it’ll be of use for Darkness as foretold by the divination. Even if the divination fails, there’s nothing bad about developing merchandise. My thoughts are that simple…
In any case, it’s still too early to come to a conclusion. We only heard the secondhand account that Lynn heard from someone else. We won’t know the situation unless we ask the person directly. The letter only told us that she wants to leave the party, so we don’t know much more than that. That landlord gave us plenty of problems too, so we need to forcibly meet with her to clear things up. Am I right?
Hey Kazuma, you looked really out of it recently, but seem really happy right now.
Yup, about time to go. Aqua, I’m counting on you.
Increase Strength and Improve Speed
Versatile Actor!
What was that spell just now?
A spell that turns you into a super actor.
I’ll go on ahead.
Take care of yourself. It’s fine if you knock her out and drag her back by force.
… N-No matter what, you’re still a woman of the cloth. Is it fine to say that?
No, Aqua’s right. She’s stubborn and won’t budge even if you tried to reason with her. It’s fine to be a little rough with her, don’t hold back!
Why are you all always so violent?
After I get onto the roof, untie the rope from the fence. There might be patrols, so they’ll know I’ve infiltrated if they find the ropes. I’ll think of a way to get out, so go back to the mansion and wait for now.
Tinder.
Freeze.
Did you really hear something?
Eh. I hope it was just my imagination…
See, it’s nothing. Norris, it’s about time you change your cowardly personality. Let’s go to the kitchen and ask for some supper to eat.
S-Sorry… I thought I heard something breaking…
… This is Norris here… Huh…?
T-This is really amazing… Ah~ Ah~ Darkness, oh, it’s Darkness…! This is without a doubt the voice of Darkness!
You’re wonderful Kazuma-sama, do me!
Sorry, this is Norris! I forgot to mention that the young lady wanted supper! I still have to do my rounds; may you please send the supper to the young lady’s quarters?
Really, why are you so eccentric, Chuck? You’re usually meticulous about things, but you always forget about the important stuff… Understood, we’ll send it over, work hard on your duties.
Thank you very much!
Young lady, I’m here to bring you supper.
Erm, Norris said that the young lady wanted supper…
…? I don’t remember saying that.
…? I-I’m very sorry for disturbing you so late at night!
Young lady, please wake up. A man named Satou Kazuma suddenly came here in the middle of the night saying he wants to meet the young lady no matter what…!
… Those claiming to be Kazuma, Aqua and Megumin are to be ignored– I already said that. Really, that guy actually came at such an hour… He really is–!
But young lady, that Kazuma man says if he’s ignored, he’ll spill the dark history of Lady Lalatina to the people in the guild…
Fufu, that guy’s the same as usual… Tell Kazuma to do as he wishes. Anyway, I can’t visit the adventurer’s guild any more…
But young lady, that man’s telling very unsavory things to the servants at the main gate. He said the young lady’s abs are getting more and more defined, and that the young lady’s very concerned. He asked us to control the amount of protein in her meals…
He also said that the young lady once giggled happily when she posed with a cute one-piece dress and that we should prepare more of such clothing…
T-These, these, these are… All lies! Lies! Don’t be fooled!
Eh, he mentioned something more incredible– May I repeat it to you?
… S-Say it.
He said the young lady accumulates lust within your mature body over time. Even though you’re a virgin, but every night–
!??????????
With Aqua’s support spells, I won’t lose so easily!
?
Hey, hey Darkness, don’t misunderstand! The situation’s weird now, but I don’t mean it that way. I just came to talk to you, so don’t think that this as a night raid… Ah, hey! Don’t close your eyes as if you’re resigned to your fate! Stop! The atmosphere will become weirder! Stop, this is bad, bad in all sorts of ways!
Hey, hey listen to me! I sneaked in here to ask you what happened! Look, don’t scream when I remove my hands, all right? I’m here to talk to you!
I’m letting go now. Don’t scream, all right?
Erm… Kazuma, can you lie beside me when we talk. If you ride on top of me and stick so close, it’s a bit…
Thief…! I’m about to be violated… Ugh…!
Is something the matter, young lady? Pardon me, I’m opening the door now!
Don’t open the door! My appearance’s indecent right now! Sorry, I was too excited with my intense game just now and yelled by accident!
Is that so…? However, this humble one has yet to confirm the young lady’s safety… And playing games in the middle of the night’s a little…
Intense game means the type of games that adults play alone, don’t make me say it, it’s embarrassing.
Young lady…?
What, you might be saying that you want to confirm my safety, but in actual fact, you just want to see my indecent appearance, right? You pervert, ahhh!
What, what’s the matter?
N-Nothing! I just forgot to turn the indecent magic toy off, ahhh! Ahhh, it, it’s breaking! I’m turning strange! I can’t hold it in anymore! I’m really going to break!
P-Pardon me! I-I’ll leave at once!!
… Seriously, you actually went that far? The servants are going to address me as the perverted young lady in secret now… Ughh…!
You must be thinking ‘that isn’t too bad’.
No I didn’t.
Yes you did.
Hey, what in the world happened? Why’d you leave the party, the rest are worried about you too. At least explain the situation, we’re…
Some things can’t be said because all of you are my important companions… Well, it’s nothing serious, just some problems in my home. Actually, my house owes money to that landlord and father said he’ll pay it back by instalments… But my father’s health’s ailing recently, so that landlord came to rush for the payment, questioning if my father can repay the debt within his lifetime and making things difficult… I heard that the debt would be forgiven if I marry him. It’s that simple.
Your house owes that much money? Isn’t your dad a grand noble in this nation, wouldn’t the king help him out? And this…
That’s right, it’s coercion through loaning us money… However, this is the norm for nobles. A daughter from a noble family marrying another noble– that’s all it is.
Don’t make such an expression, Kazuma. You know my taste in men, right? That landlord seemed really eager to make me his. That lusty pig-like landlord won’t even wait for the wedding night before rushing into my room and pushing me down. Hehe, he’ll probably ravage me for days without anything to eat or drink, how exhilarating…!
That’s why you wanted to defeat the Hydra with just the few of us… Erm, sorry for getting so many people to join in, the path to hell is paved with good intentions… How much did you owe, I’ll pay for it–
Don’t put it that way, Kazuma. I’m a noble. My duty is to protect the people. Rather than using the hard earned money of the citizens to pay my debt, I’d rather sell my body… And your assets won’t be enough to clear the debt.
… Instead of giving my precious virginity to the landlord… Hey Kazuma, how about becoming adults together…?
… Your abs are getting really defined.
I was in the wrong! I admit I was in the wrong, okay? It was a slip of the tongue! Sorry, I couldn’t help it!
There are times when I blow my top too! Damn it, how dare you toy with a woman who’s offering her body, you’ll pay for this! I’ll cut you into pieces!
Young lady, please don’t use crude terms like ‘cut you into pieces’! …What, so you like me, is that it? Then just say it straight!
Who’d like a dumbass like you? I’m seriously pissed off right now! And don’t call me young lady!
Hehe, what now Kazuma? My servants are here! You’re done for if they find you. You broke into the bedroom of a young lady; you’ll lose your head without my help! If you prostrate yourself before me now, I might just forgive you!
Young lady! We’re opening the door now, young lady!
Bring it on! Lewdsader whose only strong points are your erotic body, stamina and arm strength! It’s time to see you cry a river after losing to the weakest job! Have a taste of the real power I showed in the capital!
D-Don’t mimic my voice!
Y-Young lady? What are you playing at?
Don’t open the door~ Lalatina’s naked right now! I’ll be seen~!
Huh? P-Pardon me…!
Don’t say that with my voice! Hey, come in quick! It’s an intruder who can mimic my voice with magic!
Ah, okay, right away!
Hahaha! It’s my win, Kazuma! After so many battles with you, I’m satisfied that we can finally resolve this!
Freeze!!
Ahhh!
Young lady!
Create Earth!
Everyone, cover your…!
Wind Breath!
Have you found him yet? He’s not in the shadows here! That guy has the Lurk skill, don’t overlook places that seem empty either! Don’t let him escape! With the name of house Dustiness on the line, I want that fellow captured and brought before me!
Yes, young lady!
Kazuma! Where are you? If you come out now, I’ll forgive you after punching you at full force ten times! But if you get caught by me, I won’t let you off so simply!
… Is someone there…?
Ah, it’s you… What are you doing here in the middle of the night…? I see, my daughter has a bunch of good comrades…
Old man, sorry for visiting you when you’re not feeling well, but your daughter’s raging in the house right now. Could you calm her down?
Is that so. My daughter that was so depressed recently actually got that angry?
Old man, I heard you owe that landlord some money, but I don’t think someone like you’d borrow from him. Also, this doesn’t look like a house that’s troubled over money. Why are you troubled over debts then…?
… Yes, Kazuma-kun, you really are bright. I’ll leave my daughter to you. Sorry, but can you elope with her…?
No, I refuse, no freaking way. Also, your daughter’s chasing me all over the house and yelling for my blood right now. If you’ll allow me to be frank, your daughter’s really refined.
Haha, you’re right, she’s a virtuous and gentle girl. Pure, shy and hates to trouble others.
Please don’t mind the details. My daughter only owes money because of her own actions… Don’t worry, once you elope with my daughter, I can sell the house. I’ll get a large sum then. I’m thinking of some other way to wipe away the debt too.
However, my daughter wanted to settle the problem through marriage. I’m willing to give anything to stop her… Kazuma-kun. As a father, I can tell that my daughter really likes you. I might be shamelessly promoting her but– She’s really a good woman… How about it, would you take her hand…?
You ask me how about it…? Your daughter just said she wanted to turn me into mincemeat…
That’s right, old man, just where does it hurt? I’ve a good… Eh, an Archpriest that’s only good with magic in my team. She can even use Resurrection. I don’t know where it hurts for you, but if I bring her here, there should be a way to help.
… No, it’s futile. Healing magic can’t heal me either. And Resurrection won’t work if I die from sickness. That’d be considered a natural death. Those who die a natural death can’t be woken by the miracle of the gods. No matter the cause of death, those whose time has come should return to the heavens. This is something we should be happy for… So, don’t make such a sad face.
Can you let the Archpriest in my party diagnose your illness? For uncle to fall sick at such a time is a bit…
Like I’ve been poisoned by the landlord, right?
I already investigated. No, this is the first possibility I checked. I wasn’t poisoned.
Have you still not found him? Come out, Kazuma! And explain to the house help how you mimicked my voice, and clear up the misunderstanding!
Hey… I leave my daughter to you.
Can’t you discuss this with the king or someone about this? Uncle’s a grand noble in this kingdom, right? If the debts were forced onto you by the landlord through unscrupulous means…
Even if I did so, my daughter will still marry. She’s really stubborn, I wonder who she learned that from. Even if I asked the king for help, she’d say, ‘Don’t use the tax money of the people on something like this’ and sacrifice herself… Sigh, why’s my daughter so witless.
Hehe… So you’re here, Kazuma, hahaha! Let’s see how you’ll…
Hey, there’s a sick person here, don’t make a din opening the door. Calm down, I only came as a representative for everyone who’s worried about you…!
Shut up! To think you can shatter the reputation of the target you’re worried about in such a short time…! This is a matter between nobles, a commoner like you shouldn’t interfere! Go back to the mansion and farm some strange crops should be enough for you!
Forget about the debt! Let’s run away together and start over in a new place! You should know that if I return empty handed, those two will–! Especially Megumin, she’ll do something reckless! Like blowing away the venue of your wedding or something!
Do it if you’ve got the guts! I’ll definitely have you arrested as the mastermind! If you don’t want to go to jail, rein them in! I won’t run! Even if I do, someone else will be implicated! … And first of all…
You, witless stubborn woman! Enough, do what you want! I won’t care no matter how much you cry after this!
If you want my help, you can apologize to me anytime! Say, ‘I’m sorry for making everyone worry, I need Kazuma-sama’s help’… Uwah!
A-Are you all right, Kazuma-sama? If you say, ‘Sorry Darkness-sama, please save me!’, I won’t mind giving you first aid!
D-Damn it… Darkness! I won’t help you even if you come to me crying! – Don’t fucking come here! Create Water! Freeze!
Uguuu…! Aqua! Aqua!! Heal me! Heal me quick!!
… Hmm? … Hey, what happened to you Kazuma, you’re wounded all over! Did you see Darkness? Why are you hurt so badly? Did you say something dumb again?
Kazuma, you’re finally back. What happened? Did you shoot your mouth off again? Did you convince Darkness?
Don’t get involved with that girl anymore! Leave her be! Unless she comes crying for help, leave her alone! I don’t want to suffer anymore, so take care of the rest!
Eh… Darkness even promised to build a small pet house after this kid hatches…
Kazuma, I don’t know what happened, but now’s not the time to throw tantrums! And why must Darkness marry anyway?
She owes money! Her family owes a big sum of money to the landlord! I heard the debt will be forgiven if she marries the landlord!
Ugh… Debt, huh? I don’t know how much she borrowed, but I just sent money back home and don’t have much on me…
It can’t be helped. If she really needs money, I’ll break my tiger-shaped piggy bank then.
She already made up her mind! Just let her be! Unless she comes to me crying and apologizing, I won’t do anything about it!
Kazuma, is this the time to vent your anger? Darkness’s going to be married off! Are you fine with that?
Kazuma. I’ve already asked plenty of times, but is this okay? Is this really okay? Is this really, really, okay?
I’ve already said it many times; I can’t do anything if she’s so stubborn about it. There’s still a week left, if she comes to me crying, I’ll think of something. If not, I won’t worry about it.
Stop fooling around! You should think about it more seriously! I won’t acknowledge this! If you’re just going to sit idly by, I’ve my own plans too!
Hey, don’t cause any trouble, okay? If you go too far with your stupid plans, it’ll trouble Darkness. Darkness asked me to rein you and Aqua in… All right, give that back. I’ve spent a lot of time since this morning to make it.
… What’s this?
I’m creating something known as bubble wrap from my country. It feels different because of the material and the way it’s made; I still think it’s workable.
… What’s it used for?
It’s meant to be popped. By popping it one at a time, your heart will become peaceful.
… That’s it?
That’s it.
Ahhh–!!
What the hell–?
… This does help one to calm down. I feel a little better.
That’s the way the money goes. Pop, goes the weasel–
Shut up!
Excuse me, is there a Satou Kazuma-sama here?
Who is it? … Wait, I’ve met you before.
It’s been a while, I’m the head butler of house Dustiness, Hagen. I’ve something to discuss with Kazuma-sama today…
Actually, we’ve been receiving mail like this every day.
I’m very sorry! I’ll teach that dumb broad a lesson!
No, it’s fine. It’s just that it’d be bad if such letters are sent to the house of the landlord, that’s why I’m here before it escalates that far.
A notice to the Dustiness house. According to reliable sources, a General of the Demon King’s Army might perform a terrorist attack on the Church of Eris in Axel. The day of the attack’s the day of the ceremony. If you don’t stop the wedding, the Church will be blown away by explosion magic. Please take this warning seriously… From a certain earnest mage.
Megumin! I’ve got something to tell you, open the door!
All right, next! A rookie killer bigger than the bag itself will come out of it!
Are you trying to die by releasing that thing? What the hell are you doing, get over here!
Hey, what are you doing Kazuma, let go! I even submitted a request to capture a rookie killer just for this, okay? That aside, look at all these people!! All of them are here to watch my performance.
That’s why they asked me to come here, don’t cause trouble by doing this in front of other people’s homes! Stop it! Why are you even doing this?
Ah, please don’t tip me, I’m not a busker, I don’t take donations… Kazuma, this is a plan to lure Darkness out of the mansion.
You’re performing here in order to attract Darkness’s attention?
That’s it! Think about it, don’t you know about the story of the sun goddess’s cave? A certain goddess threw a tantrum and became a hikikomori, but she was lured by the singing and dancing of a party, got tricked and dragged out.
I heard about that before, but do all the gods in this world like parties? Not all goddesses are like you.
I noticed that the curtain in that room has been shaking from just now. It must be the curious Darkness who’s peeking. Hey~! Darkness, can you hear me? Come on out~! Quick, you’ll regret it if you don’t come and see! You can get to see my secret technique now! … Ah, hey Kazuma, what are you doing, unhand me!
Like I said, they came to me to complain, so stop performing in front of their house! All right, time to go!
Don’t wanna! If Darkness doesn’t come out, I’ll perform here every day!! Go away if you’re here to hinder me! Go on, shoo!!
I’m home…
Welcome back. Don’t do anything stupid again.
Thanks to the people from Darkness’s house, I was given an exceptional pardon…
You wanted to help Darkness, but were saved by her instead. I know how you feel, but don’t be reckless now. Both you and Aqua are doing nothing but trouble, you know?
As expected, Aqua and I couldn’t achieve much. Kazuma, it’s about time you helped us interfere with the wedding, right?
… I’ll go if Darkness asks for my help.
You inhumane bastard! You’re known as Scumzuma and Trashzuma in town, but I still thought that you were someone who wouldn’t leave your friends in a ditch and would help when it was time to do so!
Hey, could you tell me the names of the ones calling me by those names? It’s about time I settle things with them.
At a time like this, the person I like would say, ‘It can’t be helped’ in an irritated tone and would come up with a plan. That’s the kind of man he is. He shouldn’t be someone who keeps throwing tantrums.
D-Don’t think I’ll help you just because you hinted that you like me, okay? I won’t be fooled so easily.
Don’t be so mad, give this a try. This thing here’s a punching bag, used to vent one’s stress. It’s made with real leather, you know? Well, the only material that can be used is real leather though.
How do you use this?
Simple. Just attack it. Punching or kicking will work. Ah, let me be clear, spells are prohibited. That’s common sense, but I should tell you just in case.
Take this!!
?
Hee… I feel a little bit battled. Excuse me, please make another one.
Why’d you use a knife? Didn’t I tell you to punch or kick it?
Let’s go Kazuma! We’ll destroy the ceremony! … Hehe, a spell accidentally flies over and blows up the church, or a spell accidentally making the landlord’s mansion explode, such things are quite common.
Hey, don’t do that. Forget the debts, you really will become a criminal.
The person I like isn’t someone who’d keep wallowing in depression! Kazuma! Are you fine with Darkness marrying the landlord? Are you fine with the landlord doing whatever he wants with Darkness?
It! Isn’t! Fine!
It isn’t fine; I don’t like that guy getting Darkness either! He’s ugly and has a bad reputation! You should know that! That old man got his hands on cute girls and good women through unscrupulous means, then chased them away with a token breakup fee after he had enough! Worst of all, despite his insidious behavior, the decisive evidence is always missing for some reason!
Sorry. So you investigated the person Darkness’s going to wed…?
That means we can’t just ignore this, right? Kazuma, can’t you think of any underhanded plan? Like you did for the hapless party before, think of something.
But I can’t do anything this time. First of all, Darkness didn’t tell me how much she owes, so I’ve no idea about that at all. Next, even if I raised the money, I can’t convince Darkness. That stubborn girl won’t be willing to accept the money. And finally…
Finally?
This is a wedding ceremony between nobles. The security’s tight, so we can’t go near it… Or rather, that’s the reason why I’ve been waiting for Darkness to ask for my help. As for Darkness’s house, they strengthened their security after I broke in last time, so I can’t get in again.
Darkness’s father fell sick, so we’ll be rejected even if we seek an audience with him… I don’t have any ties with nobles that’d allow for me to enter the venue where the ceremony will take place… I’m just a commoner after all.
I understand. I know that Kazuma investigated the groom and did what you could. That’s enough for me.
I’ll seriously think about it and take a path I won’t regret. Kazuma, please think it through carefully too and take a path you won’t regret…
Thank thee for thy patronage! Forget about the unreliable goddess, the devil who can see through everything’s here to help thou. Weep tears of joy for moi visit and cheer as much as thee wish. Come, let moi see the various knowledge possessed by thou!
Hey, bring the beautiful shop owner over here! Change, change! Why must I discuss business with you when I am feeling down? I want the beautiful shop owner! Wiz! Give me Wiz!
Right now, she is busy tending the shop while crying, saying that she ‘wants to sleep longer’. Unexpectedly this had the effect of ‘the owner who is crying as she works is so cute’ and ‘She will cry tears of joy if the merchandise sells well! Buy buy buy!’, which made moi extremely happy. Also, it is impossible for that debt creation machine to negotiate business with others. Yesterday, moi was feeling charitable and gave her a short break, but I only took moi eyes off her for a moment and she brought in these pendants, saying that she wants to sell them to adventurer couples.
What kind of pendants?
These are pendants that will explode by burning the last shred of the person’s life who is on the verge of dying. The underlying principle is ‘sacrificing your life to protect the ones you most cherish at the final moment…’ Isn’t that romantic, she kept excitedly going ‘hyaa’, ‘hyaa’. However, this thing is too powerful, not just the enemy, even the person you are protecting will be blown away. It really makes moi doubt the owner’s business sense. Thou want one?
… I-I will pass… That aside, what do you mean about helping me?
Leave that aside for now. Bring out the goods first. Moi will use my eyes to see through the appropriate price… However, moi have already prepared the money that will satisfy thee.
That might be so, but I might still haggle with you. This is the compilation of all the knowledge I have. It should be obvious that I have no intention of selling it for cheap.
The man who wants to rescue the armour girl very much but is afraid of being rejected. The devil Vanir who can see through everything announce this here. Thou will relinquish all thy intellectual property rights in exchange for what is inside this bag.
Hey Vanir, you know everything right?
Hmm. Not everything, but moi can see through most of it. For example, moi knows what thou art going to ask next. Why did the armour girl you care so much about owed a huge debt to the landlord. Is there any way to save her. Why isn’t there any evidence despite all the landlord’s wrongdoings.
… Hey, even though you are a devil…
Even though moi art a devil, why art moi aiding you without anything to gain? Is moi plotting something… Of course there is. Moi art a devil after all. For example, in order to buy the valuable intellectual property thou art keeping on hand for emergencies at a bargain…
You can’t do anything if I don’t sell it. Instead of that, if you know something that I want, then just tell me.
All right all right. Well then, moi will reveal the truth to thee! For example, what type and colour the shop owner is wearing today! Hahaha, just kidding… Hmm? The delicious negative emotions didn’t flow out.
Please tell me about that later.
O-Okay… Well then, I will tell thou the things thee really want to know. The armour girl is in debt because…
Sacred Exorcism!
Hey Vanir! You’re an arch devil right? It is fine, you won’t die because of an attack from the goddess of toilets right? Wake up!
What? I take my eyes off you for just a moment and Kazuma gets brainwashed by a devil? Hey, why are you helping the devil? And I am the goddess of water!
Hahaha, thou actually use sneak attacks just like a devil, delinquent goddess! Look, moi cool mask is cracked!
Com now~ Devils are like pests, aren’t they~? Will you give pests a heads up before exterminating them, and say ‘I am going to kill you, so I’m very sorry’? Isn’t that dumb? Don’t make me laugh.
Hey you two, pick another day to fight. Aqua, I want to hear what Vanir has to say, don’t get in the way!
E-Erm, I don’t know what the fuss is about. Archpriest-sama, the ceremony will begin at noon, we’ll be in your care. Well then, I’ll excuse myself.
Hahaha, useless goddess who wasn’t of any help for this incident, bite vexingly at thy handkerchief as thee watch the grace and utility of moi!
It is hard to talk like this… The sad man who can’t even depend on her even though a goddess is by his side. Thou want to know why the armour girl is in debt? It all began with the subjugation of the Mobile Fortress Destroyer.
Hey, explain.
There isn’t much details to speak of. Like other cities in the past, the landlord will lose their territory after the Destroyer rampaged through it. The citizens will lose their homes and the nobles will bear the responsibility, everyone will be uprooted from their lives. This might be a relatively better ending for the wandering adventurers. However, this city wasn’t ravaged.
The town was saved. The people whose livelihood is in the town was spared. It’s the same for the citizens, too… And the Destroyer was defeated at the city gates. Of course, that means the flood control facilities, granaries and all sorts of structures were destroyed along the way.
Because the granaries are destroyed, the crop workers lost their jobs and fortune. It wasn’t easy to rebuild the granaries. And so, these people sought help from the landlord.
That’s right, it is just as thou think! That landlord said to the people seeking his help: ‘Just making out with your life is already a blessing, don’t ask for more. If you want to complain, complain to the adventurers who failed to protect the granaries. Look, the adventurers received a huge reward and have money to spare. Why not make them compensate with their bounty?’
The people who were rejected by the landlord went crying towards someone. That’s right, they went to seek house Dustiness, who has close ties with all of thee. They said ‘The merciful Dustiness-sama who shouldered the cost of the flood damages for a mere adventurer. Please take pity on us too’… That’s how it is.
What did you say? What happened to the buildings damaged by the flood?
Aside from the mansion, most of the wealth of house Dustiness was used to pay for the damages. After losing most of their assets, the armour girl from house Dustiness lowered her head to the landlord to take out a loan in order to help the people who are suffering because of the Destroyer.
The landlord who was reluctant to lend his money added the following condition, ‘if something happens to the head of the house Dustiness which makes it hard to return the loan, then use your body as collateral.’
… Hey Kazuma, banging the table in a fit of rage hurts right? It hurts right?
How much is Darkness’ debt?
Thy entire fortune together with the contents of this bag, will be enough to pay off the debt… Well then, let’s talk business!
You’re really…! You’re really beautiful, young lady…! After the ceremony, we must let old master who’s recuperating in bed to see your glamourous appearance!
Why are you stopping me from seeing the bride? Hey, get out of my way! I can’t wait any longer! Lalatina will be mine in a few hours, it’s just a matter of time! Scram! … Lalatina! Lalatina!!
No. This is the waiting room of house Dustiness. Since the ceremony has yet to begin, only those from house Dustiness can pass through this place. Please turn back.
You fool! Listen well, I’ll be your master after the ceremony ends. You should think carefully if you should stop me!
You shall not pass. You’re not currently my boss..
… I’ll remember you. After the ceremony ends and I’ve my way with your precious young lady, you’ll get it from me.
… Please ask that person outside the door to come here, I want to thank him.
Young lady, you’re really beautiful…!
I’m sorry… It’s fine to let him in, all right? I don’t mind anymore. I’ll talk to him so he won’t punish you.
I plan to resign after the young lady marries, so don’t worry. After all, the only one I’ll serve is the Dustiness house. But if it’s a man the young lady acknowledges, I’ll be willing to serve him too.
Young lady, the smile you show from time to time is beautiful. I feel blessed to see that expression at the very end.
… E-Erm, this might not be my business, but the young lady’s really beautiful and elegant after all… Please don’t go too far when you play by yourself…
?
E-Erm… Young lady?
Oh, sorry, it’s nothing.
Young lady, how beautiful…! Please come before the mirror…!
It’s time. Let us be off, young lady. The priest who’ll be gifting this wonderful day with her blessings is the best in this town. This will definitely be a joyous wedding…
Do you, Darkness, take this old man who’s so fat that he’s sweating oil, to be your wedded husband, in defiance of my wish as a goddess? Do you promise to love this old man, comfort this old man, honor and keep this old man in sickness and in health, safekeeping your virginity from this old man as long as you both shall live? You can’t do it, right? Well then, I want to go home together with Darkness and eat the dishes made by Kazuma and drink all I want…
…? What? Y-You’re the woman who gave me a ton of trouble in my house! What are you doing? Why are you here?
W-What have all of you done…? Aqua… K-Kazuma! K-Kazuma, let go of me! Just what are you two planning to do? This is no joking matter! Barging into the wedding ceremony between nobles will end in nothing short of execution! What foolish thing have you done? Why are you so foolish?!
Shut up idiot! You’re the one who’s stubbornly doing stupid things, don’t just decide to cover my debts on your own! Do you think you’re my wife? If you like me, just tell me straight– I’ve already told you that!
When did you ever say that? What are you talking about, you buffoon?
T-Take this man! Arrest him and the phony priest! He… He’s just a commoner and he dares disrupt the wedding of nobles! Hurry, hurry up and seize him!
Damn you! This has nothing to do with you, get lost! You might like Lalatina, but–! She owes me an enormous debt that you won’t be able to pay in your entire lifetime! If you like this woman so much, then prepare the money to buy that woman first, plebeian! That is if you can even do that!!
I heard you loud and clear, so make good on your promise, old man! Take this, the debt Darkness owed you, two billion eris! Two thousand pieces of magic silver eris coins worth a million eris each! I wiped away the debt, so I’ll be taking the girl! Also, I don’t like her that way! S-She’s just an important comrade!
Ahhh? What, two billion? Ah, wait, my Lalatina! Give Lalatina back… Ahhh, money! Pick them up! Hey, pick them up for me!
W-Why you!? Who asked for you to do that? You’re making a mockery of my resolve! And the money! Where did it come from?
I sold them. I sold all the ideas I could think of. Together with my savings from doing quests, it comes to exactly two billion eris. I’ve no choice but to earn an honest living from now on… It can’t be helped, I sold them all. I can’t buy them back even if I want to. If you understand, then let’s go!
To go so far, you… You’re really…! I-I…!!
Stop wasting time and get it together, you don’t have the right to reject this anymore! Stop arguing! I’ve already bought you from that old man landlord! You’re mine now! Listen well, I’ll be working you like a horse! Steel yourself to pay back my hard earned money with your body, you perverted Crusader!! Understand? Answer me if you get it!!
Y-Yes…
Hah… Hah… I-I’m sold… A noble like me, sold to this man! To think, that, that I’ve to pay back with my body…! Ahhh, what’s with this situation…? Abducted from the scene in a princess carry…! This is… This is…!
Hey, hey you-your drool! You’re drooling! Are you really okay?
As expected of the mean spirited Kazuma-san! You’re just paying back the debt that was shouldered for you, but you twist it into you buying Darkness! Hey Kazuma, if Megumin hears what you said about getting Darkness to pay back with her body, you’ll eat an Explosion, you know? If your body’s gone, I can’t revive you. So watch yourself, okay?
No, that’s not it! Don’t make it sound so bad, I was just going with the flow! I’ll just make her pay me back as a Crusader and an adventurer!
Damn it! Hey Darkness, how long are you going to stay like this? It’s time for you to run by yourself! And you’ve a lot of heavy muscles!!
Why, why you! It’s a rare moment, so why did you say such things and spoil the mood?
We’ve already went this far, there’s no other way! I’m fine with it! Get out of my way, dogs of the landlord! I’ll kill anyone in my path!!
Hey, we came here to save you, so why the hell are you charging to the front? Aqua, please buff me! Buff!
Leave it to me! You want the super entertainer spell?
Of course! That’s super useful!
Hey, don’t bother with them! Just let them go for now! All of you come help me pick up the money!!
Ah? Oh! Yes, Sir!!
Morons! Why are you all here? Go and capture Lalatina!
?
Light of Saber!
Megumin, I did it! Because we are bosom friends! I-If it’s my bosom friend’s request, I’ve no problem with doing something that seems to be a crime! After all, I was told: ‘Please help me, my bosom friend!’, so I can’t refuse!
Yes, yes, yes, thank you for your hard work, Yunyun. As expected of my bosom friend. Well then, you can go back to the inn now.
Eh?
The evil mage is here. Following her instincts, the evil mage is here to kidnap the bride.
Do you know what they call me? If so, then you must know what the magic at the tip of this staff is, right? Let me make this clear, controlling this spell requires a lot of concentration… If you sneak up on me and I lose control, it’ll go boom! Think about that if you want to rush me.
… Hmm? Megumin, Kazuma-san has already… Look…
W-What? What are all of you afraid of? You bunch of imbeciles! She must be making an empty threat! That idiot definitely knows the consequences of releasing explosion magic here! She won’t cast her spell, so get them!
Ho! You think I’ll be scared? You dare say I’ll be too scared to cast Explosion, are you for real? Very well then! I accept this challenge!
Stop! We won’t approach! We won’t, so please stop!
We won’t attack, so don’t do it!
Alderp-sama! Please don’t provoke her!
I wanted to show off my cool side and you two stole the best part from me! But I’m grateful that you came. Thanks!
Elegantly taking the best part is a Crimson Demon’s instinct. Really Kazuma, I knew you’ll do something even though you said you won’t… To think that you made your move before I did.
Megumin! Even Yunyun went so far…! After we go back… I’ve something to say to all of you. After we go back…! I’ll say my thanks…!
Don’t mention it, well… We’re comrades… H-How can I let such an excellent Crusader go?
Comrades… How nice to have comrades, Megumin! Erm, as a bosom friend, will you also rescue me if I fall into the same situation?
No, Yunyun’s just a bosom friend and even proclaims to be my rival… You’re not a comrade, so no…
?
Really, now’s not the time for a casual chat! Give us a plan!
Hey, that group watching over there. Don’t look around, I’m talking you bunch of adventurers! Over there are a bunch of criminals! Get my bride back from them! I’ll give you a grand reward in return! Or I can hire you to be my guards! You’ll then be free from the tedious job of adventuring! Please! My Lalatina! Bring my Lalatina back!
…? Hey, didn’t you hear me? I’ll pay you! How much do you want?
Hey Darkness. Just like the other time you challenged the Hydra alone, lots of people are helping you this round too. It’s time you reflect on your stubborn temper, you know?
… Ugh! Kazuma, I’m at my limit in controlling my spell! Can I fire it off? We’re already criminals anyway! I can’t wait any longer, may I shoot it at those guys?
Ughh, I can’t do it anymore, it’s gonna blow! Run, get away from me!
Explosion!
Quick, use this chance…
Hey Kazuma, to think that you can do something as shameless as hiding behind the person you’re rescuing.
… Yeah, Kazuma seemed really cool today, I was just wondering if there was something wrong with my eyes. I’m glad it was just my imagination.
K-Kazuma-san… You’re the worst…
The explosion magic can only be used once per day! Now’s our chance, get them!
Yunyun! I’ll leave this place to you, we’ll make a move first! No matter what happens to me, you mustn’t turn back! Fight on!
Idiot! We’re already bosom friends! What are you talking about, how can I ditch Megumin and…? What did you just say? Didn’t something like this happen in the Crimson Demon Village too?
Please stall for time, my bosom friend! I’ll introduce my friends to you next time!
I understand, leave this to me! We’re bosom friends after all, it can’t be helped!
She’s just a Crimson Demon girl! Get her before she completes her spell!
That huuuurts! Why’d you push me suddenly? Ahhh, my bones! My bones!! Dust, save me!
Hey Keith, are you okay? How terrible… It’s a comminuted fracture!
What? I just bumped into you, don’t try to pull a fast one! He was the one who dashed out all of a sudden and fell by himself! Hey, why are you grabbing my legs?! Didn’t you have a fracture? Unhand me!
Hey, hey! Are you trying to run after paralyzing him from the waist down? I don’t care if your boss’s the landlord or whatever, that’s too unreasonable!
You just said it was a comminuted fracture, and now he’s paralyzed? What the hell, don’t bother me! Scram! I’ll let you have it if you get in my way…!
That hurts! I’m an upstanding citizen and he used violence on me! He hit me! All right, the brawl’s on! Let’s go! I was abused by a certain noble recently too! I already hate nobles; I’ll vent it out on you then!
Hey? Wait, don’t?
The fight’s on!
Fight, fight!
Hey, I’m joining in too!
That landlord pissed me off since a long time ago!
Wait! D-Didn’t you’ve a fracture? You said you’ve a fracture! Wahhh!
Lalatina! Don’t go, Lalatina! Lalatina!
– Y-Young lady? Your dress…! H-Hurry, come in!
Dear father, pardon my intrusion.
… Oh, Lalatina… How beautiful… Just like your mother…
… Erm, I’m very sorry, dear father… I decided on the wedding on my own… But I destroyed it in the worst possible way and ran away…
Is that so…? That’s good. Don’t worry about it, there’s nothing to apologize for.
Kazuma-kun, could you please come over here.
… I’ll go get some fresh air outside.
… You did great this time. Thank you, you have my deepest gratitude.
I merely cleared the debt I owed your daughter.
Kazuma-kun, I’ll leave my daughter to you. Please.
Eh?
There’s no need. Is this a punishment game?
Eh?
Lalatina. Are you living happily now? So happy that you don’t mind throwing everything else away?
I am. I want to give up everything to protect my comrades.
Lalatina. Choose the path you wish to take. Leave everything else to me. Even with my body like this, I can still do something at the very end.
My beloved father, thank you for raising me…! When your health gets better, please chat with me and tell me about my late mother until I fall asleep…
I love you, my cute daughter. Yes, next time, I’ll tell you about how I met your mother…
Sacred Break Spell!
Ahhh?
D-Dear father?
It’s a curse! This must be a curse from a powerful devil, but I undid it easily!
But it’s fine now! That’s great, Darkness! You can chat with your father about your late mother as many times as you want!
Ahhh… Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!!
Yee– Yee– Yee–
It’s all because of you! If you were a more reliable devil, my Lalatina wouldn’t have been snatched away right there! Is your power to manipulate events so limited? Trash! Trash! You trash!
Yee– Yee– Yee– My devil powers will be weakened in a church. More importantly, someone seems to have broken the curse, Alderp.
The curse is broken? You piece of- Can’t you even curse a mere human to death?!
Max! Change the memories of everyone who attended the ceremony, as well as those who heard what I said to my advantage, and settle everything by tomorrow morning! Understand?
Yee– Yee– … Can’t do it, Alderp. I’m not that powerful.
… Can’t do it? I’m aware of the fact that you’re a low ranked devil. After all, you were randomly summoned by that divine relic … However, you don’t have the right to reject me. Do it! I don’t know what you can or cannot do, just get it done! Are there too many people? Isn’t memory manipulation your strongest suit? Do it now!
Can’t do it. There’s a light… Yee– The strong light that dismissed the spell is in my way, I really can’t do it.
Enough, useless devil! I’ll undo the contract with you and summon a more powerful devil! This is my last order! Bring Lalatina to me…! Use your power to manipulate events and bring Lalatina over right now! I’ll then pay all of the outstanding price!
Price? You want to pay the price?
It’s true. I’m serious. You’re too stupid, that’s why you forgot that I’ve paid the price multiple times already. I’ll properly  pay it this time. Go, bring Lalatina to me.
Is the lord of the territory here? It’s me. I’m here to apologize for what happened today, may you grant me an audience…?
Lalatina! Is that Lalatina? All right, great job Max! Splendid! You did amazingly! I don’t know how you did it, but I’ll fulfill my promise and pay the price! The contract’s undone! You’re free! Oh Lalatina, I’m opening the door now!
I didn’t do anything. Yee–! Yee–! You want to pay the price? Undo the contract?
I’m very sorry my lord… I’ll apologize for what happened earlier in the day… Please allow me to offer my body in exchange for the lives of my comrades…!
Hahaha! You think it’s Lalatina? Too bad, it’s moi! Oh, what intense dark emotions! How delicious, delicious! Hahaha!
? W-Who are you? Who the hell are you? This chilly feeling… It’s just like Max! Devil! You must be a devil!
Max! Kill this despicable devil right now!
…? Why must I kill my kin? Yee…? Hmm? Have I met you before?
This is the hundredth or thousandth time moi have introduced myself to thee. It’s the same this time– How do you do, Maxwell. Maxwell, manipulator of facts. Maxwell, twister of truth. Moi art the devil that can see through everything, Vanir. Devil that twists the truth, Maxwell, moi have come to receive thee!
Vanir! Vanir! Why, why’s your name so nostalgic? Have we met before?
W-Wait, hold up! He’s my servant! Don’t decide on your own and take him away!
Also, before moi appeared, you said this to Maxwell… ‘I’ll fulfill my promise and pay the price! The contract’s undone! You’re free!’
Yes, the contract between thou and Maxwell’s the problem. Ah, thou really made moi go round in circles.
S-S-So you… You, could it be?
Yes, just as you imagined! Moi created the opportunity for that brat to pay off the debt and told him about thee! Hahaha! This, this is great! What magnificent negative emotions! Delicious, delicious indeed!
You dare! You dare do such a thing…? If you just wanted this broken devil, you should’ve just told me up front! If you would’ve revealed your identity, I would’ve given him to you from the very start! You don’t need to involve the entire city and make me lose face before everyone…!
How interesting! Hahaha, what a good show, a good show indeed! Even that goddess’s dancing on the palm of moi hand this time! When that delinquent devil participated in the ceremony, she’d to ask for moi assistance to incubate the egg. She let me taste the negative emotions of absolute shame! Tormented by thy lust, thy love finally blossomed! But the moment thou achieved thy goal, the bride was snatched away! Thy negative emotions in that moment! It was so delicious that moi would have no regrets if moi was to be vanquished at that moment!
Well then, Sir Landlord. Moi have no further business with thee. Moi will take Maxwell back to hell and moi will continue to work harder under that crazy shop owner.
Yee! Yee! Vanir! Vanir! Before I go back, I’ve to let Alderp pay the price! He said he wants to pay the price!
I get it, I get it. The price, huh? I’ll pay, so hurry up…
… Huh, ah, ahhh?
Yee? Yee–! It hurts, it hurts!?
What are you doing? Release me, Max! Stop! It hurts, stop!
Hahaha! Maxwell, thou can continue with this in hell. This man owes thee a huge price. Just bring this man back to hell and let him pay back slowly.
The price thou need to pay for the service of Maxwell will be in accordance with the time stipulated in the contract, during which thou shall continuously release the negative emotions Maxwell likes… Yes, thou worked Maxwell really hard and led a really depraved life… Thou probably can’t clear the debt before the end of your lifespan.
I, I got it! It was wrong of me to work you so hard! How about this, first, my massive–
Thy wealth, huh? When Maxwell returns to hell, all thy wrongdoings will be exposed and all thy assets will be confiscated and managed by house Dustiness… After that, it’d be returned to that guy who’s regretting in his home, complaining that, ‘I shouldn’t have cockily thrown all my money away, I should mercilessly make that woman pay me back with her body.’, as well as the town and kingdom. Vanir, the devil that can see through everything, declares that thou art penniless.
In…
In that case, ‘Pick as many people as you like in this mansion in place of me.’, right? Unfortunately, the obligation of payment must be done by the contractee! … Oh, such negative emotion is hard to come by, but despair isn’t to moi taste. That’s what Maxwell prefers though.
M-M-Max… Max…! I-I did many cruel things to you… Cruel things. But, please, can you save me? Spare me Max, I don’t really hate you…! It’s true! Please, Max!
Alderp! Alderp! Me too! I like you too, Alderp!
Alderp! Alderp! I like you, Alderp! Stay by my side in hell, Alderp! I want to enjoy your despair forever, Alderp!
Oh, the feelings are mutual, Alderp. Maxwell’s the type who likes to go above and beyond, he’ll definitely toy with you all day and night! Hahaha! Hahaha!
I’ll cherish you, Alderp! Unlike the girls you abandoned after abducting them, I’ll take care not to break you! Yee–Yee–Yee–Yee–!!
The landlord’s missing?
Yes, the servants couldn’t find him anywhere.
For some reason, plenty of evidence indicating the landlord’s wrongdoings turned up. The one who gave Princess Iris the body swapping divine relic was him too. Some say the landlord couldn’t hide his evil deeds anymore and fled in the night.
… And so, there’s no need to flee anymore. Put down your bags.
Forget it, this is great too… What’s the matter, Darkness? Come in.
What is it, Darkness? Something happen?
That’s right, Megumin wasn’t in the church from the start, so you don’t know! Listen! Darkness was bought by Kazuma! Kazuma shouldered Darkness’s debt and even said, ‘You’re mine now! Pay back my hard earned money with your body.’…! Darkness’s scared of what Kazuma might do and doesn’t dare to come in, right?
… Hah?
Hey, let’s talk a little. A lot of the details are wrong. No, your content’s correct, but the fine details are off. And the way you put it’s terrible!
… No, that’s not the issue. Kazuma did ask me to pay back with my body and called me a perverted Crusader though…
Sorry. I troubled everyone because of my willfulness… Even I feel that I did something stupid. I hope everyone can forgive me…
Let bygones be bygones, you’re back safely after all. I don’t mind. Kazuma might’ve lost plenty of things, but this man has the habit of not wanting to work if he has money. This is just fine.
That’s right, or rather… If this didn’t happen, I wouldn’t have been able to visit Darkness’s house. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have noticed that your father had been cursed! … That’s right, we need to find the criminal who cursed him! I suspect it was done by that masked devil. My divine eyes can’t be mistaken! Let’s teach him a lesson!
I really owe Kazuma a huge favour this time. You abandoned everything and turned it into cash… It won’t be immediate, but the money Kazuma paid on my behalf will be returned by the kingdom in the future. When my father recovers, we’ll calculate the amount from the impounded property of the landlord. However, …
… However, the intellectual property you sold won’t come back. You mentioned that you were planning to live peacefully as a businessman, but now…
Forget about that. I learned cooking too, so setting up a small shop and making dishes from my country will earn me some pocket change… Huh, wait, the money will be returned to me?
Yes, it will be returned. The entire two billion used. The compensation for the landlord’s mansion and the cost of the damaged buildings will be reimbursed to you. After all, these are all costs that arose in the process of protecting this town. It should’ve been borne by the landlord managing this land in the first place… But now that I think of it, why’d I accept the proposal of the landlord to pay up…? As if I was hit by hypnosis. Also, why are evidences of his wrongdoings popping up all over the place…?
Two… You say two billion…?
Kazuma today feels really… Something– Really handsome! Hey Kazuma-san, I want an extravagant pet house for Emperor Zell!
That’s right, he’s really handsome. I always thought Kazuma’s a handsome guy. By the way, I want a magic item that enhances magical powers.
Ah, you are bunch of sluts who smelled gold! … Darkness, what is it?
Really, just let it go. You worked hard to cover for us all this while, right? Although going that far by yourself yesterday was really maddening, I’m a little glad too, So let’s call it even. And the entire sum will be returned as well, so isn’t that good enough? Let’s write off what happened yesterday.
Which means… What you said about buying me’s void too?
Of course it’s void! That’s it, forget about everything that happened yesterday!
… And, about that letter… The letter about leaving the party…
What are you talking about, Darkness’s our important Crusader. We’ll never let her go, right?
Right, forget about that now. Darkness likes pretending to be retarded sometimes. Isn’t the only place you can be right here with us?
E-Erm! My only strong point’s defense, I’m a Crusader who can’t even hit the enemy with my attacks… However, … However, may I… May I join your party again…?
Of course… Welcome back.
… I-I’m back!!
… Hey Kazuma, you still think it’s a pity, right? Letting Darkness pay you back with her body has some elements of lewdness, right?
Speaking of which, you announced to everyone that Darkness’s yours, right? What’s that? A confession of love? Like the time Yunyun said she wanted a baby and when you got tamed by Iris so easily in the capital, and now this. Why are you so easily won over? And you tried to make a move on me when we were sleeping together in the Crimson Demon Village too. You’re too frivolous. Be more serious about life.
… B-By the way, when Kazuma broke into my house last time, I almost crossed the line with him…
Eh?
H-Hey, don’t… Don’t say it… That was just a failed attempt…
Failed attempt?
Hey Kazuma, are you retarded? Megumin and I were working hard to bring Darkness back! What were you thinking?
Kazuma. You didn’t go to bring Darkness back, but went there for a night raid? Your stock value as a man has fallen into the abyss! Just what the hell were you doing?
Although I said night raid… He only barged into my room late in the night, covered my mouth before I could scream and pushed me down onto the bed. Then pressed me down so I couldn’t resist with my other hand… During the intense struggle, my clothes tore open and my stomach was toyed with.
Eh?
Hey, wait! No, that did happen! But…!!
?
I already know that Kazuma sees Darkness with lusty eyes, but to think you’re actually a man who’s fine with any woman… I thought Kazuma was a weakling but had an honest side. I thought you were somewhat serious that time, but you just wanted to get laid, huh? You can frolic with anyone in bed as long as it’s a woman, right? You trash!!
That’s right, when I was sleeping beside Kazuma in the stables in the past, this beast kept ogling my body!
That’s definitely impossible.
Why?
… You were the one who enticed me, asking if I wanted to become adults together…
!!
T-T-That’s wrong? I was thinking that since I was marrying the landlord, I might as well…!
You admitted! Darkness admitted that she started it! What a twist! …Well, I can read the mood too, so I’ll bring Emperor Zell’s egg to suntan in the park!
Darkness, you shameless slut! You were acting all prim and proper like the female lead in a tragedy, but you were actually just flirting around! I was wrong to worry about you!
Wait…? W-Wait a moment, stop!!
… Hey Aqua, a question. How does a family registrar for marriage work in this country?
Why are you asking that? First, on the morning of the ceremony, the couple will submit the family registering documents to the relevant authorities. In the afternoon, they’ll then hold the ce-re-mony…
…? What’s the problem?
I-It’s common to see people who’ve divorced once nowadays, yup!
Erm… How should this be interpreted? Darkness was abducted in the middle of the wedding. The next day, the groom had already run away. Theoretically speaking, Darkness was abandoned by that old man.
Well… Family registry’s just a trivial matter anyway. Don’t worry about it… Deserted-Wife-Ness.
– That’s what happened. Darkness then shut herself in her father’s home and refused to come out. I need to plan a one-man infiltration again.
You’re mean as usual. Don’t bully Darkness too much, okay? She might look strong, but is actually very delicate, you know?
Ara– I was busy with some other things. I was in the vicinity of Axel recently, but was called to go to some other place. I finally came back after settling my backlogs.
Called? By who? The thieves’ guild or something?
Eh, well, there are all sorts of things to settle after people die, right?
… You’re part timing in a funeral house?
To think that the divine relic was in the landlord’s mansion… When I infiltrated the landlord’s villa the other time, I was confused by the divine relic Aqua-san was holding–
Anyway, it ended well this time. Thank you for saving Darkness, Assistant-kun.
It was my pleasure, Big Boss.
Sigh… I still need to retrieve the other divine relics… Hey Assistant-kun, you…
Just to be clear, I’m a busy man.
The remuneration…
I don’t need money.
It can’t be helped then. I’ll look you up for help when the time comes, okay?
By the way, Eris-sama. Where’d you take the divine relic you retrieved from the landlord?
Oh, that one? I cast a seal onto it and dumped it into the lake where the Hydra’s resting eternally…
… What’s going on?
Excuse me, what’s this line for?
F-Frequent customer. What are you doing here at such a time?
A-A human! Why would a human appear at this time?
Oh no, we’ve been discovered! Will today’s sale be canceled?
N-No, it’s fine. This man is a frequent customer at our store. He already knows that we are succubi.
Well, you see, tonight, the store we are lined up in front of will release an extremely shocking gravure magazine.
I’m really looking forward to it ever since it was announced! I’ve been looking forward to this day!
I-I’ve been praying to the evil gods every day since it was announced…
That’s the situation, so… frequent customer, could you do us a favour and keep what you’ve seen here a secret?
Of course I’ll keep it a secret. Actually, I’ll line up too.
Eh?
Is-Is that really okay? I don’t know if I should be the one to say this, but it’s a really shocking gravure magazine. If a young devil who hasn’t developed much resistance to such matters were to read it, it might even cost them a few of their lives.
I want to see it even more.
J-Just who is that human? Does he have a death wish?
Don’t you know? He’s a frequent customer at our store, and is on friendly terms with Vanir-sama.
Thank you for lining up at my shop this late, everyone! Please, enter!
Hey, hurry up and flip the page! I want to see what’s next!
I-I understand how you feel, but calm down! D-Don’t let it get to your head! This page is way too stimulating…
Kyaa!
Oh! That’s why I said that you’re still too young for this. You just lost a life there.
Oh, my apologies, they are all sold out. The people still in line, please hold onto your tickets and await the next reprint.
Hey, hold it right there! Raising my expectations so much just to pull this on me!? Isn’t that too much!?
Oh? Moi was wondering why I was feeling such delicious dark emotions. So it’s because of this perverted brat who falls head over heels for succubi. What are you doing here?
I’m very interested in that extremely shocking gravure magazine. Is there really not a single copy left?
You aren’t a devil, so why are you interested in it? Well, you are an important customer. I do have a book I’ve been keeping on hand in the event of any errors, but…
How-How could this be? Frequent customer, you’re way too sly! At least give me a look!
Me too! Give me a peek too!
Aaah! V-V-Vanir-sama’s nude form…
T-This is amazing! I can’t believe that even the underside of Vanir-sama’s mask is…
You really are a strange man. To desire my gravure magazine, do you perhaps hold romantic feelings towards me? Sadly, us devils have no gender, so Moi cannot answer your feelings… Oh, that’s an intense swell of dark emotions! It’s delicious indeed!
Oh! It might be summer, but this attire is still too sexy. Are you trying to seduce me?
Hey, hey, what are you saying? Saying such things the moment you come back… The weather’s too hot so it can’t be helped, I’m not trying to seduce you…!
You might be saying that, but you’re actually looking forward to it a little, right?
What? What’s wrong with you today?
What’s happening all of a sudden? Kazuma might frequently sexually harass others, but he’s way too straightforward.
Megumin’s wearing a one piece today, huh? Megumin who has a boyish personality should go all out and just go naked.
What’s wrong with this guy? Why are you suddenly spouting such nonsense?
– A magic item that reveals your thoughts?
It was developed with the idea of realizing conversations with monsters and animals. By the way, Wiz wanted to test it out on animals. I think she mentioned about taking it to a beef farmer she knew for testing.
Why didn’t you stop Wiz? Wouldn’t that make it hard for the cow farmer to work?
What should I do? If I move the piece here, Megumin with her twisted personality will definitely target it. What should I do? Betting a side dish on one match was a bad idea. If this goes on, I can only eat condiments with rice tonight. I should’ve used rock-paper-scissors to decide the match. I would just need to cast blessing magic to settle it.
Hey, what are you doing Megumin? The board’s a mess now! The match’s void now, right? There isn’t enough time for another match, so let’s settle this with rock-paper-scissors!!
That surprised me, but this is a good chance! Did the weather get to her? It’s great that Megumin’s as impatient as Darkness!
So that’s how you think of me? I’m an Archwizard known for being cool and collected, nothing like Darkness at all!!
Wait, I don’t think I’m that impatient…! And what do the both of you usually think about me?
That’s how this magic item works… Oh, the big-tits girl’s still looking at me suspiciously. You wear it for a change then.
B-Big-tits girl? Is that how you call me in your mind? S-Stop! I don’t want to wear this thing, wear it yourself if you want!
Tch, I was planning to ask how many times you masturbate a day after you put it on.
A-An aristocratic lady won’t do something as shameless as masturbation! Ah, stop! Really, I’m not lying! I’m not lying, so don’t force the hat on me!!
Really… I think it’d be better if this magic item isn’t developed. Kazuma, take it off. Just tell Wiz what I said.
It can’t be helped. Forget it then. I was showered in cold glares by women on my way home too. I won’t dare go near that place for the time being.
What were you thinking on your entire way here? Were there any police patrolling the area?
By the way Aqua, the rock-paper-scissors just now’s void. To think that you’ll actually secretly cast blessing… Don’t be too rampant with your cheating. Let’s have another proper match!
H-How do you know? No, you’re just pulling a fast one. Where’s the evidence? Right, show the evidence that I actually secretly used magic!
Give it up, Aqua. Your dinner tonight will be rice with condiments.
Why–?
Thank you for tending to my tomb and telling me stories of adventures all this while.
What was that? … My imagination? No, I heard it pretty clearly…
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san–! The two of them are so mean! Hey, please make more dinner tonight!
Kazuma, Kazuma. I think it’s great to host this festival.
Thanks for helping the Axis Cult.
What are you doing here, Eris-sama?
– I’m not Eris-sama. I’m Chris-sama, okay?
No, no, no. This has been on my mind for some time. Eris-sama, in your current state, you’d only use honorifics when addressing your senior Aqua, right? You always call Darkness and Megumin directly by name.
… Because I’m a faithful and chivalrous thief who donates stolen money to the church. I can’t call the archpriest Aqua-sama by name.
When Eris-sama was troubled, she’d habitually scratch her cheek too.
Let me ask again– What are you doing here?
… Ha, well done, Kazuma-kun. No, I should say… Well done, Assistant-kun.
You’re right. It’s as you thought. Sometimes adventurer, sometimes chivalrous thief, and sometimes Darkness’s friend… But my real identity is…!
You’re unexpectedly enthusiastic, Eris-sama.
… Kazuma-kun, you’re unexpectedly calm… Since my cover was exposed, it can’t be helped. I’ll explain everything here–
But I really didn’t think that Big Boss would actually be Eris-sama. After all, your personalities and mannerisms are completely different. Oh, let me apologize. I’m really sorry that I stole Eris-sama’s panties when we first met.
Now that I think of it, there were other hints too. When we went to clear Keele’s dungeon and when Big Boss taught me the thief skills, you said such things before. Something like, ‘Because a senior who once took care of me was making unreasonable demands, I became really busy.’
You were busy dealing with the aftermath of Aqua forcefully reviving me after I was killed by the Winter Shogun, right? … Ah, I must apologize for that too. I’m very sorry for randomly groping you when I caught you infiltrating into the mansion.
Stop! Whatever, it’s fine! Or rather, stop reminding me of them!
Don’t call me Eris-sama right now, Kazuma-kun… No, Assistant-kun. Watch your mannerisms too. Don’t use a reverent tone, speak to me casually as you did before. Please treat me as Chris.
… Chris. If you say so, I don’t mind. Then, let me ask you some questions. Why are you in the mortal world? Why’s a goddess stealing? Also, which of your mannerisms and personalities are the real you?
W-Wait. I can’t answer if you ask so many questions at once!
Seriously… One of the reasons I’m in the mortal world is to find divine relics.
I see. That’s why you took the thief job, since it’d be more convenient to recover the divine relics. Unlike a certain goddess who only eats and sleeps, you’re really serious and responsible… You said this was one of the reasons. What are the other reasons?
Also, it was to be a friend to a certain noble lady who wished to have companions…
… What can I say? I feel that Eris-sama’s really a goddess.
I told you not to call me Eris-sama! … No, but I actually enjoyed adventuring with Darkness. My real identity is a secret between just the two of us, okay? Especially Darkness. Don’t ever let her know, okay?
Then, for my last question. Which mannerism and personality is real?
Between Chris and Eris, which one do you like?
I like both.
Uh… Oh… Is that so? I wasn’t expecting you to respond without hesitation. I thought you’d be… How should I say this? … The kind of person who hesitates at saying these confession-like words.
No. I wasn’t confessing. It’s just stating my plain preference… The tomboyish Big Boss and the soothing Eris-sama. I feel neither should be given up… Ah! If Chris and Eris could be swapped back and forth daily, it’d be like dating two people at the same time! That’s Eris-sama for you. You’re so awesome to be able to make a solo harem. Please go out with me…
You’re the worst!! You really are scum! Also, I told you not to call me Eris-sama!
Sigh… Really. A climatic scene like revealing my secret identity was ruined…
I’ve got nothing but bad premonitions– Are you going to make me find divine relics for you?
You caught on quickly, Assistant-kun! The divine relic this time’s the Sacred Armor Aigis. It was a set with the Sacred Shield Aegis, but we just need to find the armor this time…
La la la, I’m not listening! I don’t want to head down such dangerous roads anymore! Recently, my relationship with Megumin’s pretty good. Darkness seems to be somewhat interested in me too! And after receiving the large amount of money, there’s no need to work. I want to spend my decadent life with everyone affectionately!!
You just asked me to go out with you! What are you saying now? I can entrust only you with this job! Ah, hey, don’t cover your ears. Aren’t you going to obey your Big Boss’s orders?
Satou Kazuma-san. Please… For the sake of this world, could you please help me…?
Everyone. Humans are a species capable of conversation. Let’s talk this through.
You’re the one who profited most from that disturbance, right? It’s so good to be able to buy the rights to various products from Kazuma so cheaply… I heard about it. You resold Kazuma’s product rights at a high price and earned a huge profit. You’re so clever, so there must’ve been other solutions beside such indirect ones. Tell us the truth.
Vanir-san. What’ve you been doing behind my back? You resold the product rights you got cheaply from Kazuma-san? Unbelievable…! Ah, what should I do? To think that money in the vault came from blackmailing Kazuma-san…! I want to return it, but the money’s already…!
My house’s Vanir has troubled you. I’m sorry, so sorry.
Calm down, gangster girl and destitute shop owner. Although there are other ways to solve this… Problem…? … Wait. Thou disaster of a shop owner, what did thou just say? What happened to the money moi left in the vault? That isn’t an amount that can be spent so easily.
About that– Praise me, Vanir-san. Actually, while I was tending the shop, a regular patron of mine brought a lot of manatites. He said he’d sell them to me at half price, so I used all the money in the vault to buy them! I really bought some good stuff this time! Based on my evaluation, those were definitely high grade manatites!
Forget it. I didn’t think you’d do that much. But I’ll ask you this. According to Aqua, Darkness’s father was under a devil’s curse… And you’re the only devil in this city.
Hahaha. Moi would never use a curse that could kill the victim! The one who placed the curse was an arch-devil with strange mannerisms and a screw loose in the head.
Isn’t that you?
Wait. Dost thou think that a gentleman like moi would be a broken devil with strange mannerisms? Come on, let’s be reasonable! Moi admit that moi did a lot of circuitous matters this time. Moi admit that things developed so moi could taste the negative emotions of the lord after his bride was snatched away. But moi wish thou will listen to moi explanation. Especially thou, who’s been staring at moi since earlier, who developed strong feelings for that guy over there after this incident, who changed all the clothes thou wears in the house to thin, flimsy material…
Ahhh! Revenge for killing my father!!
Hey, don’t break my mask! Don’t intentionally break my mask! And your father’s not dead!
Kazuma. It seems Vanir’s confirmed to be the mastermind behind the incident. I think I can go outside the city for my daily Explosion now. Kazuma, if you don’t mind, could you come with me?
Fine. This doesn’t seem like it’ll end soon anyway, so I’ll go with you. They should’ve calmed down when we return.
– By the way, I haven’t thanked you yet.
Thanks? What for? … Ah, is it for apologizing to those parents after you made their kid cry? That was in the past. But from now on, don’t bully a kid just because he calls you names, okay?
N-Not that pathetic matter! And I wasn’t in the wrong then. It was that kid’s fault for looking down on Crimson Demons!
I want to thank you for saving Darkness.
That incident, huh? Darkness owes me too much. I won’t let her leave the party so easily. Besides, it wasn’t the first time I cleaned up after you all. There’s no need for thanks at this point.
Even so, it’s still necessary. I’ve said this before back in the Crimson Demon village…
You complain a lot. But in the end, you’ll still help everyone. I truly like you the way you are.
… Hey, seriously, don’t just say such things so casually. I don’t know whether to take it seriously or not. I remembered you saying this before, but just casually say that you like me. I’ll take it the wrong way. What does it mean? Should I take it as a confession?
Who knows? You can interpret it whichever way you like.
About that… Megumin, I’m very happy about your feelings. Actually, I’m also…
Explosion–!!
What happened to you? Why are you so annoyed?
Kazuma. Did you say something when I was casting Explosion magic? I didn’t hear anything because of the explosion, but I felt you were saying something important.
Nothing! I feel nothing about Megumin!
What are you annoyed about? You’re even being coy. You should keep such bad tempers in check. When we get back home, I’ll give you one extra pudding that I bought the last time.
… I’ll forgive you if you give me two more.
I can’t give you two more. Including Aqua’s and Darkness’s share, there’s only one extra. If you get two more, someone will have nothing to eat…
Give it back! Come on, give it back! Give my cute Emperor Zell back to me!! Wah! Give it back!
Hahaha! You deserve it, you cuckolded goddess. Your precious pet… Hahaha… Damn it, hey! Go away, bird. Go back to your owner!
Chirp.
– So, what’s going on here?
It was this person!
Listen to me! Listen to me, Kazuma! When we were interrogating this weird masked guy, he suddenly attacked us! He even shouted Vanir-style whatever! I deflected it with magic, but it hit Darkness and she collapsed. I counter-attacked with purification magic! Then this guy used Wiz as a shield and caused her to nearly vanish! When I decided to destroy this guy…!
Hahaha. Thou only mention the things beneficial to thyself, ye insidious woman! This woman, along with that muscle woman and that traitorous shop owner declared the innocent moi to be guilty! Moi couldn’t possibly accept a judgment without a lawyer, so I acted in self-defense by attacking with my Vanir-style Death Ray. Then, this fellow reflected moi ray to that muscle woman. Then, this unreasonable woman used magic on moi in revenge. Moi promptly used the shop owner as a shield to ensure my safety. When moi decided to settle it all at once…!
Emperor Zell was born!
The name isn’t bad. It’s a name full of majesty. No wonder it wants to stay close to moi.
Of course it’s good. Who do you think gave its name? It’s unacceptable for it to be close to you, but this kid was chosen by a goddess like me. It’s destined to become the emperor of dragons.
… So what should we do about this thing? How about fried chicken?
No way! Kazuma, you’re inhuman! Sometimes, I feel that this masked devil has more humanity than you!
Don’t be rude, cuckolded goddess. This man’s evil is unmatched in Axel since the disappearance of the evil lord. Don’t compare him to moi, who’s popular for patrolling the area when children go home from school.
… Why’s a newborn so cute? Is its cuteness a defense mechanism against predators?
In any case, you’re hindering Emperor Zell’s education, so get lost. I’ll let this kid receive elite education… Look at Megumin’s decadent expression as she looks at Emperor Zell. She’s totally seduced. Emperor Zell’s born a lady killer. It’s said that beautiful women are weak against a heroic male. His future’s bright.
Hmph. No need for ye to say. Moi will be leaving anyway. After all, the money moi earned has all been turned to rocks by that liability of a shop owner. Well then, goodbye humans. Please patronize Wiz’s Magic Tool Shop again when thou has saved some money!
Hey. Sorry, but can thou give moi some sugared water? Left alone like this, this undead lich will become a dead lich. Let her regain some nutrients, give her some sugared water and she’ll revive like a bug.
Ah! W-What is it, Emperor Zell?
… Hmm?
Wah–! Emperor Zell’s been stolen! Kazuma! Kazuma! Please, destroy this masked devil and return Emperor Zell to me!
No. Why should I do it? You’re capable of dealing with Vanir. Anyway, it’s just a chick, not a dragon. Why can’t you accept this?
If I destroy the masked devil, Emperor Zell who’s close to him will hate me… Maybe the blind Kazuma can’t distinguish it, but this kid’s a rare breed of dragon with fur, the shaggy dragon.
I understand why you don’t want to admit that you were cheated, but give it up. This guy’s definitely a normal chick.
Hey, Darkness isn’t showing any sign of recovery. Is this a problem?
Well, her wound should be healed by the goddess over there. But it’s amazing to still be alive after receiving moi Vanir-style Death Ray. True to its name, the ray kills anyone it hits. Moi wants to know why she isn’t dead yet. Perhaps her magic resistance’s ridiculously high… But this incident will hurt moi reputation as a harmless person. After that woman wakes up, ask her for moi, ‘How thick are thy muscles?’
I’ll get beaten up for that… Forget it. So, what should we do with this thing?
Well. It can’t be helped to fall in love with moi who art an idol in the eyes of women. But the difference in species between birds and devils is simply too great. Although moi feel sorry for Emperor Zell, he just has to give up on moi.
No, it evidently considers you as its parent.
… It can’t be helped then. Hey, where’s Emperor Zell’s nest?
Shred!
Then, moi will be leaving.
I think that I’m familiar with the creatures of this world by now, but you’re the wackiest of them all.
… Hey Kazuma. Can you not eat eggs in front of Emperor Zell? I feel that the kid’s shivering as it looks at you.
Isn’t it a dragon? If so, it has no reason to fear someone like me… Rather, can you do something about Vanir’s empty shell? Its sense of presence is too strong. I can’t eat in peace while that thing’s staring.
This can’t be helped. After all, Emperor Zell likes this… Anyway, what’s up with that little one now?
It looks like it’s afraid of this yellow fur ball.
Probably because of magic power.
Magic power?
Yes. Magic power. I can sense great magic power from Emperor Zell.
It’s probably because it received magic power from the most magically powerful people in this city, namely Aqua, Vanir, Wiz, and myself, when it was still in the egg. When a dragon incubates its eggs, it‘ll channel magic power into them to keep warm, allowing the baby dragons to hatch with great magic power. It’s a famous legend, but it’s surprising that the same phenomenon happened with a chicken egg. This may be good news to the people who rear dragons.
Then, if we take care of it, it could eventually become a trump card against the Devil King…
Nope. It’s just a chicken after all. It can’t use magic, it can’t use magic power to fly like a dragon, and it can’t exhale dragon breath.
Then will it awaken to great power one day? Its magic power could induce it to become a chicken with super physical attributes…
That’s impossible. Magic power can control aging and extend one’s lifespan, but this kid’s just an ordinary chicken. It won’t awaken any special power. At most, it’ll use its vast magic power to frighten off wild monsters.
Ah! Right. Then, I can use the Drain Touch skill to use this fellow as a substitute manatite and replenish magic power.
That won’t work either. It’s just an ordinary chicken. If you’re not careful, you can drain its life force and it’ll die.
… If I eat this fellow, will it instantly boost my magic power?
… I don’t know. I don’t really want to do that since it’s cute, but if it can instantly increase magic power, it might be worth a try.
If you’re going to look at my kid like that, then get lost! Darkness, you must protect Emperor Zell from these two people!
… Ha. Looking at you people, I feel like I’ve really returned. Kazuma, Megumin, don’t bully Aqua too much. We must live together peacefully from now on. No more quarrels. Let’s get along.
… You shut yourself at home, but now that you’ve come out, your mood’s improved. After being abandoned by that old lord, is your emotional scar really healed? But I feel that a used woman who’s still a virgin’s quite new and refreshing. It’s not bad for you to keep accumulating attributes.
I wasn’t abandoned! The lord went missing because he ran away after his corruption was exposed! … And I’m not a used woman. My family registry’s still clean and pure.
…? … Ah! You used the privilege of nobility to tamper with the records! Hey Megumin, look at what she’s become. She acted cool before by saying that the Dustiness family wouldn’t abuse its political power, but this is what she does the moment there’s trouble.
Darkness has truly changed a lot since then. She’s no longer stubborn and inflexible. Her brain has probably softened because she’s being influenced by Kazuma.
Both of you, stop it! Actually, Darkness’s a very dreamy girl, okay? She likes cute dresses even though she says they don’t suit her. She likes dolls too. She’s a good girl who’ll take note of when nobody else’s around so she can secretly play with Emperor Zell! Such a pure and lovable Darkness merely tampered with her family registry a bit… Ah. What are you doing, Darkness? I was defending you!
Sorry to intrude… Everyone, it seems rather joyful today too.
– That’s how it is. I requested Assistant-kun’s help before, but if possible, I hope everyone can help find the divine relics.
I’d like to help you… But sorry, Chris. Because the lord’s currently missing, I must perform the lordship duties on behalf of my father who hasn’t recovered yet. Therefore, I can only help out after my father’s health has recovered…
No problem. After all, your work’s more important. I’m happy that you wanted to help me. Thank you, Darkness.
I’ll help if I can, but my capabilities are very limited, okay? If those divine relics are in the hands of villains, I can help you to threaten them with Explosion magic.
Th-Thank you, Megumin. If there’s need to trouble you, I’ll ask for you then. Uh, then…
It’s regrettable. I can’t help.
Other than feeding the chick, you’re just idling away, right? You’re the idlest out of everyone here. Go and help her.
Kazuma. Do you understand a parent’s feelings?
… What are you asking all of a sudden? If I understood such things, my online friends wouldn’t call me Kazuma-kun Who Made His Mother Cry.
Yes, that’s true, that’s Kazuma for you. You just played games every day without going to school and ignored any attempts to urge you to go to school. So hopeless… But even a useless son like you is adorable in a parent’s eyes.
Hopeless kids are cute. I know that, but I want this kid to become stronger than everyone, become the most respected dragon! Elite education is a necessity for it to rise to the top of the dragon world… So the clever me thought of this. Look, people say that kids grow up watching the silhouettes of their parents, right? So, I intend to let this kid see how powerful and respected I am.
What exactly do you intend to do?
I think that my current power’s slightly insufficient to defeat the Demon King, so that’ll be the last resort.
… I don’t know what kind of power you have that’s slightly insufficient to defeat the Demon King, but didn’t you originally intend to use this chick as a fighting force against the Demon King? It seems your premise has changed.
Kazuma, what are you saying? How can I let my cute kid do such dangerous things?
You’re the one talking nonsense.
But letting it witness my power can wait. Compared to that, currently there’s an even more important event.
Has everyone heard of the Goddess Eris Thanksgiving Festival?
This city will be hosting the Eris Festival, right? My village has done it too. It’s said that if you dress up as the goddess of luck Eris on that day, you’ll spend the next year safely until the next festival.
My family participates in the Eris Festival annually. Every generation of the Dustiness family has always been respected by Eris cultists. We donate a lot of money every year to the festive event.
This means that we can see people cosplaying as Eris-sama in this city… Hey, I’m somewhat looking forward to this!
Is it? I don’t quite like that celebration because it’s just women who dress up as the goddess Eris.
That information’s unnecessary.
Everyone, why are you being excited? I’m not asking everyone to enjoy the celebration! I’m being left aside… Ouch, ouch, ouch! Emperor Zell, why are you pecking me? What about mommy are you dissatisfied with?
What are you trying to say?
Since there’s an Eris Festival, it’d be unfair not to have an Aqua Festival. Let’s put an end to the Eris Festival this year and replace it with the Aqua Festival!
Don’t you think it’s very unfair? There’s an Eris Festival, yet why is there no celebration for Aqua, who’s Eris’s senior? Isn’t it fine for me to take her place once in a while? I want to let Emperor Zell see my awesomeness!
And I don’t know why Eris is so popular! That kid looks very demure but she’s actually very naughty, okay? And she takes responsibility for many things on her own initiative. She’s a boring girl who tries to do everything by herself. I helped that immature kid clean up her mess so many times!
What’s she talking about? Did you really let her help you lots of times?
… J-Just once. Because I was continuously doing the work senpai pushed to me, my own work began to pile up without me realizing… When I was troubled by this, senpai said with self-satisfaction, ‘Really, you’re hopeless! Eris just can’t do without me!’ and helped me out…
Seriously. Aqua, do you know that the reason you have such bad luck is because you always make impertinent remarks to belittle Eris-sama? Aqua’s repeated sufferings are no doubt divine retributions from Eris-sama.
What! So when a wild dog I was playing with suddenly chased and bit me, and when my ice cream dropped on the floor, it was all Eris’s doings? Why’s that cute wench Eris like this?
Uh, whatever it is. Of course I won’t be helping. I’ve said earlier, I’ve got a lot of lordship duties to perform. I won’t be able to find time to be with you during the celebration.
Why? I just joined Kazuma to rescue you from marriage. I even removed the curse placed on your father!
Ugh… I-If you say that, I’ll have nothing to retort. But I’m still a devout Eris cultist…
Enough. Darkness is a used woman and an abandoned bride!
Wait, Aqua, this nickname’s…!
Megumin? What about you, Megumin? You will help out, right?
A used woman, an abandoned bride…
I’ve no problem with that, since I’m not an Eris cultist. I also know some Axis cultists who took care of me previously.
?
That’s my Megumin! Kazuma will of course–
Not do it.
Come and help, you damn NEET! You’re sleeping all the time! Please! I’ll let you feed Emperor Zell! Only once!
No! Why’s feeding that chick considered a reward?
Uh, I kind of want to feed it…
Anyway, it’s impossible to end the Eris Festival. The Eris cultists would go berserk, right?
Eh… It’s Kazuma’s job to resolve such issues…
Are you joking?
Forget it, petty Kazuma! I’ll resolve everything together with Megumin and Chris!
Eh–?
Kazuma, how much longer are you going to sleep? Are you dressed? You’re not doing anything weird, right? You aren’t, right? I’m coming in! … Why’s it so cold?
Hey, stop shouting in the morning. Close the door or the cold air will escape.
I keep saying every time– It’s noon already. And why is the room so cold? Is the Winter Shogun in your closet? Our house already has Chomusuke and Emperor Zell. We don’t need another pet, okay?
Why would I keep such a dangerous thing as a pet? Look at the corners of the room. There are buckets in every corner, right? There’s ice inside them.
Where did you get ice in the hot summer? I want some ice to help me sleep at night too.
Remember when Wiz said that she bought a lot of high grade manatite? I had an idea. Using the power of money, I bought the manatite cheaply in bulk, then used Freeze to create a lot of ice. This makes the room really cool even in the summer so I can daydream under my blanket. There are few things more enjoyable than this.
Kazuma, your ability to waste money and magic’s unsurpassed… Say, tonight will probably be hot too. Can you make some ice for me as well?
Sure, but why are you here now? Aren’t you going to the Axis Cult Church today?
Kazuma’s never been loved, so you probably don’t know this feeling. But isn’t it a bit embarrassing to ask my worshippers to host a celebration to praise myself? So I hope that someone will accompany me and insinuate them to host the event.
You dare to say that to me, who’s been popular among single female adventurers and receptionists after I made a ton of money? You never cared about the mood and did whatever you pleased, so why are you so bothered about it now? I already said that I won’t be helping yesterday. I don’t want to have anything to do with Axis cultists. You should ask Megumin or Darkness instead.
I begged Darkness many times, but she says she’s busy with lordship duties. Megumin says she’s meeting someone today, so she can’t play with me.
Hey, what are you doing with that? I won’t go. The weather’s too hot to be running around outside today. S-Stop it! What are you doing to my blanket? I just dried it in the sun, don’t wet it! I won’t forgive you if you wet… Fine, I’ll go, so put down that bucket!
Here we are. It looks like a very small church, but this accentuates the humility of the Axis cultists. It feels very nice.
This church feels like it’ll collapse if the wind blows too hard.
What’s the person in charge of this church like? He isn’t someone with an intense personality, right? We’ve got too many people with awfully strong personalities. I’m leaving if it turns out to be some weirdo.
Everyone in the Axis Cult is a good person, so don’t worry. I’ve never met the person in charge of the church in this town, but It seems a new person has recently taken up the post…
See. No problem, right? Verify it… Seriously, don’t make me deal with these kinds of goods again.
… Certainly, I was right to look you up. This are definitely first grade goods. Anyway, there’s nothing to worry about. There isn’t any danger once I got used to it. It’s only for my personal enjoyment, after all.
It’s best that way. Even so, don’t drown yourself in pleasure and overdo it. It’s caused deaths every year, so be careful.
Hey Aqua. Let’s go to the police station.
W-Wait! My children aren’t criminals! This must be a misunderstanding! Don’t jump to conclusions before we find out what’s happening!
Your cultists’ provocation and sexual harassment of Eris cultists are already crimes.
Seriously. You never change. Do you really like this white powder so much?
Is this really that good? I remembered you recommended it to me before. I want to try it out too.
Little girl. This looks like ordinary white powder, but if you add hot water…
In that case, why don’t you try it? Don’t worry, Megumin. Everyone’s a little afraid at first, but after you try it, you’ll be addicted…
– This is it, you evil cultists!! What are you doing to my companion? Do you have a death wish?!
K-Kazuma? Why are you here…? Even Aqua’s…!
Who cares why! Stop right there, criminal scum! I’m a famous adventurer in this city. If you resist, don’t blame me if you get hurt!!
W-Wait! Although this is a banned item, it’s for my personal use only…
Who’d believe that nonsense! You were just trying to entice my companion! Stop joking. How are you going to compensate if my companion becomes even weirder after using that thing?! I’ll use Tinder and burn those damn things away!
God Blow!!
Wait! What are you two doing? Why’d you suddenly barge in?
Megumin, shut up! Hey, you evil priestess who attempted to entice an innocent girl into misdeeds! I’m someone who supports gender equality, so I’ll raise my hand even against a woman with a sacred job. As retribution for enticing my companion to play with this weird thing, I’ll let you feel my sacred fist on behalf of a goddess who can’t set a good example for her worshippers.
Hey Kazuma. Don’t be so quick to judge! This kid must have some mitigating circumstances! This man here probably isn’t an Axis cultist, so I passed judgment. But I can sense the aura of an Axis cultist from her! I think we should let her explain first!!
You’re? … Ah, for such a thing to happen… Ha. I mustn’t be rude. Fine, I lose. If you want to burn this or hand me over to the police, do as you wish…
If you surrender, we won’t do anything to you, but please cooperate with the police. Pay for your crimes there.
Okay. I know… Ha. Megumin, are you still willing to call me Onee-san? Don’t worry. After I pay for my crime, we’ll meet again… Yes, probably around this evening…
… This evening? What are you saying? Why would you be released so soon?
What are you saying? Illegal possession of tokoroten slime will at most be punished with a lecture for about an hour.
… What’s that slime? Is it poison or a drug that makes you high…?
Nothing like that. It isn’t so dangerous. Tokoroten slime’s easily swallowed and feels elastic in the mouth. It’s a popular food among kids and old people.
… But, from the conversation earlier… Don’t some people die from this yearly…?
Because of the food’s nature, a lot of people swallow without chewing properly, so some choke to death every year. I heard this was the favorite thing for wives to give to their mother-in-laws.
No, but isn’t it a banned item? And the white powder? The possession itself is a crime, right?
Previously in Alcanretia, the Demon King’s army used tokoroten slime as part of a terrorist attack… It involved turning all the hot springs in the city to tokoroten slime. After that, the nation decreed that tokoroten slime must have dangerous side effects for the Demon King’s army to use it, so they started an investigation… In the end, the law banned the consumption of tokoroten slime before the investigation could confirm that it was safe to use.
But to me, tokoroten slime’s irreplaceable! So even though I know I’ll be lectured, I still do it…!
You, devout Axis cultist… Remember the seventh doctrine of the Axis Cult.
The seventh doctrine…? …! ‘You shall not endure. Drink when you want to drink. Eat when you want to eat. Because you might not get to eat it tomorrow…’
That’s right. You shall not endure. Even if it’s fried chicken in someone else’s bowl, eat it if you want to. If you want to eat tokoroten slime, don’t hold yourself back. After all, holding it back isn’t good for the body.
Ah… Aqua-sama, thank you…!!
Hey, what should we do? Should we stop them? Or is it better not to get involved?
If you’re asking that, it’s definitely better not to get involved. If you leave it alone, it will probably stop by itself… Anyway, why are you here? Aqua said she wanted me to accompany her somewhere this morning. Was this the place?
… So you thought I was being enticed by weirdos into misdeeds and charged in?
Yes. I’m sorry. You’re familiar with that priestess, right? I’ve caused you trouble because of the misunderstanding.
It’s nothing. After all, you were so worried about me, huh? I remember it was, ‘– This is it, you evil cultists!! What are you doing to my companion? Do you have a death wish?!’, right? Ha. I got another of Kazuma’s quotes to remember.
D-Don’t. Forget it, I was too anxious then… Hey, stop giving me that cheeky look or I’ll pull on your face. Hey.
Ah–!
What’s happening? What’s with this person!? To make Megumin smile so coyly! Megumin even has that slutty tsundere look! Ah! Megumin’s still so cute! Can I hug you?
P-Please don’t. Anyway, I haven’t introduced all of you to this Onee-san, right?
Kazuma, Aqua, let me introduce you. This is Cecily-san. She’s the manager of this church. Uh, her relationship with me is…
I’m her older sister.
Please don’t invent fictitious relationships! Uh, I should say she took care of me previously…
Let me formally introduce myself… Pleased to meet you, Aqua-sama. I heard about you from our church’s highest ranking official Lord Zesta. My name’s Cecily. If I can be of use in any way, please let me know.
Oh. You’ll do anything? There’s a hole in my sock, will you buy me a new pair?
Of course, Aqua-sama! I’ll naturally serve you and help you wear the socks… Ah. What are you doing? Even though I’m pretty, it’s wrong for you to do such things!
Hey, she’ll get carried away if you dote on her too much. By the way, why are you so devoted to Aqua whom you only just met…? Has the Axis Cult realized her true identity?
I don’t know what you’re talking about. Aqua-sama’s Aqua-sama. She’s the Archpriest who saved our city. She’s the Archpriest who’s named after our goddess. She merely shares the name of our goddess. I came to this city to serve Aqua-sama and rely on her brilliance to spend my days leisurely.
Can you please return to Alcanretia?
Uh, you’re Megumin’s acquaintance, Cecily-san, right?
Don’t be so formal. You can be more casual. You can call me Cecily-nee.
… Uh, you know… Actually, this city will host the Goddess Eris Thanksgiving Festival soon–
I know! Of course, I know! Those damn Eris cultists plan to leave our Aqua-sama in the lurch with this ridiculous Eris Festival!
It’s the summer season. What do you think of in summer? Yes, of course it’s the sea, the pool, and the Axis Cult. Then, what do you associate with celebration? Of course it’s the Axis Cult. We love banquets, celebrations, and summer. To leave the Axis Cult aside and host the Eris Festival during summer’s practically provoking us. That’s right. This is war. There’s no choice but war!
Therefore, I’ll divide up the roles. I’ll smash the windows of Eris Church. Megumin will coolly declare herself and get rid of the angry Eris cultists who’ll be chasing me. You’ll sneak into the crowd and mutter, ‘Divine retribution has befallen on those evil Eris cultists…’ and other such meaningful statements. Aqua-sama will just relax here and drink some wine… Then, let’s do this!!
I won’t let you do this. There are too many things to complain about!! … You people, don’t give me that look as if you really want to try it out!
I don’t mean that. Uh, I feel that you can start hosting something like the Goddess Aqua Thanksgiving Festival celebration as a resistance.
Pleased to meet you. I’m Cecily, the manager of Axis Cult’s Axel branch. I have something I need to discuss.
Please leave.
What’s this? I was being so polite. What are you dissatisfied with? … Ha. It seems you intend to reject me first then blackmail me later. You’re going to say this, right– ‘Hahaha. Pretty priestess of the Axis Cult, if you want me to grant your request, then show me some sincerity.’ And then, you’ll do that to my voluptuous body…! I won’t let you heathens have your way. I’ll show you the power of an Axis cultist!
What a crazy woman! This is why I refuse to have dealings with Axis cultists. Stop, wait! Someone help!
… Hey Megumin. She’s your friend, right? Go and stop her.
Not a friend, just an acquaintance. Please don’t misunderstand.
Cecily-san. Things won’t progress like this. Go and take a rest, I’ll persuade him for you.
You said that you’ll persuade me on her behalf, but no matter who… Hmm? Are you that billionaire adventurer, Satou Kazuma-san?
Actually, regarding this year’s Goddess Eris Thanksgiving Festival. We wish to change it to the Goddess Aqua Thanksgiving Festival…
Please leave.
…! … Ugh!
Things really can’t progress if you keep doing this. Onee-san, please come here! Let’s go and play!
My companion has caused you trouble. Sorry about that… But our purpose here’s related to what she said.
The Goddess Aqua Thanksgiving Festival mentioned by that Axis cultist? Impossible. I don’t know what the Eris cultists will say if we do that…
No. Unlike that Axis cultist, I’m not making an unreasonable suggestion like changing the festival. I wish to host both festivals at the same time. Make it into Goddesses Eris and Aqua Thanksgiving Festival. Everyone will be satisfied with that.
That won’t be permitted. It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. And it doesn’t seem like there’s any benefit…
The Goddess Eris Thanksgiving Festival is supported by the merchant district stalls every year, so the annual income must be good, right?
Uh, I’d be lying if I said there’s no profit. But lately, due to the Demon King’s army becoming more active, it wasn’t as grand as before… So what about it?
Eris cultists and Axis cultists. Their relationship isn’t very good–but it’s only the Axis Cult which shows hostility. If the festival is co-hosted by both cults, what would happen? Since Axis cultists love celebrations, they’ll compete with the Eris Church and make the celebration go into full swing. Then, the Eris Church wouldn’t sit by and do nothing.
… Please elaborate.
Let them compete with each other. The more aggressive their competition turns into, the grander the celebration will become. Naturally, the merchant district will benefit and increase profits.
… One more thing. Where do the annual funds for the festival come from?
Funds? Most of it comes from the donations of the Eris Church. The rest comes from various aristocrats and our merchant district fundraising…
Isn’t it great to let the Axis Cult, which wants to co-host the celebration, contribute to the funds? This way, perhaps just the Eris Church and the Axis Cult alone will raise enough funds.
… Do it then. Please do it this way! Wow. That’s our young and wealthy Kazuma-san for you. I’d like you to be our advisor for this celebration event… Of course, you’ll be compensated…
If you don’t mind, I’ll be the advisor. I’ve got a lot of good ideas. Let’s make a profit out of this.
Hahaha! This really is a good deal!
Is it really okay to leave it to him?
Even I, your Onee-san, feel somewhat uneasy.
– And that’s how it went.
Why? Why did it become like this? I thought it’d never be approved. How did senpai convince the merchant district chairman?
Well, convincing the chairman took some effort, but it ended in a success.
So it was you–?
Why? You’re so afraid of trouble, so why’d you make things so troublesome? In this case, I’ve got no choice but to leave aside my own festival to help out with senpai’s festival! This is just crazy!
No, no. Why’s it a given that you’ll help her? You should just reject her outright.
That’s true… But whenever senpai asks for help, I’ll naturally do it… Like cleaning up the mess after your resurrection. Somehow, that became part of my job too…
A-About that… Thanks for taking care of me then… But calm down. There are good reasons for this.
That’s roughly what it’s like. Because of the problem with the Demon King’s army, the populace can’t get excited about the festival. So I proposed co-hosting it with the party-loving Axis cultists. This is to let the people forget about the Demon King’s army and fully enjoy the festival.
If you put it like that, I can’t object… But are you really the kind of person to think of the citizens?
Hey, what are you saying? I’m the kind person who not only defeated countless strong enemies, but is also helping you to find divine relics.
S-S-Sorry! I-I didn’t mean it that way…! Hmm. I understand. That should be fine. Senpai probably won’t be too outrageous… Right?
… Leaving that aside for not, co-hosting is merely a one-time experiment. Given Aqua’s personality, just hosting it once should be enough to satisfy her. It should be back to normal next year.
Hey, why didn’t you answer about her being outrageous? Is it r-really okay? … And will my celebration be cancelled next year if the Axis Cult’s festival’s grander? … No. I-It’s not like I want to be honored in a festival, okay?
Let’s leave this for now. The important thing is… Have you found the divine relic yet?
Yes. I found the location. But it’s being kept in a rather difficult place. The current owner’s a noble named Undine. This person has a hobby of collecting strange items.
If the other party’s a noble, maybe we could ask Darkness for help? Use the authority of Darkness’s family to make things easier…
No way. Undine probably used illegal methods to acquire this divine relic, so he’ll definitely deny it. He’s a noble known for using unscrupulous methods to get what he wants. Even if Darkness negotiates with him, he’ll end it with a simple ‘I didn’t know such a thing existed.’
Then, it’s going to be that, Big Boss?
Yes. It’ll be that, Assistant-kun.
Darkness! Please. I’ll help you to lecture him when Kazuma returns, so please come out of the toilet! I’ll be troubled if you stay in there, ! The toilet on the second floor is jammed because someone didn’t clean it properly! I beg you, come out! Come out already!
I’m back. Hey, what’s going on? What’s this about lecturing me?
Hey, you damn NEET! It’s your fault for spreading Darkness’s shameful secrets. Darkness was crying when she returned! ‘Young Lady Lalatina, is it true that your abs have six packs?’, ‘Young Lady Lalatina, is it true that your groom ran away?’, ‘Young Lady Lalatina is so pretty, so men will still want her even if she’s a used woman,’ and such. She said that every adventurer she met said such things! I say, come out already, Darkness. You can definitely find a new groom! I won’t call you a used woman anymore! Please don’t be angry!
Hey Darkness. You’re causing trouble for everyone, so come out quickly. When I infiltrated into the Dustiness mansion and said that I would reveal your shameful secrets, you replied that I could do whatever I want. But never mind. Consider it my fault, Lalatina.
I know I’m at fault, but you’re partly responsible, too. It takes two hands to clap. I apologize, okay? Let’s make up… I can find a random place to solve it, so it’s not a big problem. But if you don’t come out, Aqua will be in trouble. Don’t be angry anymore.
A goddess doesn’t use the toilet, so there’s no trouble! The toilet on the first floor’s my responsibility! If Darkness doesn’t come out, I can’t clean it! There’s no other reason! So come out already!
Hey Darkness. We’ve known each other for some time now, so you should understand me. If you don’t come out of the toilet, I’ll make you cry and beg me to stop.
You too. After knowing me for so long, you should know that most things will just be pleasurable to me. Are you going to attack me with vicious words? I control the toilet. No matter what you say, if I cover my ears and endure it, you’ll be the one who’s disadvantaged. The Dustiness Clan has always been good at enduring things… Let’s compete for endurance! I’ll stay here until you apologize and say, ‘Lady Dustiness, please forgive me!’
Hey Darkness. Kazuma said he’s going to ransack your room and satisfy his desires on your bed, then he left.
Kazuma! Stop! Stop, despicable man! Hey, stop! St…! You’re joking, right? Aqua! Kazuma’s actually still there, right? Megumin! Kazuma’s still outside, right?
He isn’t here.
Kazuma, I was wrong! It’s my fault…! Hey, let me out. I can’t come out! Aqua, Megumin, let me out! Kazuma, I’m sorry, I apologize! Sorry! Please forgive me, Kazuma-sama!
… Ugh. My favorite underwear has been…
… Uh, what happened to Darkness after that?
If you want to know, ask Darkness for details. Aqua, I got the festival permit for you, so can you settle the rest?
Of course. There won’t be any problem once I get the permit, so leave the rest to me. I have my own plans.
Hey Kazuma. How’d you get the festival permit?
Fig… Oh, the merchant district chairman said that letting the Eris Church and the Axis Cult co-host the festival will make it grander than before.
The permit was really granted, huh? How did…? No. It was you after all. You must’ve used some underhanded methods, so I won’t inquire further. Ah. Why’d this happen when I’m acting as lord…?
Hmm…? This pasta’s tasty. Or rather, today’s food is good. Although it isn’t up to the standard of my House’s chef, it’s good enough to sell in shops. Who cooked the dishes today?
Me… Oh right. You probably didn’t know because you were in the mess with the previous lord at that time. I learned Cooking. You see, I won’t have to worry about money now, so I’m thinking of living casually from now on. Compared to skills that are useful only while adventuring, aren’t these skills that can improve my lifestyle much better?
Y-You…? When you were learning the escape skill, I already had a bad premonition. What are you trying to become? … Usually, only chefs will learn the Cooking skill.
Assistant-kun, why’d you choose this time? Wouldn’t a bit earlier be better?
People tend to be deep in sleep at this time. When a person has just fallen asleep, a bit of noise can wake him up. When living with my family at home, this is the best time to sneak downstairs for snacks. This is the wisdom I gained from my lifestyle.
I don’t want to criticize you anymore… Then, what are you carrying? What’s inside the sack?
I see… Assistant-kun, this bubble wrap is available in Japan, right? The one you pinch for fun…? Say, can I–
No, you can’t pinch it. It’s very troublesome to make. Let’s hurry.
I’ve been wondering about it for some time. Big Boss, you’re a goddess too. Don’t you have night vision like Aqua?
This body’s merely a disguise for use in the mortal world. Because I didn’t descend directly into the mortal world, I can’t sense devils, undead, and evil. But by the same token, I won’t emit divine aura that attracts undead.
Then, Big Boss, hold my hand. I’ll lead the way.
Assistant-kun, there’s no need to hold hands. When we infiltrated the palace, I could follow without any problem, remeber?
What are you saying? There was moonlight then, but there isn’t even starlight tonight. An accident here could be fatal. Don’t underestimate this place just because it’s easier to infiltrate than the palace. Come, give me your hand…
Satou Kazuma-san, you’ll receive divine retribution if you sexually harass me, okay? For example, the toilet will be occupied just when your stomach suddenly becomes uncomfortable. Then, when you finally manage to get in, you’ll find that there’s no more toilet paper.
I got carried away. Please forgive me.
Let’s just boldly enter today. There’s nobody around anyway. We easily  can do it with the Trap Detection skill and Lockpicking skill. The important issue is after we find the armor. I don’t know how effective the bubble wrap is in reducing the noise…
I’ll put my trust in Assistant-kun’s creation. In the worst case scenario, we can break through like we did in the royal palace!
By the way, Assistant-kun’s mask is really cool. You said you bought it from the magic tool shop in this city, right? I’m also quite interested in that masked doll on the sofa in your mansion. After our work’s done, bring me to visit that shop.
No problem… But, Big Boss, won’t you argue with the shop assistant? The shop assistant there has a bad relationship with Aqua. They argue every time they meet.
I won’t argue. Senpai’s always like that. She argues with everyone…
Okay, it’s open. Let’s go, Assistant-kun.
Big Boss. Can you not stop every time we find some treasure? Let’s get the divine relic and go home to sleep.
Ugh. Yes, I understand. But how should I put this? Whenever I see treasure, my thief’s blood begins to boil… When I consider that an item like this can help a lot of poor children, my hand just…
Can you please be the chivalrous thief when I’m not around? Besides, there’s definitely more expensive and less bulky items in the vault.
That’s true. Assistant-kun, you’re quite familiar with the art of theft… You gained quite a few levels, so you must be near the point where you can change jobs, right? Change jobs to be a thief!
My next goal is to live a decadent life, so it’s better to be an adventurer who’s weak but capable of learning different skills. Next, I want to learn the Create Earth Golem skill. I’m wondering if I could use that skill to create a golem to do housework.
… You sure like to waste magic and skill points on weird things. Speaking as a goddess, I wish you’d learn some proper skills to prepare to fight the Demon King…
There seems to be a trap here. Let me see… Oh. It’s an alarm trap… Say, Assistant-kun.
I’m not stupid. I won’t repeat the same mistake I made in the palace… R-Really. Don’t look at me like that…
…?
Okay, trap disarmed! The lock’s also been opened, Assistant-kun!
Ah. W-Wait, Big Boss. There’s–
…? What is it, Assistant-kun?
Eh?
Assistant-kun! Assistant-kun, look! This is a very expensive item!
Hey, Big Boss, that’s cheating. I saw that first!
I’ll say it right now. The treasure we steal must be donated away, okay? Even if the other party’s evil, we shouldn’t steal for our own gain…
Shh. What’s this super shiny thing? It seems to be worth a good price! Oh, what’s this strangely shaped stone? I remember Aqua’s collecting strange stones. Let’s bring it back as a present for her.
… Say, Assistant-kun, are you listening? We can’t do that. We really can’t keep them, okay?
Big Boss, I don’t see anything like a divine relic.
Eh? Uh, that’s true. But there’s a sense of a divine relic. Why isn’t it here?
Hmm?
A secret door. Not bad, Assistant-kun.
After all, I’m confident that my luck is second only to Big Boss’s luck.
This is…
This is the Sacred Armor Aigis… The toughest divine relic in this world that will bring its wearer victory.
Upon closer inspection, there are scratches everywhere.
… Yes. After all, this is the armor that protected its master against the Demon King’s army. No matter what challenge the armor’s master faced, he never lost to anyone. Right up til the end…
You were dedicated until your master died of sickness…
Hey, boy. Don’t touch me casually.
Uh. B-Boy? Is that me? No, what’s happening? The voice earlier was you? Sacred Armor Aigis?
Oh. What? Not a boy? Then you may touch some more. Let me introduce myself. Pleased to meet you two. My name’s Sacred Armor Aigis. I’m a multi-talented divine relic that can speak and sing. You may call me Aigis-san.
Uh… I’m a bit shocked since I’ve never heard that the divine relic could speak. Therefore, Aigis–
I told you to call me Aigis-san, brat.
I’m not a brat! And why’s a divine relic being so arrogant?
Big Boss. We didn’t sneak in here during the middle of the night to argue with an inorganic entity! Let’s complete our objective!
… Right. Aigis-san. We came here to borrow your power once more. I’ll help you find a new master. That person will come from another world like your previous master. It’ll be someone from a place called Japan, a person destined to save the world!
Ah? What are you saying? Why must I do such things even now? Impossible. I’m not willing. Borrowing my power means I have to be an armor to protect the master, right? Are you stupid? Even an armor can feel pain when hit. My cool, shiny body will be damaged! By the way, what’s that so-called master like? Is it someone I can accept?
… Uh, although I can’t promise it, the person should be full of righteousness and courage, and very gentle…
No, no. The personality doesn’t matter! The important thing is appearance. Appearance! Big tits? Or thin models? If it’s like that previous brat, then forget it. Ah. I prefer cuties to beauties. The previous master was a swordsman, so a swordswoman would be better this time. I hope that person will wear less beneath the armor.
I say, is this tasteless armor really that important? I think it’s better to let it sink to the bottom of the sea.
Assistant-kun, I understand your feelings, but this is a divine relic. Yes, I can understand your feelings, but please bear with it.
Hmm? Hey, what’s that guy doing? … By the way, who are you people? Did you mention ‘sneak in here during the middle of the night’ earlier?
Yes. We’re infiltrators. We’re going to bring you back and hand you over to the master. You’re a divine relic, a sacred armor, right? Then work hard for me.
There aren’t many girls sent here from Japan, so it may be hard to meet your requirements. But if a girl comes along, I’ll make you a priority for her…
Mansnatchers–!!
You’re not even human!
Good morning! Hey Kazuma! Good morning, wake up!
What do you want so early in the morning? I didn’t sleep last night, so I was just about to sleep! Keep the noise down!
What? Kazuma didn’t sleep? I know why Kazuma didn’t sleep last night.
Kazuma must be too excited to sleep because of the preparatory work for the festival, right? Don’t worry. This is nothing shameful. It’s a festival after all!
The preparation for the festival can wait until the afternoon. Why are we going in the morning…?
What are you saying, Kazuma? We’re adventurers, so we’re going to hunt monsters!
Didn’t you say you wanted to prepare for the festival?
This is the preparation.
Darkness and Megumin are ready! Come, Kazuma, quickly! Or we’ll be late!
… What’s going on? I’ve never seen so many people this early in the morning.
Anyone who wants to hunt the Lesser Wyverns that nest in the mountains, please come here! We need thieves that can use the Bind skill and archers that can attack flying enemies! The enemies are strong, so naturally the reward is good! There are six more slots!
There are a lot of bug monsters in the forest! Because of the large quantity, we need a lot of people. It’s a large scale expedition involving dozens of people! No limit on job and level!
A lot of herbivorous monsters appeared in the plains! If they’re left alone, large predators will come to feast on them, so we must exterminate them early. The guild’s currently providing free support supplies! The hunt rewards are also higher than usual! Please join us and make a profit!
Hey, what’s going on?
If we don’t clear the monsters nearby, the festival can’t go on peacefully, so everyone’s putting in the effort. Unlike the strong monsters that appeared in the winter, weak monsters are most active in the summer. The hunt rewards are also the highest in this season, so it’s a good time to make money for adventurers.
Hey, you guys are here too? Forget penniless Dust, why are the rest so enthusiastic? You people should still have some money, right?
I thought Kazuma would want join the large scale expeditions.
Yeah. You’re a regular patron of that shop, so it’s a little strange. In this season, male adventurers will leave other matters behind to join large scale expeditions.
What? You guys are this enthusiastic about the festival?
Festival? Well, the female adventurers are indeed hunting monsters to let the festival happen smoothly. After all, many of the female adventurers are Eris cultists. But we’ve got other reasons. The men here want to join the forest monster hunt.
Everyone, the forest monster hunt is a huge responsibility, so please do your best! It’s up to you whether we can live peacefully during the festival this year! Please eliminate the over-populated monsters…!
… Uh, what has living peacefully in the summer got to do with hunting monsters?
? Obviously,  it’s because there are too many monsters, so the citizens can’t work in the nearby forest.
No. I know that, but this problem isn’t only limited to the forest, right?
It’s the cicadas.
Yes. If there are too many monsters in the forest, the cicada catchers can’t do their work. If the catchers stop, the cicadas will fly into the city. We’ll be hosting the festival just as they arrive in this cityl.
So what? Aren’t cicadas the symbol of summer? They stay in the soil for a long time and emerge in summer to end their short lives in songs. Don’t do such unreasonable things just because it’s a bit noisy. That’s human arrogance and I don’t like it… So I’m leaving the cicadas alone. I’ll go home and sleep.
I forgot, Kazuma isn’t familiar with this country’s common knowledge. Listen, Kazuma. This country’s cicadas are more aggressive than normal. Japanese cicadas live for about one week, but the cicadas here, being full of life and magic power, live for about a month.
You just wanted an explanation of the negative aspects of cicadas, right? For example, it may pee while flying about, making the place stink. Cicadas have to pee anyway. And you said its lifespan is just one month? Leave it alone.
Are you serious?
I say, Kazuma. There are two main differences between the Japanese cicadas and the cicadas here. Firstly, the cicadas’ songs are very loud. Probably a few times louder than the Japanese cicadas.
And… The cicadas sing without stopping, even at night.
Then, frontline fighters who are confident in their defenses, please apply this oil to attract monsters. Everyone, listen. Although the enemies are weak and small insects, the quantity is staggering, so don’t be reckless!
As the acting lord, I’ll attract all the monsters! That’s right. It’s my duty to protect the citizens! Give me all the oil!
No. We only want to attract monsters. If you apply too much, not just the monsters, even other creatures will attack you.
I-I hope so!
Hey pervert, don’t make trouble for the guild staff! You just need to defend our party members!
Ah! The monsters are very enthusiastic in the summer! Please Kazuma, the request of my life…!
… Hey you… Didn’t you hear what the staff just said…?
Ha. You usually say that I’m useless, so now’s the time I prove my worth. A Crusader is a meat shield, so let me take on everything. You seem exceptionally motivated today, so do your part without reservation, and leave the defense to me.!
Of course. This is to let everyone in the city sleep well. I’ll exterminate the evil monsters and the cicadas. I’m different today. Watch closely!
Both of you are very excited, but I’ll be the one who kills the most number of monsters. Kazuma, please watch me!
…? What is it? Why are you looking at me?
Eh? …Uh, nothing. I thought you’d be the first to get carried away and cause all kinds of trouble.
You. What do you take me for? I can learn too. You people who get carried away will definitely fall during the fight… My vast wisdom has seen through it all– Pride precedes a fall.
?
? W-What? Hey. Why are you crying, Kazuma?
Adventurers! The first wave of monsters is coming! A vast amount of insecticide has been prepared here. It’s up to you, everyone!
Ugh! Wait…! There are too many. Some support please!
Wah!
Ah, it hurts! Damn. It’s shallow, but my belly’s been pierced! Be careful! Weaker armors will be ruined!
Ugh…? … Oh. Healing magic!
Twenty! I can take on twenty of them! Come on! Bring them on!
Is it not time yet? Kazuma, is it still not time for my grand entrance?
Sorry, you shouldn’t take action this time. After all, this is a forest. If you use magic, the surrounding trees will be destroyed, so you should rest today–
Explosion–!!
I leveled.
Idiot!
Why did you do this even after I said no? Look at this tragedy! You better apologize to everyone!
This is because Kazuma said I won’t get a chance to act! Besides, every adventurer in this city’s already used to Explosion magic. There’s no problem!
… What’s going on? My body feels itchy.
Hey, you…! Your armor! Ants are swarming over it!
Ah…! Wait Kazuma, please! It itches! They’ve gotten inside the armor! Create some water for me…!
Everyone, well done. Then, the second wave should be arriving soon…
… This isn’t good.
Wah! Kazuma! I’ve got a bad premonition!
Retreat! Retreat!
– Ugh… Boohoo… I worked hard this time… Even though I didn’t get carried away and worked really hard…
Ugh… Grrr… Ha… Ha… Kazuma… K-Kazuma… This is a new feeling… This feeling’s really refreshing…
– As a means to increase sales of various stalls, I suggest every stall should make their poster girls wear swimsuits!!
This idea is great! It’s great, but, if it gets carried away, the police will intervene, right?
How can anyone enjoy the festival with the fear of police intervention? The advisor’s suggestion will definitely increase sales! What kind of merchant wouldn’t do it when he knows it’ll be profitable?!
No. The chairman’s concern’s reasonable. If we focus only on the present profit, we may lose the profits of the festivals in the future… Damn. If only there was a proper excuse for poster girls to wear swimsuits…
I’ve got a plan.
What?
Advisor, what’s this plan?
This year’s festival name includes ‘Goddess Aqua Thanksgiving’. That’s right. The festival banner includes the name of the goddess of water.
Since it’s the festival of the goddess of water, let the poster girls wear swimsuits to play at water fights. It won’t be a problem if we say, ‘This costume is appropriate for playing with water!’ And besides, the festival’s held during the hottest time of the year. Then, this can be a way to prevent heat stroke. If the police intervene, we can counter with, ‘If someone collapses because of heat stroke, will you take responsibility?’ The police aren’t used to handling ‘responsibility’ so they’ll shut up.
Genius! Advisor, you’re practically a genius!
Please help out my shop after the festival!
– Hey Kazuma. The festival committee submitted a ‘Heat Stroke Prevention and Goddess Aqua Thanksgiving Festival Summary’. You’re a committee member, right? Then this…
Yes. Because the day of the festival will be very hot. To prevent heat stroke, we decided to host water fight events everywhere. Thus, the usual clothes worn by the poster girls will be inappropriate. If they get wet from the water fights, their underwear will be exposed. Swimsuits will allow for them to play without reservations. Because I didn’t have the opportunity to participate in such festivals in my country, I want to let this festival be successful…
I-Is that so? Sorry, I misunderstood. In that case, it’s fine. I agree. The first summer festival we spend together must be successful.
Detonation magic users have gone to the capital as reinforcements against the Demon King’s army. Thus, there isn’t enough firepower for this year’s fireworks display. I’m afraid we have to cancel it.
Idiot! We can’t cancel the fireworks display. What are you thinking? Aren’t fireworks always accompanied by people in yukatas? What’s the point of the festival if you don’t get to see people in yukatas?
Advisor, please calm down! Are ‘yukatas’ referring to that clothing from a faraway country?
Isn’t it just a fireworks display and yukatas? What’s the big deal?
I understand our advisor’s full of anticipation for yukatas. I heard that it’s indeed conventional to wear a yukata during a fireworks display. But if there is no Detonation magic user, what can we do? I don’t know if we can find a Blast magic user…
Everyone should know how pathetic the fireworks are when made with Fireball magic…
I’ve got a plan. One of my companions can use Explosion magic–
Rejected! The festival itself will be destroyed!
I want to retract what I said earlier about you being a genius! You’re an idiot!
We shouldn’t have let this man be our advisor. We must’ve been possessed…
What are you saying, you fool? You should resign as the chairman! Firework displays are romantic! It’s a necessary event for the summer! You get to watch fireworks with girls in yukatas! And nonchalantly hold their hands! There’s no point to the event if there are no fireworks!
You damn brat! In that case, you provide a plausible suggestion! Ah, what’s with your hand? Is it really okay for an adventurer to use violence against a commoner?
Kill him! This upstart adventurer isn’t capable! Everyone gang up on him!
– ‘Detonation Magic Potion Permit Application’…? Hey Kazuma. Why do you need this thing? Isn’t it dangerous? And… Why are you hurt all over?
This magic potion is necessary for the festival. I’m shouldering everyone’s will to not let this festival fail.
Uh, hmm. You look so serious. I guess it must be true, I understand. Permit granted. Still– Why are you hurt?
A man has things that he must protect at all costs. These wounds are my proof of manhood in protecting what must absolutely be protected.
I-Is that so? I understand, I won’t ask further. I feel it’s better not to do so.
In my country, there’s a place called Asakusa. Every year, the festival in Asakusa includes a Samba carnival which parades sensuous women on the streets…
Stop lying. What kind of festival is that? You just made it up! You’re just a horny brat!
Previously, you mentioned a festival whereby women sit on huge phallic objects that are carried around like sedan chairs! Such ridiculous festivals are impossible!
Everything I said is true! Don’t treat me as if I’m crying wolf! Anyway, the Eris Festival’s too rustic! What’s with everyone going to the Eris Church to offer prayers? Isn’t there anything else to do? For example, having both sides carry their mikoshi and oppose each other.
A festival’s sacred by nature. The kinds of festivals in your mind are ridiculous!
Making money is important, but if we do that, it feels like something important will be lost!
Your suggestions are too blunt! It’s not that there can’t be erotic elements, but can’t they be a bit subtler?
– Hey Kazuma. Can I have a moment of your time?
What is it?
I completely can’t understand the purpose of this ‘costume parade’.
Goddess Eris will descend into this world in disguise and act on her own. Have you heard of this legend?
Oh, yes… This is a popular legend among Eris cultists. Thus, every year at this time, a lot of people in the city will dress up as Eris-sama so she can enjoy the festival in her true form. When the real thing’s mixed up with the fakes, Eris-sama won’t be so noticeable.
This event is to accommodate with the tradition you mentioned. It’s not restricted to dressing up as Eris-sama. One can dress up as a hero, a princess, or Goddess Aqua. In my country, there’s a festival called Comiket, which features all kinds of costumes.
I-Is it? Uh, I think I understand the purpose of this event. But… But this is a festival to praise the goddesses, so… Isn’t the permit to dress up as a succubus inappropriate…
What are you saying? This is a rare festival. It’s not just the goddesses who want to relax in their true forms. Don’t worry, just make an exception for this festival. It’s just a few sensuous onee-sans walking the streets, it won’t hurt.
Even if you say so… Uh? Wait. What did you just say? The way you said it sounds like there will be non-divine entities infiltrating the city…
Fine, fine. Don’t worry. Just stamp the seal! This is the dream of all male adventurers! And the onee-sans agreed that if this proposal is approved, they’ll be willing to really dress up as succubi!
Who are these ‘onee-sans’ you mentioned? By the way, why are you so persistent? I get it, I get it! To think that there are women who want to dress up like that. Who are these people…?
Citizens of Axel, are you ready for this long-awaited day? I officially announce the start of the Goddess Eris & Goddess Aqua Thanksgiving Festival!
Whoa!!
It’s already morning…
Good morning, Kazuma. Everyone got up early today, including Aqua and Darkness.
No, I didn’t get up early. I was playing games all night. By the way, those two are up? I don’t see them. Where’d they go?
Aqua was too excited to sleep last night, so she went out at dawn.
After I told Darkness that Aqua was gone, Darkness rushed out as well, saying she wants to keep an eye on Axis Cult so they won’t do anything stupid.
That girl sure is busy after becoming the temporary lord. Megumin, are you going to the festival?
No. I intend to visit Yunyun, who’s probably about to cry over the fact that she has nobody to go to the festival with. I’ll walk around before her, but I won’t invite her along, so I can mess with her feelings. Kazuma, want to come along?
Y-You’re… Just go with her to the festival. I’ll take a short nap until evening, then I’ll visit the festive stalls.
I don’t think that can be considered a short nap anymore… By the way, Kazuma, are you free on the third night of the festival?
The third day? I’ll probably be roaming around, visiting the stalls or something. Why?
Nothing. There’s a fireworks display on the third day. Since the festival’s held in conjunction with Axis cultists, I’m not sure if we can get to the third day safely. Then again, I can’t be sure that there’ll definitely be an accident… If it’s all good, do you want to watch the fireworks with me?
You can’t sell these things without a permit! Why do you Axis cultists always make trouble?
What do you mean by ‘these things’? This is the stall carefully planned by Aqua-sama. How dare you insult it!
Hey, what are you doing? I asked you people to get enthusiastic, not to get into an argument! You make trouble for the police the moment I take my eyes off you. Must you people always be like that?
Oh, good! Listen, Kazuma-san. This guy’s picking on us to disrupt our business!
I’m not picking on anyone! It’s simply not permitted for you to sell these things!
… What the hell is this?
Aqua-sama said that there should be goldfish scooping in a festival. I’m not familiar with goldfish scooping, but I still did my best to recreate the scene. Since it’s difficult to find wild goldfish, I used tadpoles as a substitute…
Hey, aren’t these tadpoles a bit too big? Are these really tadpoles?
In any case, it’s forbidden to sell the young of Giant Frogs in this place! These things will grow huge in a very short time! If the kids buy them, the city will be covered in Giant Frogs in a few months! How will you compensate for that?
Hey, spray some pesticide in here, quickly.
Stop! Don’t ruin my shop! Aqua-sama said that Kazuma-san would feel nostalgic and be very happy! You should like goldfish scooping, right?!
Yes, I like scooping goldfish! But who’d want to scoop these unlovable things? Casually releasing them will cause trouble. If you don’t want them killed, take them far away! You people said I could leave it to you once the permit is granted. Now look at this!
Did you think there’s only one stall that the Axis Cult can be proud of? For this festival, all the Axis cultists in the city gathered and thought of many creative things!
A string of roasted kraken! This is made from a young kraken. Rare and special roasted kraken! Very delicious!
Hey, isn’t this just an ordinary squid? It’s no different from the taste of a squid…
What are you saying? Have you eaten a real kraken before? The Axis Cult can guarantee that this is definitely a roasted kraken!
Come and visit the Amazing Hut! Currently exhibiting the rare hybrid offspring of a fish-man and a mermaid! Caught by brave Axis cultists… Ah! Customer, please don’t get crazy in the hut!
This is nonsense! Return my money, bastard! That’s is just a big fish inside a tank!
I’ve said already. This is the hybrid offspring of a fish-man and a mermaid!
Come and play the shooting game! There’s a grand prize for anyone who can hit the target between the eyes…
Hey, the shooting target looks like Eris-sama! Stop this blasphemy against Eris-sama!
Ugh. Eris cultists attempt to disrupt us on the first day of the festival! Police! Over here! Arrest those Eris cultists… Ah, what are you doing? I didn’t ask you over to close my shop. I want you to arrest those Eris cultists…!
Onee-san, is that a real dragon?
Yes. Of course, it’s a dragon. The Axis Cult’s currently operating dragon-rearing ranches. One for only 500 eris. Come, buy one.
Eh… 500 eris’s all of my pocket money. If I buy it, I won’t be able to buy other things. No thanks. Anyway, it looks like a lizard…
Is it? How regrettable. But if it’s like this, these children won’t be sold. Of course, unsold dragons can’t simply be released into the wild. They’re dangerous, after all. I can only send them to animal shelters… But if they can’t find owners there, they’ll eventually be put to death…
W-Why’s it like that? Th-This is a lizard, right? Just releasing it will be fine.
What are you saying? This is a trueborn dragon! Hey, are you buying? Is it really okay not to buy it?
Ugh… B-But if I buy it, my pocket money will…
So you’re not buying? Then you’ll definitely regret it! These poor dragons are destined to be sent to the animal shelters!
If you keep fooling around, I’ll send your chick to the animal shelter! How can you bully a little kid, you fool!
Because you were scammed into buying the so-called dragon egg, you intend to mass produce similar victims to take revenge on society?
What are you saying, Kazuma? Don’t you know? In the special situation of a festival, a certain amount of profiteering is acceptable! Aren’t Japanese festivals like this? And Emperor Zell’s a real dragon!
This isn’t an ‘acceptable amount’ anymore, you fool! Look. Your area’s not lively at all, and the customers are losing patience with all of you! Darkness said she’ll be coming for inspection. If that rock-headed person sees this tragedy, she won’t permit the Axis Cult to host a festival ever again.
Th-There! Kazuma, there’s a popular stall there! There are definitely no tricks and it’s the most profitable stall!
I saw Chris idly strolling around, so I grabbed her to man the stall!
Hey, again! Please, once more!
Wait, let me go first! I’ve spent a lot of money here already!
Damn. Lost again! Hey, show me the other two lots!!
You win
Fine. I’ll win this time! Since I don’t see any cheats, I should win soon!
I don’t sense any trace of blessing magic, so why do we always lose…? Hey, stop playing.
Once more! It’s fine if I don’t recover my losses. I’ll be satisfied if I win once! I won’t accept this pathetic record of not winning even once!
Okay. Just this time! Goddess of luck, Eris-sama! Please let me win! Or I’ll convert to the Axis Cult!
Eh? Hey. W-Wait!
All on this one lot! … Damn it!! I hate Eris-sama the most!
D-Don’t!
Well done, Chris. It was worth the effort to beg and coerce you into helping! You didn’t just man the stall, you even converted an Eris cultist! Previously, I found a strangely shaped stone from the Kowloon Hydra’s lake. I’ll give it to you as a present.
I don’t want it! Ugh… My precious worshipper…
Aqua-sama, what should we do…? Now that the obsessed customers have left, even the lottery stall… We can only use the tokoroten slime stall recommended by me.
Hey, stop selling weird stuff! I’ll think of something for you people.
Cheers!
– Hey, Kazuma. What should I do?
This is the time for your Party Tricks. After attracting customers, you can help out. Cecily will attend to the customers. Chris can help me with the cooking.
Oh. I just need to attract customers? Leave it to me!
I just need to use my charms to receive the male customers? Leave it to me!
Hey, why am I still helping out?
Okay, next! More mayonnaise and seaweed, right? Hey! Aqua, cut more cabbages! I’ll leave the pork to you, Chris!
Hey Kazuma. Let me cut the pork! Today’s cabbages are too lively and aggressive!
I’m not good at handling cabbages either! Assistant-kun, let me do your job. You cut the cabbages!
It can’t be helped then. Chris, check out my vegetable-cutting skill! … Oh. The cabbages are especially crispy in summer. They’re most tasty.
Uh… Yes. I like summer cabbages the best. Winter cabbages are too violent. Autumn cabbages can fly, so they’re very difficult to deal with…
Both of you are supposed to be working. Why are you eating? This customer has waited for a long time! Big bowl of noodles with extra pork slices!
This yakisoba thing’s really delicious! The sauce’s awesome!
Yes. I feel hungry just smelling it!
Bro, one big bowl of noodles with mayonnaise and cabbage!
Thanks for your patronage. I have your order! Hey, Cecily. Record the order… Stop eating the cabbages!
I didn’t expect someone with the cooking skill to open shop here. This year’s festival’s really sumptuous! Looks like we can let Axis cultists join in the festival next year as well!
Isn’t that chef the famous adventurer, Satou Kazuma? That guy can even cook?
Hey Kazuma. Axis cultists are being praised! This is something new to me!
Should we add tokoroten slime as an after-meal dessert? Sweet and soft Tokoroten Slime!
Hey, don’t add weird illegal items like tokoroten slime! Ha. How is it, Aqua? If you’re serious about doing business, you can make a profit! No need for tricks. Just doing it honestly is the best! … Still, look at this popularity. Maybe I should actually open a restaurant. Oh, my. Although I already made enough money for my entire lifetime, seeing this scene still makes me laugh happily!
Hey, Assistant-kun… It seems that even the customers from the stalls managed by Eris cultists are coming over. What am I doing…?
– Then, this is today’s sales record.
Whoa!?
It’s almost twice as much as the previous year! This year’s festival is a big success!
It’s all thanks to our advisor’s suggestion to let the Eris Church and the Axis Cult compete with each other! Although the sales in Axis Cult’s area aren’t that good, it motivated Eris cultists to be more enthusiastic.
Yes. I hope the Axis Cult can do better, but this isn’t bad. The Axis Cult’s stall selling yakisoba is very popular. I heard it was opened late just when the festival was closing. Tomorrow, it should open earlier, so it’s worth the anticipation.
Actually, it was because the Axis Cult was too useless, so I had to open a noodle stall selling my country’s food. I’ll work hard as the advisor tomorrow. I still have a lot of good ideas.
Oh!
That’s our Satou-san. I heard you were involved in the incident that made a lot of money for Wiz’s Magic Tool Shop. It seems that isn’t just a rumor!
Yes. No wonder you got so rich in such a short time!
It looks we can look forward to the next two days!
Leave it to me! Satou Kazuma will work hard tomorrow!
Oh!!
… Uh, Kazuma. Do you still intend to help the Axis Cult?
Yes, I do… What’s up with you? You look pale.
Of course. I didn’t think that lordship duties would be so tiring… The complaints for these two days were a lot more than those during the festival preparatory period. An idiot dumped the young of Giant Frogs into the Kowloon Hydra’s lake. What was she thinking…? And the scam of the Amazing Hut. And customers being groped in the haunted house by Axis cultists disguised as zombies…
And Axis cultists infiltrated into the Eris Church’s stalls and loudly demanded protection money. Male shopkeepers wearing swimming trunks. And the incident involving painting colors on a lizard to sell to children…!
Thanks… I feel that I’ve aged a lot in these few days…
How unlucky… But remember this feel. I felt the same way every time I had to listen to the willful demands of you all. Uh, although most of the complaints last night seemed to involve me somewhat, I don’t think there should be too many more complaints. So hang in there.
Th-Thank you…! You’re the only one who can understand me…! Now that I think about it, I’ve caused you a lot of trouble, really a lot… Uh, wait. Your latter sentences…
Welcome! This way for a certain country’s festive food, yakisoba!
Roasted octopus caught from the forest! These octopi pieces are chewy and tasty!
Have some shaved ice! Tasty shaved ice! There’re strawberry, lemon, pineapple, red bean, and tokoroten slime flavors!
Ah. Kazuma, why are you so late? Look. This is prosperous! The shaved ice you made in the afternoon ran out! I’ll create water, so hurry and turn them to ice!
The condition’s not bad today. Yes. If you work hard honestly like this, your worshippers will definitely increase. Isn’t it nice that everyone can be happy?
Yes. This is all thanks to you. Look, Kazuma. The children of the Axis Cult are smiling so happily.
Kazuma, Kazuma. I feel that hosting this festival is great. Thank you for helping the Axis Cult.
Pride goes before a fall
my kid
By the way, since these stalls are popular, you must have earned a lot? It’s a rare opportunity. Use the earnings to rebuild that dilapidated Axis Cult Church.
We didn’t earn much. Yesterday you said, ‘If you’re serious about doing business, you can make a profit! No need for tricks. Just doing it honestly is the best!’. I obeyed and implemented a low profit, high sales approach. This festival is co-hosted, so the festival committee is making the Axis Cult pay for the cost of operation. If you include this cost, we’re still losing money.
… Is it? But as the sales increase, you should stop losing money soon! After all, this is unprecedented! I’m surprised that the impoverished Axis Cult could afford the cost of operation!
I paid for it myself. I received the reward for the previous Kowloon Hydra hunt. That reward money plus my usual savings managed to pay for it. I wanted to build a beautiful dragon nest for Emperor Zell, but I guess we’ll just have to make do.
… I-Is that so?
What happened? If you’re unwell, I can heal you. After all, you’ve worked really hard lately. Okay, don’t move. I’ll give you an extra powerful one.
Oh. We’ve been waiting for you, Advisor-dono!
Come, Advisor-dono. Take a seat!
Good evening, regular patron-san! We heard a lot about your miracles from the committee members~
Thank you for your frequent patronage, customer! I heard we owe it to you for the succubus cosplay being permitted in this festival!
It seems you know them too. They operate a small restaurant in this city. This time, they wore swimsuits to serve as the poster girls of various shops. They say they want to reward the advisor who acquired the permit for this costume…
Since we’re having a festival, let’s drink and keep you company. Hehe. We won’t let you go back tonight. We must let regular patron-san enjoy himself!
Then, cheers to our consultant’s activeness and sales! Come, Advisor-dono. Please give us a cheer!
Let’s achieve happiness by making a lot of money! Cheers!
Cheers!
… Never mind about coming back at dawn– What are you doing at this time? Hey. We’ve got a date to watch the fireworks today. Quickly, change your clothes!
Ugh. Squeezing in the crowd in this condition… There will be all kinds of things coming out…
This man is really weak! Normally, if a guy has a date with a girl to watch the fireworks, he should control how much he drinks. What were you doing last night? You were in high spirits when you came back.
Ask for Darkness… Tell her to use her authority to postpone the fireworks event to tomorrow…
It’s great that you don’t want to break your promise, but if you say such willful things, Darkness will go crazy. Aqua and her people really ran her ragged today, after all.
Whoa? Hey, wait. What are you doing? Why are you suddenly undressing me? One of these days you’ll do something unexpected and give me a shock!
I won’t be fazed by Kazuma’s nakedness. I’ve already seen you with your clothes dissolved in that fight with the Kowloon Hydra. Come, If you won’t undress yourself, I’ll do it for you.
… I-I honestly didn’t think you’d change your clothes right in front of me.
Didn’t you say that you won’t be fazed by my nakedness? … Phew. I feel better after drinking some water. Anyway, you mentioned that Aqua and her people ran Darkness rugged. What did they do this time?
The evaluation for the Axis Cult’s stalls were fairly good last night. Their sales weren’t bad when compared to the Eris Church. As a result, the Axis cultists got cocky. Basically, since the sales of the Axis Cult was better than that of the Eris Church, they willfully demanded more space for setting up stalls.
… I’ve got a bad premonition, but let’s leave it to Darkness. Yes. Let’s avoid the area managed by the Axis Cult today. Let’s watch the fireworks.
Yes. Since it’s summer and a festival, we should avoid trouble once in a while. Do something like a date.
– Yes. I knew it’d be like this.
Why are you stopping suddenly? Come. Let’s go.
This is my first time going to a festival with someone and watching the fireworks display! Hey Megumin. Is there anything wrong with me now? I really, thoroughly prepared for it!
Other than your excitement, there’s nothing wrong. Please don’t panic just because it’s a festival.
It’s too early to be alone by ourselves now. After the fireworks display, let’s go back together.
I’ve always stayed at home during every festival in the past. I didn’t expect I’d participate in a festival like this. It’s great that I left the Crimson Demon Village! … Kazuma-san, are you okay? You look a bit strange…
Whoa! N-N-Nothing. I’m very excited to participate in the festival too! By the way, Yunyun, festivals are when you can unexpectedly meet your friends. You stayed home on those days? Never mind. As a high level hikikomori, I can understand your feelings. I didn’t want to come out when there were festivals and crowds. Yes. Actually, this is quite normal.
I’m not a hikikomori like Kazuma-san. Whenever I went to a festival alone, I’d meet some classmates playing together– Perhaps they were taking care of my feelings–and they would say, ‘Sorry, we didn’t invite you along’ and similar apologies…
I understand, stop talking! It’s my fault. Please don’t continue! I’ll play with you today!
… How should I say this? Kazuma should learn to have some mercy.
Yes. Both the onee-san at the shooting game stall and the uncle at the lottery stall cried. They said they’d have to close their stalls today.
Listen. A festival’s a war with the stall owners. In my country, the top prizes for the lottery are often not won by anyone, even after the lottery’s sold out. And when you happily return home with a prize, you may find that it looks like an imitation product upon closer inspection.
I need to ask about your country in detail one day… Anyway, the festival this year’s much more joyous when compared to previous years. Is this the costume parade suggested by Kazuma? Everyone can walk about in their favorite costumes. There are even excessive succubus and incubus costumes. Real succubi may get attracted to this festival.
This is really another world…
What? Why do you have this look as if you’re banned from using Explosion magic?
… No. It’s nothing…
Kazuma, let’s go! If we don’t hurry up and join the fight, it’ll be too late!
… Join the fight? Uh, wait. Don’t drag me! Can’t we see the fireworks clearly here?
What are you saying? We’re adventurers! If we don’t join the defensive line, who’ll protect the festival?
Hey, explain this situation! What is it? Isn’t this the fireworks display? Where’s everyone rushing to?
It’s the insects!
Insects? What about insects? Aren’t there a lot of bonfires during the festival? Aren’t the insects attracted by the fire everywhere in any case?
Every year, in this season, the guild will request for insect extermination. Attracted by the festival’s bonfire at night, the active insects will fly toward the city from the nearby forest and plains. They will circle in the sky above the city, waiting for a chance to attack. Thus, the fireworks display was organized to cast Detonation magic and Blast magic into their midst.
I don’t know what fireworks are used for in Kazuma-san’s country… In this country, fireworks in the summer are declarations of war against the swarming insects.
Kazuma. There’s a light in your room. Are you asleep?
N-N-Not yet! I was about to sleep!
Is that so…? Sorry I came over late at night. May I have a moment of your time?
… I understand. Can you wait a bit? You can’t see me like this.
? I-I-I understand. Sorry to interrupt you.
Ha… Ha… S-Sorry for the wait…
Nothing. I didn’t wait long… Hey, are you naked? I won’t ask what you were doing earlier, but at least stop panting!!
Wait! I wasn’t doing anything indecent! Don’t misunderstand!!
I-I know! I won’t misunderstand, so put on your clothes! And if you’re doing that kind of thing, wash your hands before you sleep!
… Forget it– What’s the matter? Aqua will spread some weird rumors if she sees you hanging outside my room in that attire.
Uh… It isn’t convenient here. May I come in?
Why the sudden visit? Can’t it wait until tomorrow morning?
N-Nothing! It can wait until morning, but… Uh… Lately, everyone’s been busy, so we seldom meet even in the house, right?
Kazuma, you, uh… I only apologized to you. I haven’t thanked you yet… I was waiting for a chance to be alone with you to thank you properly…
Is this about the old man lord stealing you away? That was my own initiative, so no need for thanks. Didn’t you take on my debts on your own initiative? I didn’t thank you for that either.
From you… I gained a lot of happy, refreshing, sad, and angry memories. As the daughter of a noble family, I normally wouldn’t have such experiences. If I had never met you, I wouldn’t have been able to travel with everyone and experience those dangerous adventures. The past year after I met you has been the happiest and most blessed time of my life.
So I want to thank you. Not only because you saved me from the lord. When other people learned of my identity, they’d keep me at a distance, but you stayed with me even after you knew I was a noble. Thank you. I’m very happy living with you all in this mansion. It’s basically like… Yes. If my deceased mother whose face I don’t remember was still alive, I should’ve known this feeling…
So, let me thank you once more. For staying with me all this time. I sincerely thank you for rescuing me, even after I’d given up…
So tonight. Uh… As thanks…
No, no. Don’t mention it. When I was with Megumin, she thanked me for saving you as well. It’s nothing. After all, we’re so close!
… Seriously. Mentioning Megumin at this time; you just can’t read the mood.
By the way, I received a notice from the police. Megumin will be released later tonight. I’m rather despicable to come to you at this time…
This is what was promised. If we defeat the Kowloon Hydra, I’ll kiss you on the cheek… As for saving me from the lord, some other day…!
What is this? Wait, Darkness. You made the mood so hot just to kiss me on the cheek? Stop messing around! Both you and Megumin are alike! What do you want, making me so full of expectation? Retake! I want a retake! If you really want to do it, you can do it well. Bravely take that step!
Why are you always like this?! Give that sweet moment back to me!!
You’re way too late! What took you so long?
I’m really sorry. Something happened with Darkness. I didn’t expect her to run over to my room late at night while wearing something like that…
Eh?
Y-You’re doing it again. Randomly saying stuff to turn my anger away; it won’t be so easy. Even if you say it so meaningfully, basically nothing really happened, right?
Well, nothing much happened. Darkness merely kissed me suddenly.
Ha–?
There’s not much time left. Stop making that funny expression, let’s go. Maybe because of what happened earlier, I feel really good tonight.
Eh~? Hey, wait! Why are you so calm after being kissed? You’re lying, right? Hey! This is just unrequited love, right?
It’s true. Ask Darkness if you don’t believe me. ‘Did you visit Kazuma’s room late at night and suddenly kiss him?’ Still, what’s going on? Previously, Megumin also said she likes me and that we should go back together alone after the fireworks display– But she ruined it herself. Big boss, what should I do? Maybe I’ll step into adulthood during this festival.
Really? You also said this before, ‘Recently, my relationship with Megumin’s pretty good. Darkness seemed to be somewhat interested in me too!’. Uh. Wait. Isn’t this a love triangle?
Eh?… When did Darkness become so bold? Earlier, you said Megumin liked you too? What are you going to do? Who are you going to choose?
Hey, it’s too early to make such conclusions. I’m having a headache as well. The current situation is the routing stage often seen in Japanese novels. Right. All the girls like me and the harem’s being formed… But though those two girls look pretty enough, there’s some issues about their inner selves. Following this trend, I may raise flags for other girls too, so I think I should wait before making a decision. What do you think I should do?
I think you should go and die… But I’m really surprised. When did everyone start to…?
What should we do, Assistant-kun? This mansion isn’t as large as the palace. It’s hard to infiltrate when there are sentries.
Yes. What should we do? Isn’t there a way to distract them…?
Uh… Are the two of you the Silver-Haired Thieving Group?
P-P-Pleased to meet you! No. Actually, we met before! I met you in the palace once… I’m your fan, Megumin the Archwizard!
Wow. We’re really famous! After all, we have a bounty of 200 million eris on our heads!!
It’s so amazing that a band of thieves has such a high bounty! Oh, I’d like to ask… When the two of you snuck into the palace, was it really to protect the princess from a dangerous divine relic?!
Yes. That’s right. We’re the chivalrous thieves. Normally, we’re just commoners, but we couldn’t let an innocent girl be exposed to such dangers, even if she’s a princess. Whenever someone’s in trouble, we’ll break in to help, whether it’s a noble’s mansion or the royal palace. This is the Masked Thieving Group.
Wow…!
Wait, Assistant-kun. Isn’t it the Silver-Haired Thieving Group? It’s too opportunistic to change the name at this time. I’m the boss, right?
What are you saying, Big Boss? When we were in the palace, you said I could be the boss too. So it’s fine to name it the Masked Thieving Group!
Then, what are the two of you doing here? This is a noble’s home, right? … And his reputation isn’t that good…
You’re… Megumin, right? Actually, we’re after something hidden in this mansion. It’s necessary for the future of mankind. Stealing is not a praiseworthy deed, but… For us, there are some things which must be done even if we end up being regarded as criminals.
Wow…! Wow…!!
Yes. We’re going to steal from this house. This way, we’ll have something to decisively end the battle with the Demon King’s army. If you want report us, we won’t stop you… But please believe in us. It’s for the sake of mankind!
I believe! I believe in you! Of course, I won’t report you! … But I have a little request.
Please read this! This is a fan letter describing how cool and charismatic both of you are! In order to hand it to you personally, I’ve been carefully bringing it along everywhere I go!!
Thanks. After we’re done with our work, I’ll be sure to read it.
Big Boss, what are you doing? That letter was for me!
What are you saying? Megumin said it’s a fan letter to the Silver-Haired Thieving Group! It’s not yours, but ours. As the boss, naturally I should keep it!
Thanks for receiving it. There were supposed to be a lot of things to look forward to after the fireworks display tonight, but I messed it all up. I was somewhat depressed… But thanks to that, I can meet both of you. So, it wasn’t all unlucky.
Big Boss, it’s good that we didn’t expose our identities. But meeting her at this time, I don’t know if we’re lucky or unlucky.
With both of us here, there won’t be any unlucky event. We even got a fan letter.
Although I wish I could help out, I should probably return earlier to apologize to someone…
Big Boss, should I go back first tonight? If I go back now, I feel an event will happen with Megumin.
No way. In many ways, today’s the best day to infiltrate! Anyway, what kind of event will happen with Megumin? At least choose one between Darkness and Megumin!
… Big Boss, after our work, let’s decide who gets to keep that letter.
Fine. Let’s decide it with a game of rock-paper-scissors.
Don’t decide this with luck!
Let’s subdue the sentries. I feel good today; I can handle two people easily.
You were this excited too back when we infiltrated the palace… You get really lively at night. Are you a devil or something?
If that’s the case, then all the NEETs in Japan would be devils. Big Boss, use the Lurk skill so we can get close to them. It’s full moon tonight and the festival’s bonfires are still burning, so there’s a lot of light. Be careful.
This festival’s awesome. It’s unlike any festival before! This is all thanks to the participation of the Axis Cult. Making the poster girls wear swimsuits is a stroke of genius.
Same with allowing succubus cosplay. I found an amazing babe. This festival has just been amazing. But did you hear? Supposedly, there was some outside help in the management this time around.
The outside help was from that guy, right? Pitting the Eris Church and the Axis Cult against each other, then fanning the flames just so he can get a bigger commission out of it… What a bastard.
Oh, right. Bringing in the Axis cultists, allowing for succubus cosplay, making the poster girls wear swimsuits… I heard all of these suggestions were his. His name should be–
Double Drain Touch!
Hey, Assistant-kun. Don’t be reckless! Although surprises are good, they nearly raised the alarm just now!
I feel good today, so I’m confident I can handle them. I managed it in the end, right? No problem. Leave it to me.
Even if it ended well, you mustn’t be reckless. Most soldiers joined in the defense against the insect invasion. They were careless because they were tired. This won’t happen again.
I know. Let’s go then. I want to go back early to be affectionate with Megumin.
Weren’t you getting on well with Darkness earlier? I won’t care if you get killed as a result. I won’t agree to another resurrection if you die this way.
By the way, about the sentries’ conversation earlier… External support for the festival… Assistant-kun, do you know anything about it?
N-No…
I was wondering who it might be. It’s the previous thieves again! Haven’t you had enough? Thieves! Thieves–!!
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you still in the mood to do this? This is a noble’s mansion. You’ll be executed if you’re caught… Eh. The mansion’s too quiet. What happened?
Ha. Do you think we came unprepared? Your telepathy won’t be transmitted to the people in the mansion. Too bad!
What did you do? Hey, fine. I understand! Let’s make a deal!! You want my power, right? Then find a worthy master for me, and I’ll cooperate with you! I can compromise a bit regarding the master. Please!!
You should’ve said that when we first came! Idiot– Idiot– It’s been decided that your master will be a man, and it’s an uncle with big shiny muscles. Be prepared to serve your new master!!
Don’t speak nonsense, you bastard! Hey, stop! Think from the perspective of an armor! Please! You don’t want to be worn by a slovenly uncle, right? If you must protect someone, it’d be better to protect a cute girl, right?
I agree completely, but it’s your fault that we were so miserable. We won’t listen to your requests anymore, you great idiot!
A-Assistant-kun. I know I argued with it last time too, but arguing with an armor’s too childish…
Ah! No! No! Woman! I must be worn by a woman! A black-haired beauty, a blonde lolita or a sexy brunette. Right now, I’ll fine as long as it’s a woman! You know, my wearer would sweat a lot during combat. Consider my feelings about being drenched in a man’s sweat!
Give it up. Also, it’s useless to shout on the way. Chris’s sack can block weak magic. You’ll be wrapped in it while we take you back. Anyway, you’re an inorganic item, so why do you have so many demands? Stop being willful…
Ha!
A-Assistant-kun?! Hey? Why are you moving?
I’ve decided. I’ll go on a journey to find a pretty woman worthy of wearing me. Although it’s nice to be waxed daily by the maids in this mansion, people like you may show up again. I’ll find my own master.
Wait, Aigis! This world needs your power! If it’s okay, before your new master’s found, let me wear you…
Fuck! Where’s the fun in being worn by an androgynous thief? I said I’ll find my own master… Since you want to wear me so much, let’s evaluate our compatibility… Well, your face is A grade. Job compatibility is C grade. Breast size is below grading. I’m sorry, we’re not fated to be together…
Why you–! I was imploring you so nicely! Let’s use force then! Bind!
Oh. What are you doing with this wire? What? Do you want me to bind you up with this? Hehe. You look so pure, yet your taste’s so heavy!
Bind!
Didn’t you learn your lesson? Really, you still don’t understand? Who do you think I am? I’m the legendary Sacred Armor Aigis. I’m the toughest in this world. I’m immune to magic and skills and can heal my master. I’m the sacred armor that can sing and dance! I won’t lose to thieving brats like you!!
Big Boss. Even if skills are useless, it can’t be too powerful since it could be chained down! Let’s subdue it together!
I-I understand! I’ll go from the right. Assistant-kun, circle around it!
Hey, you still want to fight? My fist’s really a steel fist. That’s right, I’m a weapon incarnate!
What’s this fellow talking about? So noisy and annoying! It’s too talkative for a suit of armor! Ha!
Good. I caught it!
Boss. Take its arm off! Disassemble it and stuff it in the sack! Since it’s so talkative, leave the helmet behind in this room!
Hey, your line of thought is very dangerous. My body can’t be disassembled. When my master wore me, he used a keyword to do it. Instead of carrying me away, it’ll be easier to just wear me. The keyword to equip is ‘I want to be an armored girl!’ Come, say it once.
I-I want to be an armored g…
There can’t possibly be such a stupid keyword, Big boss. You’ve been tricked! Hey, th-this fellow’s much stronger than expected…
Big Boss! Not good! If it leaves the room, it can’t be silenced!
Oh. Hey, be obedient, Aigis! I’m Eris. The goddess in charge of this world, Eris! I have an obligation to manage you. Come obediently with me!
You’re really trying hard… What a waste. Your face’s cute, but one must still consider the inner self. While searching for a master, I must be more mindful.
What did you say–?
Then, we’re parting ways. If you want me so much, learn to be charming enough to keep a man first, little girl. The most essential point is breast size. Some people say that flat-chest’s a novelty, but I think that’s just a bluff by people who don’t have the stuffs.
Eh–?
Everyone in Undine’s household who can’t keep me, a world class treasure. You’ve taken care of me so far! Please forgive me for leaving on my own to find a master. If you want me, prepare a world class beauty! I’ll come back in that case!
Ah! I’m free! Yes, now I’m totally free! The sky’s the limit! Aigis Kick!!
What? The thieves are back again?
That was Aigis’s voice just now! Check the treasure vault!
Big Boss, this is bad. This is the third floor; we’ve got no escape route. We’ll secure your wire to that pillar and go down from there!
Hey, you’ve got a wire at your waist too. Use yours!
My wire’s an expensive, custom-made special item! They’ll track me down if they investigate it!
Is that why you hurriedly picked it up after it failed to bind Aigis? Mine’s also custom-made, so they can track me down with it too!
Big Boss, be prepared. It’s been a while since we showed our true abilities.
No need to panic, don’t worry. There’s always a way when we get to it. Who do you think I am? I’m the goddess of luck!
Kazuma. Come out! If you come out now, I’ll merely lecture you!
This is unacceptable, my lady! If you’re a lady of a noble family, you should behave more demurely.
Don’t treat me as a noble lady only at times like this! Kazuma, come out and explain yourself! Or else Chris here will receive your punishment too!
Assistant-kun, save me!!
Too bad, Darkness. This trick won’t work on me. That sounded like Chris, but my reliable Big Boss won’t give in so easily. You’re using Aqua’s Super Entertainer magic to mimic her voice, right? Don’t underestimate my reasoning power. That’s right. It was your voice earlier!
Wrong. Assistant-kun, what are you saying? There must be a limit to your reason!!
Kazuma, it’s about time you come out! There is only Chris and I here. No police, no people from the Undine family. Come, your boss may end up very badly. Is this really okay for you?
Go right ahead.
Traitor! Hey Darkness, untie my rope! I’ll help you get Assistant-kun out!
Y-You two are really…!
So, why were you doing this? Last time, you promised to notify me at the start. Seriously. There are eyewitnesses from the Undine family. A lot of people including the city’s adventurers are hunting you down for the bounty!
I’ve said it before, ‘If the other party’s a noble, maybe we can ask Darkness for help. Use Darkness’s family for political advantage.’. Then, Big Boss…
Ah? It’s true that Assistant-kun said it before! But Darkness, that noble acquired the divine relic via illegal means and his reputation isn’t good. He’ll definitely deny it! And you were busy with the lordship duties!
If you intend to commit a crime, I’ll think of something no matter how busy I am. Even for something acquired illegally, nobles have their ways of dealing with it. If the price is right, it’s still possible to negotiate with nobles who are very sensitive to benefits. And…!
Ow! Ow! Darkness, stop! I’m sorry. Next time I’ll inform you before stealing!
Don’t you have other options besides stealing? Anyway, I’m most angry with–!
After that incident with me last night, it’s unforgivable for you to leave as if nothing happened! Don’t you have complex emotions of excitement and confusion? Do you know? When I think back on what I did, I struggled internally for a long time due to the embarrassment…!
Ugh! Stop, stop! My head’s about to crack! Sorry. Sorry, it’s my fault! But if it’s so embarrassing, then don’t do it in the first place! Anyway, that cliffhanger kind of kiss was unbearable for me too!
Whoa!
Whoa…! What Assistant-kun said last night was true…! You really did it! Darkness really took the initiative to kiss someone!!
Hey? Chris, this isn’t important right now! Anyway– Kazuma, you even told her such things?
It can’t be helped. Big Boss was interrogating me for coming so late! Anyway, given our current relationship, there’s no need to be embarrassed over a kiss! We washed each other’s backs and saw each other naked in the bath before, didn’t we? You even suggested becoming adults together when I broke into your house.
Ugh! Kazuma, you…! Fine, I understand. This topic is over. I’ve got no time to fool around with you! I’ll undo the ropes. Leave. Both of you can help!
I just heard something amazing again. What was that about? Which stage is your relationship at? Am I the only one who’s still a kid?
Chris, we’ll talk about it another time! Come, let me remove your rope…
It can’t wait! I want details! Wait, Darkness. Why aren’t you telling me? What happened to the friendship between us girls?
Y-You’re annoying, Chris. That’s not important! Seriously, both of you. Aqua. Megumin. Why must everyone make trouble when I’m acting as the lord?
… Uh? Hey, besides me, did Aqua and Megumin cause trouble too?
… Megumin’s being held at the police station. Supposedly, she used Explosion magic for no reason within the city. No matter how she was interrogated, she just said, ‘It was unbearable since I couldn’t use magic during the fireworks display. My Explosion magic’s prettier than other fireworks. I won’t repent, but I’ll compensate.’. They decided to lock her up until the end of the festival.
What about Aqua? What trouble did she cause again?
Using the unexpected popularity and turnover of this festival as the reason… The Axis cultists want to host the Goddess Aqua Thanksgiving Festival by themselves next year.
Hey Aqua! What’s going on?
Oh, Kazuma. What’s wrong? Why are you so panicked?
Wait, I know. Kazuma, you smelled a banquet and came over for some free food, right? I guess there’s no helping it, then. You may not be an Axis cultist, but you do deserve some of the credit this time. Come here and sit by my side, I’ll share some yakisoba with you.
Now’s not the time to eat, moron! What the hell isthis?!
Eh? Isn’t this the proposal I made? ‘First, from next year onwards, change the festival name to the Goddess Aqua Thanksgiving Festival and disassociate it from the Eris Church. Second, relax the restrictions on Tokoroten Slime…’ Hey, I don’t remember writing that second one!
I wrote the second point, Aqua-sama! I worked really hard this time, so I think I deserve a reward!
I see, that’s fine then. So? What’s wrong with this?
It’s not fine, and there’s tons of things wrong! Tell me what the hell this is about!
Hey, why do you think Kazuma’s so angry? Is it because we didn’t invite him to our celebration?
I don’t think so, Aqua-sama. It must be because we didn’t include his wishes when we wrote the proposal.
Third, from now on, swimsuits will be the official uniform for poster girls during the festival.
Aaaaaaah!! Hey, what’re you doing?! I even went through all the trouble of adding in your wish, too!
Wait, how could you just waste Aqua-sama’s good will like that? I may be unworthy of representing the Axis Cult, but I’ll stand outside your house every night and endlessly sing hymns if I have to, you know?
Try it if you can! I’m going to punish every last person who did something this stupid, including you two!
W-Why?! We’ve worked so hard, shouldn’t it be okay to get just a little favorable treatment?! It’s like Cecily said, ‘Aqua-sama is Aqua-sama after all. You deserve to live a pleasant life, so from now on the Axis Cult will put its full effort into pampering you.’!
Don’t be so easily influenced by people you’ve just met! Look, just go home and stop getting involved with weird things like this already! That goes for you too, don’t make Aqua anymore useless than she already is!
What do you mean ‘weird things like this’?!
I’m not going back while this festival is still going. Yeah, I’m definitely not going back! …I’m a genius you know, I’ve figured it all out. As long as I stay here, everyone will worship me! And besides, evenyouhave to agree that this festival has been a much bigger success than normal. No matter what happens, there’s no way they won’t hold a Goddess Aqua Thanksgiving Festival next year, and all the years after too. Meanwhile, just go outside and look at the Eris Church’s festival! Day after day, their customers have been streaming away to our stalls! Almost all of their stalls have fallen into slumps by now!
It’s just as Aqua-sama said. Our stalls are very popular now. At this stage, it’s almost impossible for the Eris Church’s side to become popular again. Also… Please don’t think that you’re the only one with business sense here. Aqua-sama’s come up with some amazing plans!
Hm? Assistant-kun, how’d it go?
I couldn’t do a thing. It’s too late for me to talk them out of this, and besides, they’re the type that can only learn by crashing and burning… What am I supposed to do now? This all only happened because I helped Aqua get a festival permit, so I’m at fault here. I’ll have to figure out some way to slap some sense into them before they do anything even dumber.
Senpai deserves to be thanked by the people for making this festival so popular. On the other hand, I couldn’t even recover Aigis. That armor is so conspicuous, yet I still couldn’t find its current location. Maybe not holding a festival for me next year is for the best. I might feel a little lonely, but I’m sure senpai will make the festival lively next year too!
I’m sorry I keep troubling you, Assistant-kun. First it was recovering the divine relics, and now it’s asking you to stop senpai’s recklessness.
Thank you, Assistant-kun. You’re the only person who knows my true identity, as well as what I’ve been doing. I haven’t been secretly working against the Demon King’s army secret because I wanted to be praised but… Because of you, I feel like all of my hard work has been worth it.
Big Boss… No, Eris-sama. There’s something I’d like the Eris cultists to help out with.
I have a plan.
I’m very happy and honored to be the host of this event…
A special event for this festival, organized by the Eris Church— The first Goddess Eris Beauty Pageant has officially begun!
Hey, Assistant-kun? There are so many things wrong with this situation I don’t know which one I should complain about.
It’s fine to just enjoy the festival, Big Boss.
I still can’t believe Darkness actually accepted your willful request.
Doesn’t that just show how important Eris-sama is to her?
Using Eris-sama’s name for a beauty pageant is blasphemy!
This’ll restore the prestige of the Eris Churchandhelp us recover a divine relic. Eris-sama won’t mind.
I-If it’s just using my name, I don’t really mind…
Tell that to Darkness. She was still insisting that she didn’t want to go this morning.
…Um, I think the main reason Darkness didn’t want to participate wasn’t the beauty pageant itself, it was…
Now for the first contestant… Please tell us your name, age, and occupation!
Hmmm… In my opinion, she’s too thin. Her face is nice at least, but that’s about it…
Is that so? She seems like she’d have a strong personality type too. But you know, her figure is actually quite nice. It’s just her clothes that make her look thin.
That’s true, she definitely seems strong-willed. A slender body and a strong will, that’s a good combination. But she’s the type who looks thin in clothes, huh… I should’ve asked the judges to include a swimsuit segment.
Hey, why didn’t you include such an important item? What kind of idiot are you?!
I’ve caught you!
Ugh! What is this? What are you doing?! Don’t fool around while something so important is happening!
I didn’t think you’d be dumb enough to take the bait so fast. This beauty pageant was organized to lure you out!
Wh-What did you say?! That’s actually a little impressive, my opinion of you has gone up!
Anyway, you came way too fast! It hasn’t even been five minutes since the pageant started! You’d better apologize to Chris, she went off to buy some drinks because she thought this would take a while!
Hey, can you quiet down? I can’t hear that girl’s self-introduction. Look, the host is asking her what she’s been eating to get breasts that big.
…I guess there’s no other way, then. We’ll continue after she finishes. But I get to keep the upper hand here, okay?
That’s fine, we’ll resume after that girl goes backstage.
Okay, let’s continue! I went through a lot of trouble because of you, so you’d better behave yourself!
Hah, come at me if you can! The Sacred Armor Aigis more than lives up to its reputation! In the past, my master and I sliced and diced an exceedingly great number of monsters! Throw whatever you want at me, I’ll cut it to ribbons!
Alright, thank you very much. And that was Sonya’s introduction! Wow, that contestant sure had some splendid twin peaks! But the next entry shouldn’t be underestimated either! She’s the well-endowed contestant who could potentially be the winner of this pageant!! Now, open the curtains!
…Hey, can we wait until she finishes before starting again?
…It can’t be helped. Let’s wait until then.
Sorry about this. Also, can you take a picture with that camera? Don’t worry, I won’t try to escape.
……Now that I think about it, there’s not much point trying to hold you down. There are so many people around that even if you tried to run away in all of that armor I could just ask them all for help and catch you easily. And holding this pose is exhausting, too.
Hey! Look at that, that’s foul play! Ugh, why couldn’t you arrange a swimsuit segment?!
I didn’t have a choice, I was in a tight spot too! My companion said that if she had to wear a swimsuit, she wouldn’t participate! But damn, now I’m kinda regretting it. If I knew things would be like this, I would’ve insisted…!
Hey, hey, hey, is that defenseless outfit really okay?! Then again, itissummer after all. I guess there’s nothing wrong with wearing a swimsuit!
She’s one of the poster girls, I was the one who suggested letting them wear swimsuits. It’s, um, to prevent heat stroke. Oh, and to make things more convenient during water fights.
You’re really quite clever. I suppose it can’t be helped if it’s to prevent heat stroke. It’d be bad if they got sick, after all. Woah there, the next girl isn’t very good. Her dress is cute, but she’s trying to get by on just her outfit and her makeup.
That’s just heresy, makeup should only enhance your natural look. If I were the judge, I’d deduct points for using that much.
Time for the next contestant! Everyone should be familiar with the destitute shop owner whose name is synonymous with ‘pitiful’! But recently she seems to have made some money, so the truth is somewhat different now! Her reason for participating is to win the prize money to clear her debts! Everyone, please welcome— the shop owner of Wiz’s Magic Tool Shop!
Yeeeeeees! It’s Wiz, it’s Wiz! Aaaah, I just knew that Wiz looked her best in an apron!
Hey, I want to hug this high level girl! I want to tightly hug this woman who looks so huggable! Or let her come inside me! But it’s obvious that she’s a magic user, how regrettable that her job is so incompatible with me. Damn it, why couldn’t she change to a frontline job?!
Now then, next up is… Oh. It’s the contestants in succubus costumes! To think they’d dare to dress up as demons even though this pageant is being held in the honor of Eris-sama, these ladies are quite… bold…
Uwaaaaaaaaaaah! Hey, what is this? To think that there’d be three people with such a high level! And the sultry lady on the right and the loli on the left are both very nice, but just what’s the deal with that beauty in the middle?! I’ve never seen such gorgeousness!  What a demon! No, a demon girl! That goes far beyond a mere devil, that’s an outright demon girl!
Everyone, good evening. After seeing so many contestants, everyone must be a little tired… Let me strip off my clothes and bring everyone into the world of fantasy…!
Hey, hey, get the camera! Get the camera ready! Stay focused!
Ah— My bad! That was dangerous, even I got caught up… But that’s a true succubus for you, what a pro at fanservice!
Gorgeous molting! Muwahahahahaha, did you think I was a succubus queen? Too bad, it was actually moi, the assistant of Wiz’s Magic Tool Shop! Oooh. This entire location is overflowing with negative emotions, how delicious!! Wiz’s Magic Tool Shop is currently offering life consultation. If anyone has any problems, please visit us!
Please don’t throw things onto the stage! I understand everyone’s feelings, I really do! But please stop throwing things!
N-Now then! Next up is a favorite to win today. Surely everyone in this town must already know her! Sometimes she’s an adventurer and sometimes she’s the multiple-time champion of the Endurance Contest. And now, she’s a contestant in the Goddess Eris Beauty Pageant! Please welcome the daughter of the noble Dustiness family, Lady Lalatina Ford Dustiness!
Wow! Good, good, she’s very good! A pretty face, a sexy figure,andshe’s a noble?! She’ll definitely get a high score!
That’s right, that’s right! This girl is one of my companions. I asked her to participate as bait to lure you out!
Are you serious? She’s great, really great! Hey, I’ll let her be my master! I’d definitely protect that sexy body from harm!
But she’s a Crusader, you know? A frontline job specialized in enduring the enemy’s attacks. Didn’t you say before that even an armor feels pain? And it might not be obvious right now, but she’s got a six pack of abs.
I see. Well, that’s nottoobad… But a Crusader… Damn it, why’d she have to be a Crusader… I really love how she looks too, it’ll probably be hard to find someone better…
Well, you might as well keep watching. There’re still other contestants.
You’re right, there’s no need to decide before the pageant is over. Oh, her self-introduction is starting.
Now then, let’s do this properly! Everyone should already know you, but please give us your name, age, and occupation!
…My name is Lalataina Ford Dustiness… I’m 18, and right now I’m working as the temporary lord…
Lalatina! Speak louder, we can’t hear you!
You’re so pretty today, young lady!
What happened to your usual armor? But what you’re wearing right now is cute too, Lalatina!
Well done, Lalatina! Now’s your chance to show us the abs that you’re so proud of!
Isn’t she your companion?
You moron, isn’t thatwhyI have to cheer her on? Look at that blushing face on the verge of tears. You won’t see something like that everyday, you know? She can definitely win like this!
I see, so you’re actually doing a good thing. Okay, I’ll help you! Hey miss, give us some more fanservice!
Yeah, yeah, show us your body!
How about putting on a swimsuit?
Your lordship, lift up your skirt for us!
You might as well strip!
That’s right. Strip now!
Darkness! Strip!
Strip! Strip!!
Strip! Strip!!
What are you twodoing?
—Seriously, you guys are terrible. Don’t bully my friend.
It’s not like that, it’s just that when I saw all of the attention and cheering Darkness was getting, I got the impulse to set her up as a… super idol or something…
But hey, at least we caught this thing like we were planning. And one way or another, this event’s made the Eris Church pretty popular too. Isn’t that a good thing?
This isn’t good at all! Anyway, how are we going to clean up this mess?!
This is getting interesting, that girl’s tough! Beauties and brawls are the spice of any festival, I’m getting pumped too! Burn, my passion! Glow, my body! Alright, I’m joining in on this fight!
So this kid’s talking about being a goddess again. Listen, girlie, I know goddesses. I’ve met with them before. Or rather, it was a goddess who gave me to a certain girl. Anyway, let me tell you this: when it comes to goddesses, there isn’t a single decent one around.
What did you saaaaaaaaaay?!
You…! You…!! Ugh, I can’t take this anymore! Before I find a suitable new master for you, I’ll seal you away in the lake! There are other divine relics in there, anyways, so you can just keep each other company!
A punch like that won’t leave a scratch onmybody! I’m a divine relic, after all! Haha, you should try harder, little girl!
Aaaaargh!
Man, that was hilarious. I guess this was supposed to be a beauty pageant, but all of the famous girls in our town onlylooknice. Something like this was bound to happen. But you know, for something that straight-laced Eris Church came up with, this was actually kinda fun.
Yeah, I guess. But personally, I think we should just let the Axis Cult host the festival next year. Those Axis cultists are all idiots, but they sure know how to throw a festival!
That’s right, those people might be idiots, but they’re always so merry! They really are idiots, though!
The Eris Chuch really did work hard, but for something like an annual festival it’s just better for things to be lively.
That’s for sure. I heard the planning committee’s still thinking about whether or not they should officially change it to the Aqua Festival next year. It might end up a vote.
Is that so? Well anyways, I bet the Axis cultists are doing some stupid stuff right now at their stalls. Let’s go over there once this event’s over.
Ah-Ahahah. The children here worked really hard, but I guess it couldn’t be helped. But wow, I guess people really are talking about canceling the Eris Festival from next year.
Actually, I guess I shouldn’t have been having fun at a festival in the first place. Even as we speak, a lot of people are being tormented by monsters… So I need to focus on gathering as many of the divine relics as I can.
Please, Aigis. Will you obey me?
Guh… This scene is a little moving, but I won’t obey you just because you look sad!
Hey, Aigis. I’ll introduce you to a very beautiful girl, so could you listen to Chris’s orders?
Big Boss… No. Let me address you as Eris-sama… I have a somewhat— No, a very difficult request.
It’s fine, Assistant-kun… No. I will listen to your request, Kazuma-san. If it is within my capabilities, please tell me.
Bah! I might have a calm temperament, but I’ll still get angry if you keep ignoring me! Hey, what’re you two planning?!
Hey, Aigis. I’ll let you see the real thing next.
…What… Huh? Uh, um…
…Um. We’ll consider you as a last minute contestant… if that’s… okay…?
That’s alright. I’m sorry for deciding to join the contest at the very last minute. I must have troubled everyone.
N-N-N-N-N-No, it’s okay! Amazing! What an amazing surprise! Thank you very much for participating in this Goddess Eris-sama Beauty Pageant!
–sama
Would this really happen?
So, um, so then… Because every contestant needs to answer some questions, please forgive me but… If you can, could you please tell us your name and such…
My name is Eris.
Eris-sama
S-So this is the power of a goddess. This goes way beyond any of my expectations.
I’ve found her…
I’ve found her. I’ve found heeeeeeeeeeer! I did it, I found her! I’ve found my master! Who is she? Hey, who is she!? Why is there such a beautiful girl in this world!? I don’t understand. I don’t understand!!
H-Hey, calm down! It’s weird saying this to an armor that shouldn’t even have a personality, but you’re breaking characterI
I, um, uh, wow, uh, th-thank you very much! Thank you very much for answering my question! Um… There are still two more questions, so…
Those are a secret.
No good! This is just no good! Eris-sama, please stop making those killer moves! I, Aigis, cannot endure any more of your mischievous poses!
You’re the only no good thing here, are you even the same armor anymore?! Anyways, you’re being noisy so shut up. If you can do that, I’ll introduce you to her.
Seriously!? Really? Did you… No, did milord just say that I’d be introduced to that lady?!
Yeah, isn’t it like I just said? ‘I’ll introduce you to a very beautiful girl, so could you listen to Chris’s orders?’ By the way, the goddess Eris standing over there is actually Chris. She said she was a goddess a few times herself, but you just refused to believe her.
Fuuuuuck! What should I do? What should I do!? How should I apologize to Eris-sama!? Hey, you, come and apologize with me. I’ll let you wear me for a while!
The goddess Eris-sama has descended!
—Eris-sama, please shake my hand! Recently, I’ve been really unlucky! Please bless me as the goddess of luck!
Me too! Eris-sama, please shake hands with me too!
You idiot, I was first!
Eris-sama, I have a hungry kitten at home! Please bless me so I can win the lottery on my way home…!
Everyone, please calm down! Please don’t climb onto the stage!
Hey, we have to protect Eris-sama!
Y-Yeah, this is getting bad! Look. There’s a greedy idiot who’s holding Eris-sama’s hand and refusing to let go!
Hey, Aigis, help out already! If this keeps up, Eris-sama will get squashed! If you want to apologize to her, then do a good job protecting her!
Oh! What is this development that could let me die without regrets?! I’ll definitely protect her! I’ll super protect her! Let me, the Sacred Armor Aigis, protect Eris-sama’s untainted body and her chaste blood!
Huh? No, um, what do you mean by chasteblood…? You must not know much about this. Do you even know what that means?
Eris-sama is a goddess, so she must be a virgin! She must be the type that will scream and cover her face in embarrassment when she sees a naked man. But she’ll still peek through her fingers because she’s slightly curious. She’s kind-hearted and gentle, so her scent is very fragrant.
Hey, hurry up already! Once you reach the stage, hide Eris-sama inside yourself then break through the mob!
This is great! To think I’d become one with Eris-sama so soon! E-Eris-sama will be inside my body… Heheheh…
Hey, are you really okay? Why do I suddenly feel like you’re the most dangerous thing here? You should just concentrate on clearing the mob, didn’t you say you were good at fighting?
Indeed. After finding my true master, I’m blazing hotter than anyone else in this crowd! Make way! Touch me and you’ll get burnt!
Agh, hot! What’s wrong with this guy?! Who wears a full suit of armor on a day as hot as this? He’s crazy!
Don’t push! Your hot plate armor’s going to burn… No… Ugh!
Pour some water on this guy!
K-Kazuma-san! H-How should we resolve this disturbance…?
Aigis is coming. Hide inside him and escape to somewhere quiet! …Hey, you! Stop holding onto Eris-sama’s hand! If you like shaking hands so much, then give my hand a try!
No, stop! I’ve already vowed to never to wash my hand again for the rest of my life!
Sorry for the wait, master. Please enter my body! The chant to equip me is ‘I want to be Aigis’ bride!’ Hurry, say it!
I-I want to be Aigis’ br…
Don’t be tricked, Eris-sama! And you! Stop messing around already, this isn’t the time!
If I must… Come, master! Combine!
Hot! It’s so hot, Kazuma-san! I’m going to be cooked!
Freeze!
Magic is useless.
Eris-sama vanished?
Where did Eris-sama go?!
Did she return to the heavens?
No, those two guys who climbed onto the stage did something!
This is bad… Hey, Aigis! I’ll draw their attention, you run away with Eris-sama!
Leave it to me! And since you’re so working hard, let me reward you with some good news! Just as I thought, Eris-sama smells really good!
K-Kazuma-san?! The crowd is getting violent, that’s too dangerous…!
It’ll be fine. These guys don’t have any weapons, I can’t lose.
Why don’t you cool your heads?! Create Water!
Gwah?! This bastard!
You’ve really done it now! Hey, let’s do him in!
That’s Kazuma, the infamously weak adventurer! Gang up on him!
Big Boss, please get out of here. It’s the minion’s job to cover for the boss when they have to escape capture, after all.
A-Assistant-kun…
Anyways, today’s the last day of the festival. When you think about festivals, you should think of stalls and fireworks. And of course, the spice of any festival, a brawl!
Bring it on!
Assistant-kun!
Well if it isn’t the mastermind. So? What do you have to say for yourself about this incident?
stay here and calm down
Hey. I’m grateful you bailed me out, but isn’t this treatment is a bit much?
And why are you calling me a mastermind? Tell me the details of what happened after I was arrested by the police.
Then let me ask you… When you suggested to the shopping district chairman to let both cults jointly host the festival, did you say: ‘If we incite Axis Cult and Eris Church to compete, the festival will become livelier and the shopping district will make more money.’?
And I heard from Aqua that you were the one who first thought of combining the Eris Thanksgiving Festival and the Aqua Thanksgiving Festival. Meanwhile, the shopping district chairman said that you were the one who came up with those suspicious proposals like making the poster girls wear swimsuits and that costume parade… It’s all true, isn’t it, Mr. Advisor? This was brought over by the chairman. He said it was your reward.
Don’t make that guilty expression like we’re bullying you. But still, I guess I shouldn’t blame you. It’s not like keeping a cut of the festival’s profits was something the previous landlord did. You should be proud of yourself and openly take this money… What? Aren’t you going to take it, Mr. Advisor?
Darkness, wait. There’s something I’m concerned about too… Kazuma. I’ve heard that recently, you’ve gotten close to a lot of women. For example, you’ve supposedly been out drinking all night with those women who dressed up as succubi. Now I’m not saying you can’t do that. After all, it’s not like you’redating anyone.
Y-You really did as you pleased this time… Um, but I guess it’s not my place to criticize your private life. We don’t have that kind of relationship, after all… But we were getting along so well, don’t you feel guilty at all?
Wait, I just heard something I can’t ignore! When were you two ‘getting along so well’? What’s that supposed to mean? Do you think you’re some kind of princess now after he saved you from the landlord? But more importantly, exactly how well are you two getting along? What stage are you at? Did you cross the line during the festival and enter a physical relationship? That’s just debauchery!
N-No, it’s not like that…! Actually, we don’t even have a physical relationship yet…!
Did you say ‘yet’? So it’s going to become that kind of relationship someday?! You slut!
Hey, Aqua. Don’t you think that right now I’m like a harem protagonist?
Wait, you’re being lectured right now. Why are you so happy?
Anyways. Anyways! Aqua! Next up is you! Really, how are you going to solve this?!
…Darkness, let’s talk this over. It’s like that masked devil said, humans are a species capable of communicating.
That’s true. I think communication is very important too. Yes, if you’d talked to me from the start, things wouldn’t have become like this.
But wow, who would’ve thought that you could come up with such an impressive marketing scheme. A scheme that’s only profitable for the people at the top, too. Hey, isn’t it amazing thatAquacame up with something so amazing?
So, just who taught you this ‘pyramid scheme’? I find it quite hard to believe that you could come up with such a difficult crime on your own.
Stop screwing around, you’re just trying to frame me! Wait, now that I think about it, a long time ago when I was complaining about our debts I said ‘Sheesh. We can’t make money at all. Maybe I should try out a pyramid scheme.’ And then I explained how to do it!
So itwasyou! How involved do you have to be in this incident before you’re satisfied?!
Wait, I didn’t ask her to do this! In my country, this was widely considered criminal… Hey, Aqua. You should’ve known very well that this was criminal! Don’t pretend you didn’t hear that part!
I couldn’t help it! I heard that Eris herself shamelessly joined the beauty contest pageant! If things kept going the way they were, the Eris Church would become popular again! And besides, I needed a lot of money to host the Aqua Festival by itself next year…!
That’s not an excuse to commit a crime! And now that I think about it, the root of this problemwasyou whining about wanting the Axis Cult to host a Thanksgiving Festival…
But, but, isn’t it unfair to only praise Eris? Why can’tIhave a festival!? Why can’tIbe praised!? I want to be served and worshipped too! And besides, pyramid schemes aren’t considered a crime!
You’re right, they’re not a crime yet. Notyet, that is! There just isn’t a law regarding this new form of scam yet, it’s clearly something wicked!
Since the law couldn’t stop me, what I did can’t be considered a crime! So give me back the money I made! Give me back the funds for next year’s Aqua Festival!
That money has already been returned to the victims! Aqua, if you keep this up, you’ll have a criminal record like Megumin and Kazuma!
Hey, wait, I only got put in jail to clear my head, that’s not a criminal record!
Yeah, what he said! I only got warned by the police, too!
Kazuma, you’re late, we’ve already started! Hey, come over here!
You shut-in schemer, describing Eris cultists as devils is going too far. And this is to celebrate the end of the festival, right? My children won’t make a scene during this banquet.
So are you people just the type to get easier to deal with after partying all day?
That feels like you’re looking down on us, but you’re not wrong. By the way, I’m like that too. If you want me to be easier to deal with, then bring me some high quality wine every day.
So you admit that you’re usually a troublemaker.
Come on Darkness, drink up! Megumin, you too!
Why are you always so excited during banquets? H-Hey! Fine, okay, I’ll drink something. But don’t drag Megumin into this! I’ll drink Megumin’s share too!
I’m not a kid anymore, Darkness, so let me drink at times like this! I’m old enough to get married, you know! Oh, Kazuma, you’re late. Hey, help me explain this! I’m only two years younger than you, so I’m not that young!
Nah, you’re too young to drink alcohol. Also, we’rethreeyears apart now. Wanna know why? Because today’s my birthday!
Huh. Happy birthday, I guess? Okay then, Kazuma, give me a present now.
…A present? Hey, what’s that supposed to mean? Why do I have to giveyoua present?
I guess you really are just an idiot who doesn’t know this country’s customs. Fine, I’ll tell you. In this country, the birthday person gives presents to the people who took care of him the past year out of gratitude. It’s something like, ‘Thanks to everyone, I made it through the year safely.’
There’s no custom like that. Happy birthday, Kazuma. I’ll give you a present later.
Well aren’t you good at lying, you who-knows-how-old hag! Hey, how about you tell me another one? What’s your birthday and age, huh?!
Uwaaaaaah! Kazuma, you’ve said something you shouldn’t have again! I’ll have to beat some sense into you!
Happy birthday, Kazuma. When we get home, I’ll give you a present too. I’m sorry, I would’ve prepared one earlier if I’d known.
Oh, thanks. I guess it’s my fault for not mentioning it earlier, huh. Megumin’s birthday ended up passing by unnoticed too, so we can just celebrate mine next time. By the way, now that I think about it, when’s your birthday? You’re a noble, so I’m sure there’ll be one hell of a party.
Huh? M-My birthday? …U-Um, you see…
Darkness’ birthday happened a long time ago. There was that huge party in spring, right? Oh, now that I think about it, why didn’t Assistant-kun and the others come to the party?
Let me guess. You thought that something bad would happen if we came, so you intentionally didn’t invite us, right? You thought we’d do something stupid to the other nobles, right?!
Wait, really?! That’s going too far! Oh, now that I think about it, back when we got that commendation from that kid Iris too, Darkness suggested that we decline!
Let’s punish her! Today we’re going to punish this rich girl who thinks too much!
That turned into a mess… Anyways, I heard from Darkness that you were the mastermind behind this entire incident?
A-About that, I’mreallysorry. I’ll help you search for the divine relics, so please forgive me… But you know, the merchant district committee said that, ‘Afterthathappened, the Goddess Eris Thanksgiving Festival definitely has to go on now.’
It will? …Well, since you and Aigis helped me out back on stage so much, I guess I’ll forgive you this time!
I’m truly grateful, milady goddess. Thank you so very much!
Sigh… Do you think Eris-sama is still somewhere in this town? I’ve been longing for her ever since the first time I saw her portrait…
Even if she was, she wouldn’t appear beforeyouand your evil thoughts. Only a sincere Eris cultist like myself could someday meet her.
You’re the evil one here, you spent the savings for your marriage on the teleport service here just so you could get here faster.
You idiot, I came here to get Eris-sama’s blessing for my marriage. I talked about it with my girlfriend and everything.
…Did you hear that? Aren’t you going to bless him, Eris-sama?
Assistant-kun, I’m not Eris-sama right now. I’m Chris-sama. The only thing I can do for him now is to steal treasure from your house to compensate that man for his wedding savings.
O-Oh, I’m sorry!
I’m very sorry!
I’m the one who should apologize for stopping so suddenly. Are you two okay? You’re not hurt, are you?
S-Sorry! I can’t believe I let such a pretty chris fall on the ground..
Chris? …Is that the flower’s name?
That’s right, this flower is called a chris. In the language of flowers, it means ‘a heart that never gives up’.
Woooow. Hey, why do you have a scar on your face? Are you an adventurer? Daddy says that adventurers are all punks. But if you’re a punk, why do you know so much about flowers?
Um… I got this scar during a fight with the bad guys in the Demon King’s army. And I’m an adventurer, yes, but not all adventurers are punks. Like this onii-chan over here.
And I’m only familiar with this flower in particular. Look, it has the same color as my eyes, right? Personally, I really like chrises.
Oh, I get it now. This flower is an offering to Eris-sama. My sister and I put our allowances together to buy it.
Yeah, I heard that Eris-sama also really likes chrises!
Wow… I’m impressed, you even know what Eris-sama likes! But if Eris-sama knew that kids like you were spending your allowances on flowers for her, she’d be happy, but also sad too. So let’s make this the last time you do this. I’m sure Eris-sama would be happier that way.
Oh… But, we really wanted to thank Eris-sama.
…You want to thank her?
Yeah, we do. Mommy said that everybody can live peacefully because Eris-sama gives people all kinds of powers to fight the evil Demon King.
Oh, and she also said that Eris-sama secretly does good things in places nobody knows about. That’s why we wanted to thank Eris-sama, and cheer her on too.
I-I see… Well, even if you don’t make any more offerings from now on, I’m sure that your feelings alone will make Eris-sama very happy. She’ll definitely be very grateful for your support.
…Now that I think about it, your eyes and hair look like they’re the same color as Eris-sama’s.
My sister already has a flower we can offer, so this one is for you. Thank you for protecting us from monsters, adventurer!
Thank you!
Ah-Ahaha. Okay, okay, I give up. I, I should thank you too…!
Okay, see you again mister! Bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
Huh?! Hey, wait! I’m not a mister, I’m a miss!
Hey. Does the name ‘Chris’ come from…
That’s right. It comes from this flower.
…And here I thought you just swapped out the ‘E’ in ‘Eris’.
What kind of person do you think I am?
Well, if I had to say… You’re the person who’s always been working really hard behind everyone’s backs, the one person I can actually respect.
…O-Oh. I see, that’s, um, that’s good.
Woah there, are you embarrassed now? Did I just embarrass you, Big Boss?
You’re being annoying, Assistant-kun. Shut up for a bit.
I can tell even with your back facing me, you’re blushing so hard that even your ears are red. Like I thought, Eris-sama sure is cute. Will you marry me?
You’re being an annoyance, Kazuma-san. If you keep teasing goddesses any further, you’ll suffer divine retribution. And please don’t say things like that so casually, or else I’ll tell Darkness and Megumin later that you proposed to me.
Hey, Assistant-kun?
What?
…Thanks. For a lot of things.
Hey, Kazuma, Cecily sent a letter to thank you. ‘Thanks to you, the Axis Cult’s Axel branch has successfully achieved our goal. As arranged with the Eris Cult, the next year’s festival will also be co-hosted by both cults. This is all thanks to Kazuma-san donating so much money, so we will therefore consider you an honorary Axis cultist.
Damn it!
Wahhh!
You’re awful! What, aren’t you happy with the thank-you letter my cultist put so much effort into writing, you Sukapon NEET?!
There’s nothing here to be happy about! Why do I have to become on ofyourworshippers?! This has to be some kind of punishment game!
Heheh, I see now, you’re just being a tsundere again. Kazuma’s a tsundere, so I should just hear the opposite of what you say, right? It’s like Cecily said. You’re a giant tsundere so whenever you say something mean I should just flip it around.
I hate both you and that woman.
…Why is it that I don’t feel any of the charm of a tsundere from you?
Oh, right. Kazuma, there’s something I want to ask you. I heard Eris appeared during the beauty pageant, do you know where she went? Sheesh, she’s just too much. She went through all of the trouble of coming down here and didn’t even greet me. She’s so heartless towards her senpai.
Hey, you’ll suffer in the future if you keep treating Emperor Zell so roughly, you know. When he grows up, I won’t stop it if it attacks you.
Okay, then I’ll finish him off while he’s still small.
…Don’t worry, Emperor Zell is kind and magnanimous, you don’t need to be afraid… Hey, Emperor Zell, come over here. This guy is as scary as the butcher on the third street, you need to be careful.
*Sigh*… And the work was finally done, too… I should be thankful that Eris-sama manifested, but the sudden influx of tourists was overwhelming…
Good work. Being a lord must be hard. And hey, Eris-sama manifesting may have brought in a ton of tourists from all sorts of cities, but that’s helped improve the economy. Isn’t that a good thing?
I suppose it’s good that there’s so many people, but… Well, my father started to recover during the festival. Those troubling lordship duties are finally over as of today, so from now on I can go on quests without reservations.
Huh? What’re you talking about, don’t you know that I’m not doing any of those anymore? There’s finally no more reasons I should, after all. If I wanted money I could just use my Cooking skill to open up a restaurant with cute waitresses and cater to my hobbies and make a profit at the same time. I don’t need to go on quests anymore, right, Aqua?
That’s right. I want to focus on educating Emperor Zell right now, so forget about quests. I used all of the money from Kazuma to rebuild the church, to fund next year’s festival, and on the banquet. From now on, I’ll be living leisurely off of Kazuma’s money, so I won’t be taking any dangerous quests. Yes, I want to live idly in this mansion everyday and be worshipped during the annual festival.
… Hey, wait, why do I have to spend money on you? I don’t mind covering food expenses, I guess, but at least earn your own allowance… And wait, did I hear that right? You’ve already spent all of the money I gave you?
Yup, all of it. And don’t worry about my allowance, I’ve thought up my second and third new money-making schemes.
You were so enthusiastic during the festival… And Aqua, I heard that. What are these two money-making schemes? Tell me before you do anything.
Nope.
It’s too bad. The festival finally came, but in the end nothing fun happened. It was just noisy like always, and then it was over. Oh well, I guess that’s normal for us.
It really is. A festival should be a merry, noisy place where you have fun, that’s what sets the mood. Something as sad as fighting monsters during a fireworks display should never happen. I wish the festival was a little longer. At the very least, I’d like a proper fireworks display.
I’m fine with anything. But to be honest, I’m kind of worried about what you’ll give me. Don’t be like Aqua and give me some strangely shaped rock, okay?
Could you come to my room tonight? I have something important to tell you.
Uh, Lady Aqua… It’s difficult for me to work if you keep hugging me…
E-Even ifyoutell me…
Won’t Wiz be purified if you keep touching her? Don’t get in the way of her work, let her go.
Don’t worry, I’m suppressing my divine aura. As long as I keep thinking about despicable things, the purification’s power will naturally be weakened.
…What’re you thinking about in the middle of the day you slut?
…Oh, just the things you’re usually thinking about.
It’s completed!
You know, I’ve been wondering for a while, what have you been making?
Good question!
This is my latest magic item! It’s a bit embarrassing to praise myself, but this is a flawless and convenient item! It may have limited uses, but it’ll allow anyone to easily use healing magic…
Ah!? What’re you doing, Aqua-sama? I spent so much effort to make this!
Sorry, Wiz. I’ll make her pay you back, so… Hey, don’t just suddenly pretend you’re sleep!
I-I guess I won’t make a loss, at least. I can probably make it through the month…
But you know, aren’t you a famous wizard? Can’t you create something easier to sell? I don’t think normal mages would be able to make something like you can, right?
That’s right, creating magic items requires a lot of mana. For something like this, I think only the Crimson Demon magic artisans could make it.
Hey, hypothetically, could you make a doll that runs on mana? Not those weird things Vanir uses for attacking, mind you, just a doll shaped like a pretty girl.
I suppose it’s possible. I should be able to make something that looks like a regular human and be capable of simple housework.
Sell that!!
Huh!? Ah, no, it’d bepossibleto make, but it’d be very, very expensive.
That’s not a problem, it’ll sell! It’ll definitely sell! At the very least, people with weird names like mine would definitely buy it!
Will it really? Um, I think it’d be cheaper to make a golem or just hire maids…
It would be perfect if it could speak too, but being able to do housework is enough. It’ll sell, I’m sure it’ll rake in the cash!
Well, I think speaking simple words would be possible too…
Perfect!
No, I really do meansimpleresponses…! At the most, it’d be something like, ‘Yes, master’, or , ‘Welcome back, master’…
I’d buy it without a single bit of hesitation. Please, start working on this right away. Listen, Wiz, trust me. This will change the world.
O-Okay! I’ll work hard. Now I’m kind of excited, too!
That’s the way! And I’ll help you with whatever I can!
Then, I have something I’d like Kazuma-san to help with right now…
For some time now, my back has been feeling very hot. If this goes on, I’ll be incinerated so… Please think of a way to make Aqua-sama… Ow! Aqua-sama, that’s hot! Please get off quickly, Aqua-sama!
Hey, Aqua, get up! You idiot, why’re you glowing!? Wiz’s going to do something incredible, so wake up already!!
Explosion–!!
How many points was that?
– Hmm. Based on the destructiveness alone, I’d give it 90 points. But I noticed that the intensity of the heat wave wasn’t as strong as it usually is. You were trying to control it to accommodate for the summer heat, weren’t you?
Exactly. I thought to myself, ‘Is only focusing on raw destructive power really good enough?’. So I decided that for today’s Explosion spell, I’d try making a cool breeze. What’d you think of the wind that blew away all that hot and stuffy air? I think it’ll be a good addition to Axel’s natural scenery.
For your consideration of the audience and for the beautiful roundness of that crater, I’ll give you 97 points today!
Thank you very much! I’ll keep on doing my best!
Sorry for always bothering you like this.
If you’re really sorry, then raise your level already. Boost your max MP high enough so you don’t collapse anymore, okay?
This’ll probably keep happening no matter how many times I level up; you know? I mean, I put all the skill points I get from leveling up into increasing the power of my Explosion magic.
What?! I was wondering why even after all this time your max MP hadn’t caught up with your MP costs… So you were doing that all along? And here I was thinking that we wouldn’t have to carry you home like this once you got your level high enough. Give me back those hopes!
What’s so bad about it? Isn’t the occasional skinship between companions a necessity?
Hey, you of all people have absolutely no right to say that.
The me from back when I lived in the Crimson Demon village probably would’ve never believed I’d end up cherishing my companions so much.
Yeah, well, I’m not really feeling that cherishment right now…
So what were you like back then? Actually, more importantly, what possessed you to be crazy enough to learn Explosion?
How rude of you to call me insane. As for what I was like, well…
I used to never interact with anyone. Since I was a genius, I thought I’d be fine even if I was alone.
Oh, so you were already a chuuni back then? Er, I mean, you were a nutcase even as a kid?
Okay, okay, my bad! Let me try again! Basically, you were just an unwanted– Ow, ow, ow! Hey, go easy on me! Your level and strength are both higher than mine!
Well, it’s your fault for saying something so uncalled for… Anyway, you wanted to hear the story of how I learned Explosion magic, right?
Yeah, right! You can’t learn Explosion unless someone else teaches you first, right? So, I was wondering what kind of troublesome person your teacher was.
Calling the benefactor I looked up to so much a troublesome person is very rude. Ah, that’s right…
– I’ll tell you after I show certain person my Explosion magic.
Could you come to my room tonight? I have something important to tell you.
Rejoice, everybody! While I was loitering around the shopping district earlier, somebody told me that I could take the leftover liquor from the thanksgiving festival after-party back home with me! Look here, this is an expensive top-grade brand! Let’s party till dawn!
You really can’t read the mood at all, huh?
N-No, no, no, Darkness. Hold on a second. I think everyone should turn in early tonight. You’ve got to be tired after everything that’s happened, right?
Not particularly. Be it managing the festival or fulfilling my duties as the landlord, everything’s over with now. There hasn’t been anything tiring lately.
Well look, I’m tired from fighting monsters day in and day out. So I’ll be heading to bed early tonight.
Are you joking? You didn’t even leave the mansion today, and you sleep more than twelve hours a day anyway.
I think it’s a great idea too. Kazuma, let’s just party all night with everyone, okay?
Huh?!
Look. We’re even eating your favorite, Onion Duck Hot Pot. And these aren’t farm-raised ducks either, they’re straight from the wild. They’re full of experience points so they’re twice as delicious.
Hey, Megumin, is this really okay? What about that thing tonight…?
Isn’t tomorrow night fine too? There’s still plenty of time.
What’s got you so bothered, Kazuma? Your nostrils are widening. It’s the same expression you make when you spend the night outside every now and then.
I-I-It’s nothing! I’m just super happy my favorite Onion Duck’s on the menu tonight! Yum, this duck looks delicious, I bet I’ll be leveling up again!
Here in Axel, we’re high class ladies, so we should have an all-girls meeting every now and then
So. What’ve you been up to till now, Megumin? You’ve been messing around with something I’ve never seen before.
… This thing? It’s a Crimson Demon tradition, an amulet with magical properties. You stuff the hair of people with powerful magic into an amulet, then give it to a comrade. It might only be psychological reassurance, but I still want to gift you this for your birthday, since you die so often.
That sounds nice. Will anyone’s hair do? And is it the type where the more you put in, the more effective it gets…?
Yes, it’ll be more effective. That’s why we gave the people who went out to defeat the Demon King an amulet filled with the hair of the entire village. There was so much hair that it was on the verge of bursting, so that amulet must’ve definitely worked. And by the way, this amulet does more than just protect its owner; it also has the excellent effect of ensuring that your luggage won’t ever be stolen. And if you ever lose it, someone will give it back to you immediately.
May you put this in for me too? I don’t have powerful magic, so there probably won’t be much of an effect.
…? What? Are all of you so insolent that you’d ask for the hair of a goddess like me? Listen carefully, the hair of a goddess’s sacred and rare-
Cut the bullshit, read the mood and hand it over! The festival’s already over, and you’re still saying that you’re a goddess?!
I don’t wanna–! Okay, I get it, don’t pull my hair like that! It hurts, at least use some scissors to cut a strand off!
Okay then. Kazuma, please take this. It’s only for mental comfort, so you can just stuff it somewhere in your belongings.
Oh, all right, thanks.
My hair has powerful effects, so you’d better cherish that amulet. Or else you’ll receive divine retribution.
Will having this on me drop my intelligence or attract the undead?
… Hey Darkness, you promised, so help me build a pet house for Emperor Zell.
Hey, tell me! Will I attract the undead if I have this on me?!
What’s with that devious smile on your face? Are you thinking of something indecent?
No! I’m not thinking about anything weird, and this isn’t a devious smile! It’s just a gentle smile!
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Are you nervous because it’s just the two of us?
I’m just a little bothered by what you said earlier, that you had something to tell me. Erm, no, I’m not really bothered, all right? I don’t have any weird expectations or anything, there’ve been plenty of times where you built up my anticipation then just left me hanging after all.
What I wanted to tell you was…
Sorry, Megumin! Aqua’s calling for you. Could you come over for a bit? She said that I was too clumsy and useless, so she wants you to substitute for me…! I-In her words, ‘I didn’t ask you to destroy the pet house, I asked you to help build it! Just get Megumin over here and deal with that slacker Kazuma so he won’t get in my way!’…
Shouldn’t this be my time to shine? I’m the expert with crafting skills, so why’s she asking for Megumin?
No, I told her that too. But she said that you’ll definitely do something unnecessary and shape Emperor Zell’s house like a stove or something.
Hey, what’s that supposed to mean? If anything, it should be the other way around.
… Hey Kazuma, what’s going on between you and Megumin?
Absolutely nothing.
That’s impossible! If there’s nothing between you two, then what’s going on with Megumin’s behavior?! I’ve already heard from Aqua, she said that you’ve been looking for Megumin at her room every night. Did you do something to her there? You attempted to lay your hands on her back at the Crimson Demon Village, after all!
I’ve been thinking about this for a while now, but just what kind of person do you all think I am? Watch it, or I’ll make you cry with my Steal. And I’m not lying. I don’t know exactly what you’re implying, but whatever you’re imagining didn’t happen.
… I-I’m talking about, you know, that… You know very well what I mean, but you’re still making me say it? That… Kissing Megumin or something… And groping her breasts…!
No, there wasn’t any kissing nor any groping. You’re looking down on me too much. Look into my eyes, does it look like I’m lying?
… Ugh. They look murky, but… It seems that you aren’t lying. My apologies, so there really was nothing. But after seeing Megumin act like that, I was sure that something had to have happened… No, it’s nothing, forget it. I’m truly sorry…
Recently, Megumin and you’ve been acting strangely. I was just worried that you two had crossed the line.
… Yeah, well I don’t want to hear that from someone who kisses other people without consent. I’m pretty normal compared to a perverted aristocrat lady.
Hey…! What are you doing, you got it all over me!
Cough! Cough! Cough! Cough…!
W-Why you! What are you saying all of a sudden? What an impudent accusation…! That’s completely… baseless…
Oh. So you got what I meant, you pervert. Of course you did, you’re the one who does all sorts of strange things while panting heavily after all! You always say things that aren’t suitable for children to hear, but when those things actually happen you get cold feet, don’t you? Hey! If you want to refute anything, then speak up!
It’s my fault. I apologize for mistakenly labeling you as a sexual harasser. Also, I’ll act more like a lady from now on, so… Please forgive me.
Oh, uh, sure… Sorry, I went too far. Let’s just forget about it…
By the way, there’s a package for you. It’s that crate beside the entrance.
Oh, so it came. I’ve been eating extravagant food full of experience points recently, so my level has gone up. That’s why I ordered some new equipment, fit for a veteran adventurer… By the way, if you keep chugging tea like that, you’ll be making friends with the toilet soon.
C-Can’t you say that more subtly…?
Oh, here it is! This looks great!
Is that a bondage rope? Th-That glow! Is it made out of mythril?
Erm… Kazuma, I’m deeply familiar with the Bind skill. So how about it? Why not try out your new rope? And now that I think about it, I don’t think I’ve ever experienced your Bind before. As fellow party members, isn’t it important that I know how powerful my comrades’ skills are?!
Didn’t you just say that you’d ‘act more like a lady from now on’? And you should be able to tell that this is for binding super strong monsters. If you want a Bind so much, just use the thinner ropes in the cabinet.
No, it has to be this one! … That is to say, this one will do. You say that it’s for use against powerful monsters, but how useful will it be if it can’t even stop me? Not very, I’d imagine. So try tying me up first.
… By the way, didn’t you just say ‘it has to be this one’?
No I didn’t.
No, you definitely did.
No I didn’t. … And that doesn’t matter now, hurry up! Are you trying to tempt me by showing off that tough, hard, and heavy looking rope?
H-Hey Kazuma, can you at least put a shirt on? Just thinking about being tied up by you in that get-up feels very unpleasant…
What the hell are you saying now?
It’ll be a hassle, but I’ll be using most of my mana to make the Bind last longer. Then I’ll throw you and your nonsense-spewing mouth off to the side.
What? So tying me up with a tough rope isn’t enough for you, you want to throw me down to the ground too?! What about the ball gag? Won’t you need one? What’ll you do if I end up screaming in pain from the bondage?
You’re disgusting, bitch.
Bind!!
What…? T-This…! Ugh… Ahhh!
… Hah, hah… Hah…! W-Why you…! Why are you always doing things that go beyond my wildest expectations…?
Hey, are you alright? I’m not sure how to put this, but I was actually holding back with that Bind…
This… Is after you held back…? Erm, Kazuma… I’ll pay you next time. I’m willing to pay, so don’t hold back.
Phew, that was exhausting. Let’s take a break. Good work, Megumin!
You say you’re tired, but weren’t you just playing with Emperor Zell the entire… Hmm?
Huff… Huff… Huff…
Kazuma and Darkness aren’t around. Where’d they go?
From what my clear eyes tell me, they must be playing board games in one of their rooms.
Hey Darkness, things only got this troublesome because you asked me to do something so weird! It’d be awkward if they saw us like this. You get that, right?
All right, let’s think about how we should handle this. Listen. I’m letting go, all right?
? Ow! Y-You…! Why’d you bite my hand, let go! That hurts, moron!
What are you doing?! Look! There’s teeth marks here!
… I can’t… Hold it… If I don’t bite something…
I want to go to the bathroom…
What did I tell you? If you drink that much tea, you’ll be making friends with the toilet!
K-Kazuma… Ka– Kazuma…! What should I do? This is bad, this is truly bad! This isn’t a joking matter anymore; this is awful…!
This is all because you didn’t listen and kept drinking tea! I’ve been thinking about this since we first met. You’re actually pretty dumb, aren’t you?! Is your brain all muscle? Seriously, sometimes you’re as dumb as Aqua!
I guess there’s no other way… Let’s get out of here and just talk things out. Megumin isn’t an impulsive moron like you, she’ll understand if we explain things to her. There’ll be less trouble in long run if we just come out now.
I want to have a nice, long chat with you about just how you see me, but that can wait. Erm… You might not know this, but I actually talk about all sorts of things when I’m alone with Megumin… A-Anyway, it’d be bad if she sees us like this, so let’s wait a bit more!
… No choice then. We’ll just have to wait a bit longer.
Hey, give me something to bite. I need to grit my teeth to endure this!
They’re not here. Putting aside the guy who revealed his hikikomori powers after the festival ended and changed jobs to trash, even the person who was supposed to be keeping an eye on him is gone.
What happened to them? It isn’t that strange for that lazy Kazuma to go loiter around somewhere, but Darkness vanishing without a word after I asked her to watch over him is strange…
… Mgh! … Mgh!
Hey, hey, what’re you doing? Don’t squirm around!
… Ah! I, I can’t…! It’s more serious than I thought…!
Come on, try harder! Those girls are just taking a break, they’ll get back to work before you know it!
Didn’t I tell you?! That’s why I said that it’d be better to just go out earlier, right?
I, I’m sorry…! B-But…!
Hey, calm down! Things will be fine if you just hold it. In the end, it’s your fault for not listening to my advice! So stay still!
Hey, don’t just close your eyes like that! Ugh, you were like this back when I sneaked into your mansion too! You give up way too easily at times like this! Listen up, I’ll explain this to you since you’re so dumb. If you charge out of the closet right now, it’s going to be really awkward. If Aqua sees you, she’ll definitely tell all the people in the guild, ‘Breaking news! A topless Kazuma and a bound-up Darkness were hiding together in a storage cabinet, drenched in sweat! I’ll let your imagination fill in the gaps!’. Yeah, something like that.
Ugh…
… H-Hey Kazuma… Even though things are like this, I’m actually enjoying holding back my bladder. Am I weird?
All right, just stop talking. Try to keep your mouth shut.
What’s going on? Megumin, how many amulets are you going to make? Are you planning to stuff Kazuma’s bag till it’s full or something?
No, these are for everyone. This one’s Aqua’s, this one’s mine… And this sturdiest one is for Darkness, who’s always protecting us with her body.
… Hey, can’t you think of a way to resolve this? Being quick-witted is one of your strong points, after all. Any ideas?
Rejoice, Darkness! The biggest problem has been solved!
…! …!!
C-Cut it out! Don’t just headbutt me with no warning like that!
Tch… You’re the one who asked if I had any ideas. I really can’t handle this aristocratic lady with too much pride…
Wait, what did you just say? I didn’t reject it because of my pride as a noble, I rejected it because I’m a woman! My pride as a woman’s something I can’t give up! Where in the world are there people who’d use this, you pervert?
In my country, some of the fiercer people who work as security in their own homes would use plastic bottles similar to this when they couldn’t leave their post.
?
– Hey Megumin. You really look happy making those; I’m feeling happy too just watching you.
Of course. These amulets all hold my wish, that everyone will stay together forever… I’m grateful to you too, Aqua. Let’s always be together.
M… Megumin! This is… I’m so touched! I understand, I can’t go back to heaven anyway, so I’ll just ditch my job as a goddess and spend my time here happily! Kazuma will deal with the issue of money somehow, so let’s play together as much as we can and enjoy our time with everyone!
So you’re still talking about goddesses and heaven? Well, fine, as long as we’re all together…
I’ll be honest; I’ve always felt that you were one erotic noble! You’ve got a slutty body and a seductive aura, but your defenses are way too strong! But even though you have such a lustful body, you’re always shy about the weirdest things! What’s wrong with you? Are you a perverted slut or a pure and innocent maiden? Make it clear! What’s with being both a virgin and a pervert you half-assed girl?!
Okay, I don’t like abusing the powers of a noble, but I’m not going to hold back against you! I’ll execute you for the crime of slandering a noble!
Go for it! Do it if you can, young lady! You’re just a Crusader who can’t even beat an Adventurer, the weakest job. Oh, so you want to rely on your daddy’s power just because you can’t beat me in a duel? Wow Lady Lalatina, you’re so cool!
Someone’s awfully cocky! As soon as those two leave, we’re dueling. I’ll kill you!
Did you actually just do that? To think an aristocratic lady would kick other people in the face, what kind of education did you have?! And even the way you speak changed, you sure are a young lady!
Ah, s-stop! Don’t push my stomach! If I can’t hold it in, you’ll suffer too!
– Hey, did you hear a knocking sound?
Really? I didn’t hear anything. Anyway, let’s get back to work. How about we finish before dinner and eat some grilled meat? The two of them should be back by then.
Sounds great to me! Summer’s barbecue season after all. And I want to drink some ice cold beer too! Let’s ask those two to buy the ingredients after they get back!
I can’t believe you out of all people are looking down on me! You’re just a meat shield whose only strong point’s her exoticness! Why don’t I tell you your sole purpose in life?!
Bring it! You always get cold feet at critical moments like this, so do it if you can!
Damn it, we wasted all that time because of something as stupid as that… What the hell are we doing…? Forget it, just go to the bathroom already… Ugh, I’m tired, I’ll go take a nap in my room.
Really, I’m the one who wasted my time here. Go and sleep then, lazy bum. After I go to the bathroom, I’ll stay in my room until the Bind wears off. And after that, I’ll be having a serious match with you. I won’t stand for being underestimated so much, understand?
P-Pardon me, Kazuma-san… Erm, I can’t use my hands to open the toilet door…
Hurry up, hurry up! Oh no, this is really bad!
What’s really bad? Be clearer.
You, you, why you little…! Doing this kind of play at a time like this. Just how accommodating are you acting for my sake…? Ah, really. It’s my fault! I was wrong, okay, so help me open the door! I’m not in the mood to enjoy this play right now!
No way around it then. Oh, but I’ll have to duel you after you solve your problem… Man, what a pain. Just the thought of it is making my hand hesitate…
… Jerk…
I went too far, sorry! Stop crying! Hey, that’s cheating, it’s cheating for a woman to cry!
… Enough. I’ll just let myself go here and then tell Megumin and Aqua all about this.
I was wrong! Really, it’s my fault! I was too arrogant and went too far! I apologized, so please forgive me!
Hey Kazuma, my underwear! Oh no, I can’t take them off! Ah damn it, this is… What should I do…?
All right, leave it to me. I’ll take them off for you.
Hey, wait, wait! …Ugh, damn it, isn’t there any other way…? Hey Kazuma, at least shut the window curtain! If it’s a little darker, it won’t be that bad…!
Sorry, but I have a skill called Night Vision…
Ugh, really, why are things so convenient for you?! But I guess that’s why you’re so reliable during crises, so thank you very much!
Steal! Kazuma, use Steal on me from across the door! Your sexual harassment-styled Steal will definitely snatch my underwear! You’ll end up seeing my underwear, but that’s much better than you reaching directly into my skirt and taking them off!
I used most of my mana on your Bind, and after casting Freeze in the storage cabinet, I’m completely out.
I take back what I said about you being ‘reliable during crises’ and my thanks! Ahhh, really, you’re so…!!
K-Kazuma! Kazuma, wait, don’t go! It, it’s not coming out…! What should I do? It’s not coming out…!
Go, go Darkness– Go, go Darkness– You can do it, Darkness–
Moron, what are you thinking?! It’s the paper! I can’t pull any toilet paper out!
I’m opening the door then!
What door?
– Really, that’s so dumb of you two… We’ve stayed together this long, you know? We wouldn’t misunderstand even if we saw that.
Ugh… I have no words…
Also…
Also. Messing around randomly like this is just our style, isn’t it?
By the way, did you make it in time?
She’s still not here yet…
Kazuma, are you there?
Oh, of course! P-P-Please come in!
P-Pardon the intrusion… By the way, this is the first time I’ve come to your room at this hour.
Y-Yeah, that’s right! Even though we’ve lived under the same roof for over a year!
I came at a time like this in order to tell you about that thing I mentioned before…
What I want to tell you is…
What you want to tell me is?!
Y-You’re too close, Kazuma! Hold on, there’s no need to rush!
I’m not anxious about this. And the distance doesn’t matter, just keep going!
What I want to tell you is… T-That’s right! I-It’s about this little guy!
… Huh?
I wanted to tell you this guy’s true identity in secret.
No you didn’t! You already came this far, you wimp! You keep talking about how incompetent I am and how I always get cold feet, but you’re a total wimp yourself!
I-I never said you were incompetent! And I really did want to tell you about this guy!
Liar! Megumin, you’re such a liar! You should be talking about something sweeter; why’d you leave me stewing in anticipation for so long?!
I never told you this before, but actually, this guy isn’t a normal cat.
I know that already! I saw this thing breath fire and fly!
… What are you talking about? It might not be a cat, but that doesn’t mean it can breathe fire or fly.
I’ve been saying it all this time, I saw it! D-Don’t look at me with pity like that! Ah, whatever, it’s fine either way!
Think carefully, isn’t there something else you want to tell me?! Hurry up and muster some courage!
Ugh…
Just say it! You’ve already said most of it, haven’t you?! You’ve already told me several times that you like me or you love me or something!
I didn’t mention love at all, don’t exaggerate!
You already did all of those things with Darkness during the day, how immoral are you?! Please just sleep with this guy for now!
You left me hanging again! Ahhh!
… Why are you staring at me? Ah, you want this? You want to drink too?
… Kazuma has become an amazing bum ever since the festival ended.
Hey Aqua, what are you talking about? I’m a successful man, okay? What’s wrong with living a life that befits my station? I’ve got so much money in the bank that I can live off of just the interest alone, you know? Doing work is stupid. I’ll go adventuring when I’m in the mood and just play the rest of the time.
Oh, I see.
What you said seems to be true. I’ll have some high class Neroid too.
… Isn’t that champagne?
It’s Neroid. There’s no carbonic acid in this world. Basically, all fizzy beverages have Neroid mixed in.
Doing your daily Explosion? Be careful on your trip. By the way, can you buy dinner on the way back? I’ll give you the money after, I want something fried tonight.
… Darkness, what should we do about this man who’s drinking wine idly so early in the morning?
… Let’s find a place and throw him out.
You people are really… I’ll make this clear: I don’t need to work anymore. Why do people work? To make money, right? But I’ve secured enough wealth to splurge my entire life. Then what’s wrong with indulging myself for the rest of my life? I’m not bothering anyone.
How pitiful… Not working because you have money? If everyone thought that way, the world wouldn’t function properly. Even if you have enough money to live for your entire life, it’s your obligation as a person to contribute to the world.
You nobles spend your days in the same way too.
H-How Insolent! Don’t look down on nobles! You might think we’re not doing anything, but the nobles are giving it their all so the people can live peacefully. You have the power to do something for the citizens too, right? Don’t just think about the money, how about doing it for the people you love? Even just defeating monsters that are a threat to humanity will be better than idling here…
Ah!
Kazuma, enough talk, let’s go. Your skills will dull if you laze around every day. Let’s go together and… T-This guy! Hey, let go! Stop resisting!
It’s fine Darkness, leave it to me… Kazuma, do show us your energetic side sometimes. Can you let me see your cool and reliable face during a crucial moment?
Huh?
… Monsters are a threat to humans, so we subjugate them when they’re discovered, but those that are beneficial to us are left alone. I hate such an arrogant way of thinking. Humans are intelligent beings; we can treat them in a gentler manner. I hope you two can remember the kindness you had when you were a child too.
Y-you were also maniacally looking for high bounty monsters back when you were in debt! Don’t just spout pretty words during such moments!
That’s right! You’ve been so keen on buying the high class food Onion Ducks because they can raise your level without any effort recently, and you dare say this now? Darkness, you pull that side! Let’s pry him away!
Hey, stick your chest closer to my back. If you do that, my hands that are holding on to the couch might loosen a little.
You’re the worst! This guy’s really the worst! Darkness, let’s tie him up and drag him to the guild!
H-How about we really find a place and dump this guy there…?
… Is this a new game? Tell me the rules.
That’s not it! We’re talking about taking on a subjugation quest together. But Kazuma’s throwing a fit and says he isn’t going… Aqua, don’t get poisoned by this man too…
Is that so? I don’t mind going, but I think it’ll be really difficult to drag Kazuma out of the mansion, now that he is in his scum hikikomori mode after the festival ended. How about leaving the Kazuma who’s the weakest and has the worst job at home and going by ourselves?
… Hey! You’ve got guts to say that, Aqua-san who has a top tier job. Think about it logically. I’m the strongest one in the team, and you’re still saying I have the weakest job? Even though it’s meaningless to compare who’s strong and who’s weak as we perform different functions in the team, it still irks me when the weakest top tier job holder says that about me.
Ara. So Kazuma, you think you’re the strongest one here? Your skills might be convenient and can take down people like Darkness easily with Drain Touch… But have you forgotten? A lich skill like Drain Touch will only work if I’m not paying attention. Do you really think you can do anything to me?
Hey wait, I’m not that weak. In order to defend against Drain Touch and magic attacks, I’ve strengthened my resistance against abnormal status and increased my magical defense…
Hey Aqua, do you think I’m a man with just one weapon, Drain Touch? She might be tough, but a mob character like Darkness who can’t land her attacks isn’t a match for me anyway. I’m the great Kazuma who can use all kinds of skills, you know? I have all sorts of spells and skills, including long distance sniping and close quarter sword attacks. Do you think you stand a chance?
Hey! Even if I can’t hit anything, I’m confident of my stamina and endurance! If I drag out the battle, I won’t lose to you…!
Ara ara. Looks like you’re misunderstanding something, Kazuma-san. My job might be an Archpriest, but with my high stats, I can take on any job I wish except for mages, okay? You can use swords and bows a little? If I cast support magic on myself and fight hand to hand with you, Kazuma won’t even last a minute. Ah, also…
I remember you learned something like Bind, right? Regrettably, only people on Darkness’s standard will be caught by that skill. I have a spell called Break Spell that can negate all magic and skills. I’ve spent a long time with you, Kazuma. Do you think your little tricks will work on me?
Hey… It’s true that I can’t move if I get hit by Bind. However, … By the way Aqua, if you can do that, shouldn’t you’ve used that spell when I was bound earlier…?
… All right, let’s have a match.
… Subjugating a pair of manticores. A request to repel a subtype of wyvern building its nest on a rocky mountain… They all lack impact…
This thing will use a weak group of monsters as bait to lure in rookie adventurers, right? We’ll compete and see who can kill the most number of goblins that are protected by this thing. Also, the one who defeats the Rookie Killer will win huge bonus points, all right? We’re already veterans… How about we show it who’s boss?
The goblins are here! I can kill an enemy of this level in a second with my God Blow!
Weren’t you helpless against the frogs in the past?
The rubbery stomach of the frogs can absorb impact. Everything in this world has compatibility, you know? Kazuma, you don’t even know that? Are you stupid?
All right. Goblin subjugation, begin!
Watch carefully, Kazuma! It’s just three goblins, I’ll finish them off easily!
Ah!
Eek?
Yah!
Hey Kazuma! What’s the meaning of killing the goblins that I was about to kill?
If I kill off the monsters you lay your eyes on first, I’ll never lose.
How despicable!
Ah, wait! I see a shadow there! You can’t escape from my eyes, Kazuma!
Stealing my prey every time! How annoying! Come out and fight properly!
Ah, I found you Kazuma! You’re just standing there motionlessly, brace yourself… Uwah!
T-There you are Kazuma! Hah… Hah… I-I’ll get my revenge today!
Serves you right!!
Darkness, let’s surround this man! Beat him up! Surround him and give him a good beating!
… We chased so hard, but we’re getting beat so one-sidedly… It’s vexing, but… I think it isn’t too bad. Am I weird…?
… Really, what are you all doing? Don’t forget about hunting goblins.
So you’re not running anymore, Kazuma? Anyway, apologize. I’ll think about how to punish you later, hikikomori dog!
Wait, we’re surrounded.
It’s here.
All right Kazuma, I’ll reluctantly cast buffing spells on you.
Don’t worry, I won’t fire into your back. I’ll be counting on you, Darkness.
I’m the one counting on you. I won’t let any of them pass; I’ll leave the attacking to you.
I’ll heal you if you’re hurt Darkness, so don’t worry! Go, we’ll definitely take out that beast this time!
this formation’s invincible
Hey Megumin. You said at the mansion earlier that you wanted to see my amazing performance and my cool side during crucial moments, right? I’ll show it to you! If we work together, no matter who the enemy…
Explosion!!
Bleh… Bleh… My mouth’s full of sand…
I couldn’t resist the Crimson Demon instincts of stealing the limelight. Now, it’s confirmed that I’m the strongest in the team, right?
You little-! I was thinking that you’ve been really docile recently, then you pull this stunt! Aren’t you the judge?
It’s a rare sight seeing you up at such an hour. What’s the occasion? Going on a quest?
I just haven’t slept yet, it’s hot nowadays after all. During such times, it’d be best if I made the room really cold and slept until evening.
I-Is that so? It’s great that you’re the same as usual. By the way, it’s the same as the time you went to that mission; recently, you haven’t done any maintenance on your weapons or armor at all. You’ve completely lost the bearing of an adventurer.
Personally, I think it’s fine even if I retire. The next step will be working as a merchant of all sorts, living an easy life from the margins I make in business.
Will it kill you to not periodically utter nonsense? I’ve never heard of anyone retiring from adventuring in their teens without taking an arrow to the knee.
Whatever. In the end, an accomplished adventurer like me will read the newspaper and take note of world events while recharging my batteries; this is for the good of the town.
Hey Kazuma, let me read it first. I just want to read the comics, I’m curious what happened to the Winter Shogun who was chasing after the abducted snow fairies in the last issue.
Wait, I’m curious about that comic too. I came downstairs just for that, all right?
‘The Demon King’s general moved to the frontlines, the battle is intensifying. The capital is in danger’–? Hey, that’s dangerous. Will my sister Iris be okay?
Don’t treat Princess Iris as your sister, impudent fool! – Crisis in the capital? Let me read that.
It seems that the forward fortress near the capital’s being attacked by a general of the Demon King’s army. The paper says that the general is an evil god that can use terrible spells.
Huh?
What’s the matter Megumin? … Ah, the term evil god must’ve tugged on your heart strings. After all, you did say something stupid about you being an evil god in your past life.
I was probably an evil god in my previous life, but that’s not what I want to talk about! It’s that I probably know that evil god…
I don’t know what this evil god is, but anyone proclaiming to be a god will receive divine retribution.
Aren’t you proclaiming to be a goddess too?
The Demon King’s general who drastically changed the battle, evil god Wolbach–
Kazuma, are you awake? The sun just rose, so you should be, right? Come, let’s go to the capital together, Kazuma! It’s now time for us to make an appearance!
… Are you acting up again? Just having a weird name and acting weirdly should be enough. What do you want to do in the capital? I’m not bragging, but it’ll be terrible if I go to the capital. I can’t say why, but if I can go to the capital, I would’ve already moved there to be near my sister.
You’re talking nonsense about your sister or something… No, forget about that. That’s right, this concerns your sister Iris! If this goes on, she’ll be in danger! Kazuma, is this the extent of your love for your sister?
I thought you didn’t get along with Iris. But that’s not actually true, is it? You’re talking about the news on the papers yesterday, huh? I’d be lying if I say I’m not worried about Iris, but the opponent is a general. Even if I go…
I’m very bothered by the general of the Demon King’s army known as an evil god. You see, didn’t I tell you about Chomusuke’s true identity last time? It’s just my gut feeling, but I think Chomusuke’s that evil god.
I just saw that evil god of yours being chased around by a chick.
I’m not asking you to fight with the Demon King’s general, Kazuma. Please, I need to resolve this. You just need to accompany me and stay by my side.
Absolutely not, why must I go to such a dangerous place? Do you really understand? Just being in the frontlines is dangerous. And on top of that, the enemy is an evil god, you know? It’s not something like the slime or undead we’ve faced. An evil god’s in the realm of final bosses.
… I know; I already knew Kazuma would say that. We did spend so much time together, after all. I’m already very familiar with this well before we took the Rookie Killer quest.
Really, it can’t be helped. How about this, if Kazuma comes with me… Um. When everything’s settled, I’ll spend a night in your room…
All right, all right. I want to sleep now; we can discuss this tomorrow.
Huh?
W-Wait. I just resolved myself and said something incredible.
… How many times did you think I had been fooled? Do you think that I’m that easy to tackle? Just like Darkness who wanted me to fight a high bounty monster with just a kiss, all of you overestimate yourselves too much.
?
Don’t think that I’m a normal virgin in puberty. You two might have the looks, but your personality’s a huge minus. If you’re aware of that, then you should provide better service.
What, you’re still holding a grudge about that night? You were so eager when I flirted with you a little recently, and you’re putting on a strong front now?
I-I-I’m not that eager, you’re just imagining it! When did I ever say I that I have a thing for you?
You’re really the worst! What do you mean by that? Did you plan to spend the night with a girl you don’t like in the slightest? You were so excited back then!
T-T-That’s not it, moron! I thought there’d be some kind of trick back then and never expected anything from the start, so don’t think too highly of yourself, you loli!
Kyouya Mitsurugi is the number three in the adventurers ranking? What kind of joke is this? That trash is ranked so high but I’m unranked? Which news company published this? I want to protest!
That’s the ranking for adventurers who’re active in the capital. It’s impossible for someone like you who shuts himself in this town to make it in. The only way to make the rankings is to be active in the front lines. How about going there to help? I’m bored with all the paperwork I’ve had to do recently and don’t mind coming along, you know?
That’s right, what Darkness said is true. You want to make the rankings? You want to be famous? Then let’s head to the battlefield and defeat the general of the Demon King’s Army!
Hey Aqua, talk some sense to these two. They said they want to protect the fortress at the frontline. We never meet anything good when we go on trips, but they’ve yet to learn this lesson. You oppose fighting the Demon King’s general, right?
I’m okay with that. The general’s troubling others, right? How could the beautiful and impartial Aqua-sama abandon the people in the mortal world who’re seeking salvation?
What’s with you all of a sudden? Normally, you’re the first one to refuse in tears when we encounter such things.
That’s only natural; monsters that can be seen anywhere don’t require my presence, right? The opponent this time is an evil god, an arrogant being that dares proclaim to be a god without even sending me a greeting. As the founder of the Axis Cult, I have to teach him a lesson.
I won’t do it, definitely not. The opponent’s always a general of the Demon King’s army, who can take on such a thing? In the end, there are tons of adventurers more powerful than us, right? Why not leave the capital to those guys? Why are you so eager to seek your death?
Don’t be so difficult; stop being stubborn and accept your fate. It’ll be fine, I’ll finish it in one shot! You don’t need to worry this time, just come along just in case!
Don’t you think our formation doesn’t have a ‘just in case’? Think about all our past experiences; if you’re sure there won’t be any problems then go! … Hey, don’t look away, look at me!!
H-Hello everyone… Um, I found this child so I brought it back…
Please have some tea.
Th-Thank you… Um, Aqua-san. This…
It might be cheap, but the tea tastes nice, right? I’ve been drinking this recently; I bought it with the allowance Kazuma gave me.
Ah… Yes, um, this is tasty…
Um, when I was taking a stroll in the park nearby, I found Chomusuke caught and being bullied by kids, so I took it into custody…
Hey, your evil god was chased by a chick, and now it’s being bullied by kids.
Y-Yunyun, you came at the right time! It’s not a big matter, but the situation’s now a little bad!
B-Bad?
Let me see… The daily serialization comic of Jack Frost’s journey. Pen pal recruitment column? Hey Megumin, could you give me this newspaper if you don’t need it anymore? Just giving me the pen pal recruitment will be enough.
Just what are you looking at? Here! Look at this article!
Hmm–? W-Wait! Megumin, this is…
Y-You’re reacting too much this time, Yunyun! The article’s not that bad!
No, I’m not overreacting at all! The evil god Wolbach is the one that was sealed in our village–
Shh! You’re too loud!
I think I heard something incredible just now.
You misheard, Kazuma. This girl will say weird things sometimes, that’s why she was ostracized in Crimson Demon village.
W-Wait! You’re the one who’s weird, Megumin! Never mind that, listen to me Kazuma-san! This evil god Wolbach was sealed in our village in the past. The seal was undone one day and Megumin willfully made that evil god into her familiar behind everyone else’s back…
S-Stop! Don’t spread the ills of the Crimson Demons, we need to subjugate the fake one that is proclaiming to be the evil god and making a ruckus in the capital, then pretend nothing happened!
Hey Darkness, use your connections to borrow that magic item which will ring when it detects a lie from the police station.
I-I’ll be right back. Ah, I hope we won’t unearth more incredulous facts…
I-I didn’t do anything wrong! Lawyer! I demand a lawyer!
All right. Please answer honestly… So, why’s the evil god Wolbach mentioned in the news?
Actually, Yunyun and I have had some run-ins with this evil god. That’s why we were concerned and researched on the evil god in the village… Wolbach seems to be the evil god that’s the patron of Sloth and Violence.
Why’s something that incredible sealed in the Crimson Demon Village?
A long time ago, our ancestors fought the evil god in an intense battle that lasted over several days and succeeded in sealing it. After that, they brought the evil god to the Crimson Demon Village to guard over it.
… Someone said ‘the place where the evil god’s sealed sounds cool’, so they wilfully kidnapped the evil god that was sealed by people in the past, resealed it in a corner of the village, and made it a scenic point.
Hey.
That doesn’t matter, we can’t do anything about the past. Now we know how the evil god was sealed in the Crimson Demon village. Anyway, why did that seal break? Who undid the seal?
It was probably the evil god who manipulated its minions to undo the seal so it could regain its original power and destroy humanity…
… My sister undid it while playing.
Wait? Hey Megumin, this is the first time I’ve heard of this!
Huh?
That’s right! The seal of the evil god was undone twice. I undid it by accident the first time, and things worked out so well because of the help of an onee-san who happened to pass by. My sister broke the seal the second time.
What is this!!
W-What are you doing? S-Stop! I’ll answer honestly, so calm down!
You Crimson Demons are always making a mess.
Megumin, Megumin, do you like the Axis Cult or do you hate it? Cecily from my church said that you have some history with the Axis Cult and might join if I push you more forcefully.
I won’t join no matter how much you pressure me! Cecily-san’s always giving me trouble and I don’t want anything to do with that mob of problematic people. If you ask me, of course I hate…
… The cultists did take care of me in the past, so I don’t really hate…
Hey Megumin, what do you think about us? Answer in terms of like or hate.
Yeah, I want to ask too. You even made amulets for everyone the other time, so how do you feel about us?
… W-What, there’s no need to answer these sort of questions… Hey, don’t look at me with such a devious smile!
Um. This little one should be the sealed evil god, but the news stated the name Wolbach, so what’s going on…?
Wait, I just heard something incredible. This thing is that evil god? Chomusuke’s the evil god?
I already told you. This little one is an evil god and also my familiar. I was wondering what the Demon King’s general is thinking, pretending to be this little one.
Hey, this cute thing here’s actually the evil god? Is the magic item broken?
Hey Kazuma, I’ve always thought that you’re a wonderful person with a gentle heart, and I’ve always felt deep gratitude for you.
Hey, what are you saying all of a sudden? Are you trying to get on my good side because my period of popularity here? Even if you compliment me so exaggeratedly, I won’t give you allowance…
No problem, the magic item’s working just fine.
All right, let’s take it outside. You’ve been looking down on me recently, looks like I need to teach you a lesson.
… Kazuma, sorry, but I need your help. Could you go with me? Actually, Chomusuke has been a kidnap target plenty of times, and I think the person in the news won’t let this go so easily. As its owner, I want to dispose of the self-proclaimed evil god calling itself Wolbach.
… Can’t you go?
You really are helpless without me!
Hey Kazuma, what’s that?
Something I bought from Wiz’s shop, a potion that’ll explode on impact.
Eh?
H-Hey… Why are you making something so scary? What do you plan to do with that?
I always thought that this was something like a potion, but it’ll explode when it touches fire too. A single drop will explode when exposed to fire, so I was thinking if this is similar to nitrates.
I can make something with this. What kind of enemy will we face at our destination tomorrow? If I can make this, it’ll become our trump card in the future.
I see, it’s summer now. The Japanese blood in Kazuma’s body is urging you to make sparklers.
It’s dynamite!
Sparklers? Dynamite? I’ve never heard of them. What are they used for?
Kazuma, look.
It shrank.
You moron!!
You…! I spent so much time making it. What did you do to it? What can I do with this? Can you turn it back? And can this still be used?
It definitely can’t be turned back.
Do you understand? I’m making this for the expedition tomorrow. You’re quite good with your hands, make one to compensate for the one you spoiled.
If I make some… For every three sticks, one will turn small, okay?
Why? Are you hiding a shrinking gun on you?
So, what exactly is this thing?
I’ll show it to you after lunch, you’ll definitely be surprised. Especially Megumin.
Time for lunch, tidy up the table and wash your hands… What’s the matter? Why’s everyone staring at me like that?
What a rare sight, everyone came along for my stroll. If I’d known, I would’ve made lunch boxes instead so we could picnic outside.
Explosion!
Ho, that’s a high score today.
Right? I think the effect’s really nice. Phew, I’m satisfied. Let’s go back… Kazuma, what’s that?
After obtaining the weapon known as wealth, I wondered if I could kill my opponent with money and tried making prototype number one. Watch carefully.
… Wait, I think that thing Kazuma made looks familiar…
Tinder!
Explosion!
Huh?
Ah… Ahhh…
A-Amazing Kazuma! When’d you learn explosion?
Humph… The hardworking me has been leveling up in secret while all of you were sleeping.
Ahhh… Ahhh…
Kazuma, Kazuma, give me one too. I want to try using Explosion.
This is a prototype; I’ll give you one after I make a dynamite with a longer fuse. I was worried and ignited it from afar.
Ahhh… Ahhh…
Fine, remember to let me play with it after you finish.
That’s fine, but the potions are expensive and the supplies are limited, so you can’t just play with it.
I-If I use that, even a Crusader like me can use Explosion? Or did you learn magic for real? H-Hey, if you make a new one, I want to try too…!
I’m Kazuma! Number one adventurer in Axel, the one who controls Explo–
Ahhhhhh!!
That thing! That thing’s not Explosion magic! The power’s only at the level of Blast magic! That thing! That… That…!
Hey, I get it. Calm down, wait! That’s just a tool, I’m kidding, kidding!
Ah, hey! It takes a lot of money and time to make one, give it back!
No! With me around, there’s no need for this thing to exist! This, this thing!
I’ll throw it away if I see that again! That’s a deviant thing! I won’t acknowledge that fake!
I know, I know, I know all right… Really, I only made this to accommodate your willfulness.
It might be useful, but no!
… Tinder!
Explosion!!
?
Weapons check, food check, equipment check! All the items are ready!
Kazuma, you were so unwilling just a while ago, yet you’re so eager now. What’s the occasion?
Because I thought about the battle this time and found that our chances are quite good.
Furthermore, Yunyun who can use Teleport will be coming along.
I-I’ll work hard! I’ll carry the luggage, make the food, keep watch at night and storm the front, I’ll do anything!
Oh, all right then, I’ll be counting on you. We’ll feel more at ease when we encounter powerful monsters during the journey if Yunyun’s with us.
Is everyone ready? Did you forget anything? I have handkerchiefs and toilet paper, just tell me if you need any!
Please calm down, we’re not kids going on a field trip.
We’ll be in your care, Yunyun. We’ll teleport to the capital first, then walk to the fortress from there. It seems that veteran adventurers can reach it in about two days. There are accommodations available along the way, so we’ll head there first.
Okay, I’ve prepared all manners of board and card games for our stay outside, so don’t worry!
Teleport!
All right, since we’re already prepared upon arrival, my original plan was for us to go straight for the frontlines. However, now that I think about it, we should collect some info on the situation from that person over there. I’ve got a plan-
Everyone here is working hard. Ah, your passion for your work is truly commendable.
Thanks. You guys are travelling adventurers, right? You’ve probably heard this already, but the capital is currently in a state of high alert due to the attacks of the Demon King’s army. Anyway, don’t just stand there. If you’re entering the capital then hurry up and come in.
Oh, you came here to help? … Though I am truly moved, will you be fine on the frontlines with your gear? The enemies gathered near the fortress are all elite troops of the Demon King’s army, you know?
Hey, hey, I’ll feel troubled if you evaluate me so lightly. I might not look the part, but I have the accomplishment of defeating a Demon King’s general… My name is Satou Kazuma, you’ve at least heard of this name before, right?
Huh? What are you saying, a man like you…?
Hey, wait a second! I don’t recognize this man, but I’ve seen the people behind him before!
That’s right! I’ve heard of that great mage who swept away the Demon King’s army with Explosion Magic!
Wait, that’s Dustiness-sama! Dustiness-sama who was able to take the blows of a battalion of monsters is here!
I’ve seen that blue-haired priest before! When the Demon King’s army attacked a while ago, she cast powerful support magic and healed all the wounded!
It seems that you know your stuff. Yes, we’re…
Ah, I remember you! You’re the guy that was hacked to death by kobolds!
Yeah. Now that you mention it, I remember now. You’re the guy that embarrassingly charged in front and got surrounded and mobbed by kobolds!
You’re way too weak, don’t even think about coming to a place like this. There is a faraway town called Axel that is known as the gathering place for newbie adventurers. Why don’t you go there and level-up a bit first?
The monsters around here are all really strong. By the way, are you their servant or something? Even if you’re just a porter, you need to have decent strength.
As you can see, we’re a strong adventurer party. Besides me, the leader, the party is composed of an Arch Priest, a Crusader, and two Archwizards. It’s a rather luxurious group, isn’t it?
Ah, that’s pretty amazing! … Hey, if I may ask, what job do you, the self-proclaimed leader have?
… Humph. Right now we’re going to go help the nearest fortress, but we’re not sure how to get there. That said, if there are any adventurers or soldiers going to the fortress, please allow us to accompany them. Of course, since they’re leading the way for us, we won’t charge any protection fees, so you can be rest assured.
It is extremely regrettable, but I’d not recommend going there. The enemy general’s siege on the fortress has been relentless. Currently, wounded adventurers are falling back every day, and his majesty the king, and the crown prince–whom were fighting in the frontlines–have been forced to retreat for the sake of their safety. In this kind of situation, no one would willingly go to the fortress.
What-?
Even though no one can bring you there, as a compromise, I can give you a map that shows you the location of the fortress, as well as the distribution of monsters in the area. I’d usually stop other adventurers from going, but with a party like yours, you shouldn’t have any problems getting there. Good luck! Your name is Satou Kazuma, right? I’ll tell the adventurers and the townspeople that ‘a brave adventurer party led by Satou Kazuma has left for the frontlines’!
… Huh?
I’ll leave it to you to help my comrades that’ve been struggling on the frontlines!
Yeah! We saw how you repelled the Demon King’s army last time! You guys can do it!
All right, I’ll go to town to spread the news! Everyone will be overjoyed!
Well then, we’ll leave this to you!
Ah, ok.
… Look, after talking to them, I managed to get a map to the fortress and the information about monsters.
Well that is a surprise, I didn’t think Kazuma was this enthusiastic. Well then, let’s go!
Oh, if anyone is hungry, please tell me, I brought a lot of snacks! Also, since I know elementary-level magic, I can create clean water, so if you’re thirsty you can tell me as well. Ah, Megumin stop! Don’t go there, that path looks like it is about to collapse.
Why are you so naggy? Are you a child going camping for the first time? We have a long walk ahead of us today, so if you keep this up, you’ll be really tired later.
What are these light and fluffy things? I’ve never seen them in Axel.
… Hmm? Hey Aqua, they’re fairy-type creatures called Kesaran Pasaran. They’re completely harmless, so just ignore them…
Kesaran Pasarans are a subtype of snow-fairies, so if you bully it too much, their guardian will show up.
Hey Megumin, are you sure it was a good idea to bring it along?
You’ll understand when we get there. In other words, this thing will help us subjugate the Demon King’s army general.
Ah. Hey Aqua, it’s dangerous to hold onto it any longer, just let it go already.
Just let me rub it a little while longer. I’ve been away from Emperor Zell for a long time and this thing reminds me of him.
Didn’t you part with Emperor Zell this morning?
Stop right there, adventurers! This path is under our control! Leave your money and luggage here!
Kazuma, it’s bandits! It’s my first time seeing actual bandits! In this world filled to the brim with monsters, there are actually people who take up such a useless way of life!
Kazuma, Kazuma! The mob that’s rarer than onion ducks–bandits–have appeared!
Bandits have really appeared! Even though I travel a lot on my own, this is the first time I’ve encountered actual living bandits! When I return to the Crimson Demons Village, I’ll brag to everyone about this!
Hey, are you guys looking down on us? Hurry up and hand over your money!
Just looking at you people, I can clearly tell that you people haven’t had a bath in forever and reek of disgusting body odor! I’m not sure if it’s due to the abstinent lifestyle in the mountains, but your gazes are also filled with lust! You imbecile bandits who’d ravish weak girls with all your might, my name’s Dustiness ford Lalatina! As a female knight, I won’t let you do as you please!
Dustiness…?
Hey, hey, did she just say Dustiness?
Dustiness as in the noble house Dustiness? Now that I think about it, she has blonde hair and blue eyes… Isn’t that evidence of her noble heritage?
You said to leave our luggage and money. But you bastards won’t be satisfied by just that, will you? I can tell just by seeing your gazes… Once we remove our battle equipment you’ll say things like, ‘Hey, aren’t these girls quite nice? We’ll be able to fetch a high price for them…!’.
Of course it won’t end there! You’ll say things like, ‘Boss, before we sell the goods, why don’t we try them out?’ with a dirty smile! Then the person over there that looks like your boss will say, ‘Oh, of course. Is there a reason not to try out our high quality products…?’ … Hey, what is it? Why are you suddenly running? What’s your intention?
If there are nobles here, then that means there are knight squadrons nearby! Hurry up and run!
Those red eyes, they’re Crimson Demons!
Hey, hey wait! There are a bunch of young girls here! Are you sure you’re fine with this? Also, there are no knights here! Wait, wait! What about your pride as bandits…?
We’re in such a mess because you didn’t let those people go.
Ah, b-but as a knight I can’t turn a blind eye to those that harm the masses…
I also wanted to fight those bandits. If we defeat such a rare mob, lots of money will drop for sure.
Hey, don’t call bandits a mob.
By the way, who’ll keep watch for tonight? The monsters around here are really dangerous.
Ah, p-please leave it to me. I have confidence in my stamina, so everyone else can take a rest.
Darkness-san, this camping atmosphere has made me really excited! There’ll be no problems! Please leave it to me!
… Don’t stay up late, all right? After all, you were probably really excited about our journey and didn’t sleep last night, right?
H-How do you know that?
Just let me do it, all right? I have the Enemy Detection and Night Vision skills, and I’m a night owl anyway. Put out the fire after dinner so that we won’t be noticed by monsters.
Sorry Kazuma, because of my stupid actions…
Of course, If you really feel bad about it, don’t chase after some random old men again.
No problem. I lost my composure because bandits–who’re the enemy of all female knights–appeared. I’ve prepared myself. In the future, I’ll only allow myself to be led around by a specific person.
Hey, I don’t get what you mean, but I feel like I’d be better off not knowing.
Hey, there’s something coming! It seems to be an undead… Hey, get up! Aqua, Aqua!!!
Hey, hurry up and wake this idiot up! Also, for some reason I can’t make out the silhouette of the enemy with my Night Vision. Just light up the surroundings!
Aqua, Aqua! Get up, an undead is here!
I’m sleepy… Could you just tell them to let me go for today…?
Hey, useless livestock, get out of bed already! They’re here for you, so get up and do something! Tinder!!
Ah-! W-W-W-W-W-What…? What, what, what’s this…?
How could it…? Why in a place like this…?
… H-Hurry up and w-wake Aqua up…!
–!!
The walking corpse of a dragon! There’s no better adversary for a Crusader! The three of you, back away!
–!!
Aqua–!! Aqua-sama–!! It’s a dragon!! A bone dragon’s appeared! Hurry up!! I beg you, please do something about it–!!
Hmm… It’s just a bone dragon… Let Emperor Zell deal with it…
Stop dreaming and get up or you’ll become bone dragon food!
Turn Undead–!
Darkness! Please Darkness! Your injuries aren’t deep, so open your eyes!
Megumin, don’t shake her! I-I-In times like these, we have to stay calm!
Hehe, how could a mere bone dragon be my worthy opponent? Kazuma, praise me however you wa– Ahhh–!
W-Wait, what are you doing? Doing this when I can’t resist, are you looking for a fight?
It’s because I don’t want to give you time to resist! Just look at Darkness! It’s your fault that the bone dragon showed up! Just get up when we tell you to get up! Give me some of your energy to make up for mine when I stayed up all night to keep watch!
What? W-Why should I? Didn’t you just ambush me? I won’t let you drain energy from me ever again. Here, I’ll let you try, but not even a real lich can drain from me!
Heal–! … Well, as expected of Darkness. Even though a dragon’s signature breath attack can’t be used after they become undead, their physical limits are removed. So basically, a bone dragon’s physical attacks are more powerful than living dragons.  I’m surprised she wasn’t reduced to paste when she took on the bone dragon’s attacks head on.
Damn, the monsters have noticed our presence because of the light and noises from the fight. My Enemy Detection is showing a huge return signal. We don’t have a choice, let’s move somewhere else. I’ll take Darkness’s and your luggage, so Aqua, carry Darkness.
What? You’re asking me to carry Darkness? She’s really heavy with her armour on. Also, are we going to walk around in the dark?
Cast some strength enhancing magic on yourself. With your high stats besides luck and intelligence, you should be able to easily carry her if you cast it. Cast a buff on me too while you’re at it. It’s already hard to carry three people’s worth of luggage with my abilities, so there’s no way I can carry Darkness. Megumin and Yunyun will hold my hands and we’ll proceed using my Night Vision. Be careful not to trip.
By the way, even without armor, isn’t Darkness rather heavy? Also, she was bitten by the bone dragon so she smells really bad…
… That’s because Darkness’s body is full of muscles, don’t tell her that though.
Ah, this reminds me of the time when Kazuma and I went to that dungeon a while ago. If I remember correctly, Kazuma tried to touch my butt in the darkness.
Hey, if you’re going to make groundless accusations, I’ll leave you here alone.
Even though we just encountered a bone dragon and barely escaped a group of monsters, I can’t help but feel reassured. While we can’t be called a powerful party, I feel that as long as we stay together, we can overcome anything.
How great… When will I be able to encounter companions like Kazuma-san’s group?
That’s impossible. After all, Yunyun needs to be able to make friends first.
?
H-Hey, don’t diss people at a time like this!
So the living accommodation here is a hot-spring inn… When I think of hot-springs, I can’t help but remember the time where we went to Alcanretia.
Yes. Back then, Kazuma tried to eavesdrop on us when we entered the bath.
K-Kazuma-san, did you really do that…?
Hey Kazuma, the bath here’s probably a mixed-bath, so could you wait till we’re done to go in? I feel like my chastity is at risk.
That’s merely wishful thinking; Even I have the right to choose, you know?
Let’s go. There aren’t many people who’d come to a hot-springs inn out here, so we probably have the place all to ourselves.
I’ll go first! Actually, why don’t we all wash together?
I don’t mind.
Wait, didn’t Aqua ruin the hot-spring in Alcanretia? Aqua, could you go in last?
Hmm, all right. Taking a bath last is pretty enjoyable you know; after all, being able to take my time is one of the merits of a vacation.
T-T-Taking a bath… With everyone…
Well then, would you rather take a bath with me?
We’ll finish quickly; after that you can take your time in the bath. After all, you seem to take a long time to bathe.
Well otherwise, if you’d like to, I can scrub your back like I did before…
What are you guys saying? Did you eat something wrong? Even though there’s a saying that states where people become really open when they’re travelling, you guys should think it through first. If you say such suggestive things, then what are you going to do when I say ‘Well sure!’ …?
I’m fine with that. When do you want to go to the bath?
Sure, if you really have the guts to do it, I’ll scrub your back whenever.
Then let’s go, Kazuma.
… Eh? Why, and here I was thinking who it was. It’s you again. Do you still remember this onee-san? We met in the hot-springs at Alcaretia…
I’ll kill you!!
Huh, what?
Ah, this hot spring is quite nice. Also, could you not act so scared of me? I was just a bit frustrated that my ‘moment of clarity’ had been wasted. I thought that one of my companions was in the bath…
I-Is that right? Also, it’s perfectly normal for me to be scared of you. After all, you declared your intention to kill me even though this is practically the first time we’ve met. How should I say this? Your eyes were totally serious and I could feel the murderous intent from all the way here…
Well… Now that I think about what onee-san said… If I remember correctly you’re that teary-eyed onee-san whose breasts I stared at, right? Of course I remember you, they’re big, after all.
Um, I, … Even though this is the second time we’ve met, you’re able to say ‘they’re big’ without any hesitation… Isn’t this sexual harassment…?
No, I’ve decided. From now on I’ll no longer hide my true self. I won’t avert my gaze nor will I resist my urges. I’ll live life my own way.
Even though what you said sounds good, in this situation, I can’t help but think that I’m in a crisis…
By the way, why are you in a place like this? You said you were an adventurer, but aren’t there a lot of powerful monsters here? Though saying this is a show of bad manners, you don’t look very strong… Will you be fine?
There’s no problem. Even though I’m really weak, there’s a reliable Crimson Demon with us. Anyway, I didn’t want to come to this place, but my companions wanted to… So… Why’s onee-san in this place?
Me? … Well, I guess that’s true. After working hard every day without rest, to reward myself, I came to my favorite hot spring. Also, I’m looking for an important companion that can’t be found that easily…
Important companion? So you came to find your lover?
No, it’s not a lover… Hmm, more accurately, I’m looking for my partner, a part of myself that was sealed away somewhere… Well, at this point I feel like giving up.
Give up on what? One of my companions is a bit weird, like there’s something wrong with her head… No, she’s a person of special circumstances… Do you want to discuss it with her? She’s here as well.
Ah… Is that person a Crimson Demon? I’m not that type of weird person, so don’t worry.
Eh, is that right? Well then, I can listen to your problems I guess. If you don’t mind, could you tell me about it?
You’ll listen to my complaints? Hmm. Somewhere in the Crimson Demon village, something like my other half or companion or evil god… Basically, my partner who’s a black cat was sealed in a gravestone.
When it was released with me, it accumulated intense grudge and was too hard to keep under control, so I allowed it to slumber a little longer… But when I went back to check on the situation, the seal had already been released and my partner had been taken by someone.
… I’m just a bit curious, but is your partner a black cat that can fly and breath flames?
Sorry, but I don’t understand what you mean.
Well, my Crimson Demon companion proclaims that her pet black cat’s an evil god.
… A black cat raised by a Crimson Demon? And that person called the cat an evil god? It sounds a bit chunni though…
Um, hmm, well that’s all there is… Well anyway, that person said that she was a god of destruction or something in her previous life, so there’s no need to take her seriously.
I-Is that so? If you don’t mind me asking, is that black cat…? Right, does it like lazy people?
… I don’t think so? I think that that cat’s the closest to me, and I don’t think I’m really lazy at all. I put in the most effort in my entire party and I’m fairly certain I have the most common sense as well.
It’s so timid that a newborn chick was chasing it around.
Thanks, that’s enough. It’s not the one I’m looking for.
Then I’ll be going. This place is close to the front against the Demon King’s army, and the security is lacking to the extent where I encountered the rare existence known as bandits on my way here. You’re better off going back to the capital, all right?
… How should I say this? I can’t really explain it, but I don’t want to treat onee-san like a stranger. I don’t really get this strange feeling… Ah, no. I’m not trying to hit on you or anything like that, ok?
This… Um, what a coincidence. To me, you don’t feel like a stranger either. That’s why I’m giving you some advice to get away from here as quickly as possible… After all, there’s the chance you encountered my other half and have taken good care of it.
… Crap, I didn’t ask for onee-san’s name!
Kazuma, you seem to be in a good mood. You stayed in the bath for a long time yesterday. Did something happen?
I guess something happened. When I went into the hot spring yesterday, I encountered a beautiful onee-san that I met before in Alcaretia.
Oh, huh? I suppose that’s pretty good. By the way, did you meet in the mixed bath?
Yeah. Hmm, now that I think about it, they were quite big. They were probably even bigger than Darkness’s.
What are you saying all of a sudden? If I leave my eyes off you for a moment, something like this happens… But isn’t a solitary young girl at a fortress checkpoint a bit suspicious?
Um, that person was fine after encountering bandits? It’s probably the same group of bandits that we saw yesterday. If it’s a beautiful onee-san, then she shouldn’t have been able to get away…
Eh, despite your honest appearance, you have such perverted fantasies.
Wait, isn’t it normal to think that way if we’re talking about bandits? Also, I don’t want to be called a pervert by Megumin of all people! Haven’t you already taken a bath and shared a bed with Kazuma-san?
Hey! It’s fine if I say it myself, but it’s embarrassing for someone else to say it, so shut up!
… Ah, they’re big.
?
It’s huge~
Did those guards say that this fortress’s falling to a mere Demon King’s general? Even if it’s a general, I doubt that it can be done.
That’s what I thought, but a Demon King’s general is said to be able to destroy an entire city on its own. In another sense, what’s abnormal is how we were able to defeat them so easily.
Adventurers, this is the fortress of the frontlines tasked with repelling the Demon King’s army, what brings you here?
We heard that the capital of the nation was under threat, so we came to support the fortress. We have a lot of top-tier jobs, so we thought we’d be useful here.
Top-tier jobs…? I see, then allow me to thank you for your help. However, first I’d like for you provide proper identification. We need your cooperation with this since there’s a Demon King’s army general hiding around here. So first is…
… Megu-, Megumin-san, right?
Yes, that’s my name, you got a problem?
No, no! None at all! Please excuse my behavior, you can come in… And you’re… Yunyun-san?
Y-Yes… That’s my name… I’m Yunyun…
Hey, from the beginning, you seem to have some misgivings about our names. Let’s hear them, shall we?
No, there’s no problem, please excuse my behavior! Then next is… Satou Kazuma. Satou, Kazuma?
Satou Kazuma! Are you that dirty rascal, Satou Kazuma? You’re that person who planted devious ideologies in Iris-sama’s mind and gave Claire-sama and Rain-sama a lot of trouble. You’re the atrocity that was driven out of the castle–!
Hey, wait a moment.
I’m extremely sorry. Um, this is an important checkpoint for defending the nation from the Demon’s King army, so we can’t allow some nameless stranger to enter…
Didn’t you just describe me in detail?
So you’re that dirty scum called Satou Kazuma, huh? You’re only a petty adventurer, so what kind of attitude do you think you’re showing? I have the authority to execute any suspicious people here, you know? You’re just a dirty lowlife adventurer, so get the hell out of here!
What do you think you adventurers are doing? You want to fight us, huh?
Know your place, do you not know who this esteemed lady is? She’s the daughter of the Dustiness family, Dustiness ford Lalatina-sama!
What?
Why are you two kneeling as well?
Ah, my bad. It happened so suddenly that I was caught up in their pace…
I-I didn’t know that Darkness-san was a noble…
A-A-Are you really Lady Dustiness…? Um, please forgive me for my insolence and my failure to recognize your greatness…! … Ah, then please allow us to confirm your identity… It’s not that I suspect you, just that this is part of the job…
P-P-Please excuse my insolence! Not only did I fail to recognize Lady Dustiness, but I even showed such disgraceful etiquette toward these esteemed man and ladies!
Humph, that’s barely enough of an apology! Ah! When I think about how I was about to be viciously slashed, I can’t help but feel shaken and hurt to my core. That was an incident that’ll forever be a mental scar.
AUGH! When I think about what just happened, my heart feels as if it’ll explode…!
That won’t do! Ah, what kind of attitude was that? To think you would show such disgraceful behavior toward the followers of Lalatina ojou-sama!
Hurry up and apologize! Toward us who you were planning to attack a second ago, please say ‘I’m very sorry!’!
S-Sorry, I’m very sorry. For such insolence toward Lady Dustiness and her subordinates, the punishment should be suicide by sword… But, um…
No no, we won’t ask for so much, after all, you were just doing your jobs. Anyhow, we’re tired after a long day’s trek, so we won’t ask too much of you. That said, could you prepare an accommodation that we can use during our time here?
Of course! We’ll provide Lady Dustiness and her followers the best rooms available here!
Hey Kazuma. There are mysterious buttons and control sticks everywhere, it’s like they want me to press them.
They definitely want you to press them. Or rather, it would be strange for you not to press them when they are right beside your hand.
Did you people barge in here to mess around!? This is the control stick for the drawbridge, main gate, and traps, you absolutely cannot press them! You hear that? Absolutely not!
Since you said this much, it would be a shame if I don’t press them. First will be the button inside that glass cover…
That is the self-destruct button for when we need to abandon the fort, please don’t press it! Don’t press… Didn’t I tell you no?! Get out!
We got chased out again. The people here are all very high strung.
It’s a fort at the frontlines, everyone is really tense.
It can’t be help. I think there is a free cookhouse, let’s freeload over there.
That sounds great, should I bring the wine in my luggage over?
Aqua-sama!? Aren’t you Aqua-sama!?
Isn’t that Katsuragi? It’s been a while.
It’s Mitsurugi! Did you say it wrong on purpose!? Remember my name properly!
Aqua-sama, long time no see! You look well and energetic…
Yes, I’m always full of life. Magic sword guy, are you doing well? By the way, where are the two harem girls that follow you around?
Harem girls!? No, well, since the battle is going badly, it would be dangerous for them to stay here, so I had them retreat back to the capital… That’s right!
Satou, why did you bring Aqua-sama to such a dangerous place? Do you know where this place is!?
I know. This is the foremost frontline in the war against the Demon King Army. The Demon King’s general will attack this place periodically, right?
We are here to help you hardworking people. The opponent proclaimed to be an evil god, right? Then it is time for me, a goddess, to do my part.
Aqua-sama wants to fight that woman!? T-This is… It’s true that Aqua-sama might be able to contend with her, but that woman is dangerous. She almost took down the fort by herself.
The Demon King general is a woman, huh… even though the opponent proclaimed to be an evil god, there are several Japanese with cheat abilities here, right? And you, the magic sword user who lost to me but is more powerful than most people is here. Although you did lose to me, the enemy is but one person, so why are you all having a hard time?
Stop nagging about me losing, you’re the one who refused my rematch… Forget it, there’s a reason why we’re being pushed to the brink. Didn’t you see that?
From your face, you probably didn’t. You’re free, right? Let me show you something nice.
Hey, could that be…
Yes. The Demon King’s general, Wolbach, can use explosion magic.
Alright. Let’s start deciding our future plans.
What future plans? I just met the commander of this fort and told him we have experience in defeating a number of Demon King generals, so he relinquished his command authority to us.
No, actually, that general named Wolbach can use explosion magic.
!?
Explosion!? T-This is beyond my expectations… Thanks to Megumin, I know the might of this spell very well. To be honest, I don’t know how to defend against it…
It’s fine, leave it to me! I took the full brunt of an explosion before! I will be the bait. When the enemy shows an opening after casting her spell, use the chance to overwhelm her.
You don’t have your armour right now. Even with Aqua’s buffing spell, there’s no guarantee that you will be safe.
That’s how it is. Even though we made a trip here, I think we should let that person proclaiming to be an evil god off. I am not being lenient, just that I have never heard about a minor evil god named Wolbach before; she is rather pitiful, right?
I am Megumin! The number one mage in Axel, the one who pursues the ultimate explosion spell! The Demon King general who claims to be an evil god and is a user of explosion magic…!? That’s the worthy rival I’ve been looking for!
Huh!?
What do you mean by ‘huh’, only a user of explosion magic is worthy of being my rival. It would be just what I wished for if I die from her explosion magic! Yes, I would have no regrets if I go out in such a grand way!!
What nonsense are you saying!? Aren’t I Megumin’s rival!? Why did you promote a Demon King general you’ve never met before to a rival so easily!?
W-Why are you suddenly freaking out!? What a troublesome child, if you want me to acknowledge you as my true rival, then learn explosion magic. I will then take you along for my stroll every day.
I don’t want to learn explosion magic, and I’m fine even if you go on that kind of stroll without me! Our opponent this time can use explosion! Such an opponent…
How dare you say you don’t want to learn explosion!? Alright, I will treat this as a challenge against me and accept it! It’s been awhile since our last duel. If you lose, you will save your skill points until you can learn explosion!
I-I don’t want such a duel! A duel that will decide the course of my life, I will never… Wait, Megumin, your eyes are turning red! Are you serious!? Hey, are you really serious!?
Megumin did say some foolish things, but the enemy this time is still too dangerous. We might get wiped out with just one shot. If we get blasted to dust, Aqua’s resurrection magic won’t work. So let’s withdraw…
What the hell are you saying!? How can I run before such an opponent!? This is my destined rival, yes, there is no doubt about it!
The one who is targeting my familiar Chomusuke is the user of explosion magic, the Demon King general proclaiming to be an evil god! There is no other way but for me to defeat Wolbach, and take over her title of general and evil god!
What are you going on about… The risk is too high this time. We would be at a disadvantage if this turns into a gamble where the first one to attack wins.
There is no disadvantage at all. The spell I like is explosion magic. My hobby is explosion magic. If you talk about me, it’s explosion magic. That’s right, I am the explosion magic user from Axel. Ever since I learned this spell, I have been using it every day without fail. Be it speed, accuracy, or destructive power, I am confident that no one in this world is better at explosion magic than me!
Didn’t you lose to Wiz when we fought the Destroyer?
That’s history now. Since I’ve leveled up, I learned all sorts of skills related to increasing the power of explosion magic. Wiz and I compared the power of our explosion spells some time ago and won. I am the number one in Axel right now.
It will be fine. When I couldn’t sleep at night, I will chant explosion magic until I doze off. No matter who my opponent is, I will finish my incantation before them!
What the hell!? You did something so dangerous!?
Ugh, that tremor is quite powerful. Adding the mana wavelength that was released before the spell was cast, this is definitely a well executed explosion. This spell wasn’t learnt to show off or during a moment of stupidity.
Why are you giving an evaluation?
Anyway, hurry up Megumin. Now is the chance to defeat the attacking Demon King general!
Huh? W-What’s with you Kazuma? Your attitude flipped 180 degrees.
Since she cast explosion just now, it means she won’t be able to cast explosion again today.
Ah!
How terrible.
Hey, where did the Demon King general go? Wouldn’t it be easy to defeat her since she’s out of mana?
Wolbach is long gone… This is the reason why we are having so much trouble. The evil god Wolbach will show up suddenly, cast explosion from afar, then retreat via teleport before we can get near her.
The elites of the Demon King Army are standing by in the forest near the fort. She probably escaped there, and will return after recovering her mana. Not only do they have great numbers, the forest is the home ground of the monsters. With the opponent having the advantage of terrain, we will definitely lose if we fight outside the walls of the fort. But if we keep on defending the fort, once the outer wall is completely destroyed, the elites that had been standing by will use the chance to launch an attack.
We can only do something if either Wolbach or the Demon King Army elites are gone…
—— Okay, let’s escape.
It’s decided then. I will make a bed for Emperor Zell after going back to Axel. One that is more comfortable than that evil husk, a high quality bed Emperor Zell would be happy with. It’s fine, the likes of Demon King generals will be killed in an instant after Emperor Zell grows up.
W-Wait Kazuma, I have been forced to take command of this fort. If I say ‘I’m quitting and going home’, it would be a little…
Why did you take on such a troublesome job in the first place!?
It’s your fault for using my name to intimidate them!
Hmm? Where did Yunyun go? Wasn’t she with us just now?
If you are looking for Yunyun, she is using magic to help with the repairs of the outer walls.
I see, as expected of a capable Crimson Demon. I will check if anybody is hurt.
Do tell me who the ‘incapable’ Crimson Demon is.
Aqua and Yunyun are helping in their own way. Amazing, as expected of veteran adventurers. Hey Kazuma, we are already veteran adventurers, right?
Hey Kazuma… I know this is dangerous, but can you give me a chance? Everyone can just wait in the fort. I will wait for Wolbach who might show up anytime, and throw an explosion into her face once she appears.
… I have Enemy Detection, Farsight and Lurk skills, so the chance of our ambush working will increase if I go with you. I will just accompany you, but it will be up to you when the enemy shows up.
Leave it to me!
The Demon King Army is already this close.
According to the people in the fort, Wolbach comes alone when she uses explosion magic. I came up with a plan around this point.
First, we will use my Lurk skill to sneak into the vicinity. Megumin will cast her spell before they notice us. If the other party detects us, Yunyun will use refraction magic to conceal Megumin, and Aqua will cast support spells to buff Darkness, who will then rush forth to get their attention. Aqua and I will cover Darkness and create an opening. When Megumin feels that the time is right, you can fire your spell at the enemy… Does everyone understand?
Kazuma Kazuma, I think someone needs to protect this little one. How can we expose such a small and cute creature to danger… Hey, that hurts. You’re fine with everyone else, so why do you keep scratching me?
Alright, we’re all set. We just need to wait for that bitch Wolbach to come.
Hey Kazuma, my legs are wobbly.
Weren’t you bragging before we set off?
What an annoying tactic. Can’t she just face us in a proper fight?
If that general heard what you said, she will definitely say ‘I don’t want to hear that from you’.
Hey Megumin, start quietly chanting your spell now. There is no need to talk to the enemy, just finish this with a pre-emptive strike.
You just talked about a proper fight a moment ago. What a sly tactic… but never mind, I will listen to you this time. I have to try to avoid letting Darkness tank an explosion spell.
She found us! Megumin, chant your spell openly! Shoot it in her face before she can cast hers!
Leave it to me, Kazuma!
Hya, what’s wrong Chomusuke!? Why are you writhing about all of a sudden!?
Darkness, Aqua! Stall for time!
Hey Kazuma, I should stay behind in case of an emergency. After all, no one can revive the party if anything happens to me! You hear me!?
Stop blabbering and follow me! I will be blown to smithereens if I get hit by explosion anyway. This wasn’t part of my plans, but the only one who can rival a self-proclaimed evil god would be you!
… What’s the matter? You looked surprised to see us. Are you feeling afraid after seeing me, who is famous in the Demon King Army?
Maybe she is surprised after seeing your weird and funny face.
… What are you doing here?
That should be my line. Aren’t you that Onee-san who likes to bathe?
By the way, I haven’t introduced myself. My name is Wolbach, one of the generals of the Demon King Army. The patron goddess of sloth and violence, Wolbach.
… Well, I actually didn’t know that Onee-san is related to the Demon King Army. But I have something to ask you. You don’t look like a bad person to me. Why did you become a Demon King general?
Why, you say? According to tradition, this should be my reply, right?
—— If you want to know, you will have to defeat me.
—— Hey, even though you said such deep words and built a mysterious atmosphere, I still have to cut you off here. I could sense some godly aura from you, but the patron goddess of sloth and violence? If you’re not honest, I will sue you for bending the truth. Just say that you are an evil god.
I might govern sloth and violence, emotions with unfavourable impressions, but I’m still a proper goddess. I’m not exaggerating.
You’re lying! Hey Kazuma, this woman is talking nonsense! The goddesses that are officially recognized in this world are just Eris and me! Apologize! Proclaiming to be a goddess and sullying the name of pure, beautiful, and respectful real goddesses; apologize for doing that!
Hey, what are you saying all of a sudden!? I am a proper goddess, it’s just that after I joined the Demon King Army, the crazy Axis cultists called me an evil god on their own, so I had no choice but to roll with it! And I don’t need a priest I never met before to lecture me on that!
You say my devotees are crazy!? How dare you treat the world renowned Axis Cult like idiots; are you really a god? Do you have any believers? Puhehe, I have never heard of a minor god called Wolbach!
H-How dare a mortal insult a god! Don’t think you can get away with this! A priest like you should treat other gods with respect!
Mortal? You say I’m a mortal? I’m calling you out on proclaiming to be a goddess because your eyes are blind!
I am Aqua. That’s right, the goddess of water worshipped by the Axis cult! A mere minor god that I have never heard of before dares to lecture me? Know your place!
Huh!?
… You will receive divine retribution if you impersonate a goddess, you know?
Apologize! Apologize for that right now!
Hey, stop that, you impudent fool, I will give you divine punishment! I will make you roll around tiredly in bed on your precious day off and waste your vacation!
Try it if you dare! I will curse your toilet to not flush even though there is someone waiting for you outside!
Goddesses don’t use the bathroom, so that won’t scare me!
I live every day like a holiday, so I’m not afraid of you!
Hey Kazuma, can we leave them alone?
I’m of the same mind, but the opponent is still a general, so we can’t ignore them…
Seems like I have to let you have a taste of the prowess of a water goddess when she gets serious! How dare an evil god like you act so haughtily! You don’t even have devotees who are pure, just, and free like mine!
A, a retard like you is really the goddess of water? But it’s your problematic believers’ fault that I am called an evil god! I have believers in the Demon King Army too!! And you are just a super minor god compared to Goddess Eris anyway!!
Sacred Create Water!
Tel, Teleport!!
There’ll be no problems this time. Please let me do it!
Will you really be fine? What was up with you yesterday…? Was it because the enemy looked like a human? I mean, I understand how you feel. I can’t attack such a beautiful onee-san without hesitation either…
To me, it doesn’t matter if the enemy is a human or a child. As long as they provide a large amount of experience points, I will attack without remorse, but…um…
I don’t really know too much about your situation, but we can’t rely on an ambush anymore. Our target will be more cautious from now on, thanks to a certain idiot who dumped water on her. Anyway, even though the fortress walls weren’t struck by explosion magic, it still received damage.
…Is that so…? Well, if there’s anything you need help with, please feel free to call me. Even though I say that, my only strength is explosion magic…
We still need to make a plan with everyone, so just take it easy-
We need some help here! Go call someone who knows earth magic or golem summoning magic! We need to reinforce the walls before they collapse!
There’s not even a trace of her here… She probably used teleport again to escape and buy herself time to recover her magic power.
—Ah! Hey, what happened here!? Why does the wall look worse than before!?
…What’s with this costume, Aqua?
What do you mean by ‘What’s with this costume’? Kazuma told me to participate in the fortress repairs, so I went to prepare…But then what happened here!? Who did such a terrible thing to our work!?
It was that evil god from yesterday. Didn’t I already tell you that she was the one destroying the fortress walls? Well, since you’ve already spent the effort to dress up, hurry up and go help everyone with the repairs over there.
Wait a second! You can’t do it like that! When constructing a wall, you need to first consolidate the foundation and then create an embankment around it. After that, use the plaster to reinforce the connections. So first, do it like this, and then this. Finally, it should be like this!
How are you so fast!? And this quality…!? Hey, wait a sec!? What’s happening here!? Since when did you learn such high-level construction skills!?
Who do you think I am? When I told the construction boss ‘I have adventurer work to do, so I’m not going to work anymore,’ he went down on his hands and knees to beg me to give up working as an adventurer and become a full-time employee!
Hey, aren’t your skills a bit too perfect? Do you have some wall-repairing cheat or something? Also, isn’t this drying too fast?
Who do you take Aqua, the goddess of water for? I can control the water inside this to make it dry quicker you know? Think back, when it’s my turn to wash the clothes, the clothes always dry really quickly right?
…This’ll work!
Yo Repair Chief, it’s your time to shine.
Leave it to me! Everyone, follow me! Today I’ll let you witness the chief’s artistry!
Chief, we’ll leave it to you!
Repair Chief!
Repair Chief, I’ll be in your care!
Repair Chief. Your task today is very important. The fate of the fortress is in your hands… then, please go ahead.
I understand, commander! There’ll be no problem, I’m the chief after all. Since I am such an impressive chief, there’s no way I would lose to that petty evil god!
Chief!
As expected of the chief! Let’s go, the walls are waiting for us to repair it! Let’s see your magnificent performance today!
…Uhm, where did that heavy mood a while back go?
Mhm… I wasted a night thinking about that…
Wolbach’s coming!
—-What is this!?
W-What do you mean by ‘what is this!?
I’m talking about the walls! It looked like it was on the verge of collapse a while ago, so how did it become like this!? Aren’t the walls thicker than last time!?
You’ll have to ask Aqua about that…
So it’s that woman’s fault—!
Ah hah~, and here I thought someone important came…Hm? Isn’t this, um… Who is this person?
Wolbach! …It seems like it’s time for us to settle our differences… Um, eh?
Hey, stop, stop! Can you not look at our Chomusuke like that!? Even though you have a crude face, could it be… that you are the type to like cute dolls and stuff? That means your interests are a lot like Darkness’…
Hey, Aqua! I don’t like those kinds of dolls…! Why would some like me…!
I’m not looking at it because it’s cute… but, well, it actually is quite cute…-?
Hey, you, what did you call that black cat?
Didn’t I just call it Chomusuke? Well, at first I thought the name was quite strange, but recently, I’ve began to think that it’s actually quite nice.
Hey, can you please not call its magnificent and powerful name strange?
What the heck is this!?
…Ah…uhm, if you don’t mind, I just want to say something. I think that that little one is a female… So I don’t think its name is very suitable…
Chomusuke is Chomusuke. It is my familiar and my pet.
Wh-What!? Hey, What did you say!? Why is my other half being treated so cruelly!?
Ah…
We can’t let her have it! Megumin, don’t let go of Chomusuke!
Wait a second! Hey, that little one is my other half you know!? This should be the time for an emotional reunion between long lost other halves!
I don’t know what you want with our Chomusuke, but can you promise to not oppose us? Can you promise to not attack the fortress again? If you can’t, then we can’t just give our enemy a power-up, you know?
Hey, don’t come any closer. I don’t really hate you, so I came to talk to you, but if you want me to let go of this little guy, then you’ll have to listen to what I say. Well, how about this, since you’re a god, why don’t you bet on your name that you won’t ever oppose us again?
Uwah…
Hey, is this guy an evil god as well? I mean, what kind of person can make an evil god cry?
Don’t say that Aqua. This guy is trying his best to associate with others in his own way. For his sake, you should say those things later.
Kazuma-san, that’s a bit bad…
…I’ll retreat for today, but don’t get so full of yourselves! Even if I can’t destroy the walls, the situation is merely a stalemate. As long as this fortress exists, my side has no way to advance to the capital. However, as long as we have control of the forest, you won’t be able to defeat us either.
What’s next is a battle of attrition! Until the walls and those murals are thoroughly annihilated, I will continue to attack!
U-, Uhm! Can I ask whether or not you still remember me!? My-, name is…Yunyun…
…I remember you. That time on the carriage, I invited you to join me on my journey… By the way, your name isn’t a nickname either, right…?
It’s my real name! Uhm… I remember that incident clearly as well! I even wrote it in my diary, and I would occasionally go back and read it.
I-Is that so…? To be honest you don’t have to take that incident to heart… but I guess it’s fine if you’re happy.
Uhm—!
Do you still remember me? My name is Megumin…
Alright, we’ll now confirm our battle strategy! First, the three of us will use the ‘Lurk’ ability to approach the enemy’s camp. Once we get into magic firing range, we’ll fire explosion magic at their camp, and then teleport to retreat! The enemies will probably counterattack afterward, so I would like to ask for everyone’s help when they do!
So it’s another sinister plan… Ah whatever, as long as the counterattack works, I won’t raise any complaints…
‘Explosion’—-!
W-…What, What is this———!?
W-What was that!? Explosion magic—!?
It’s the enemy, it’s an enemy ambush—!
Ah! Look over there, those people—! It’s two Crimson Demons and…
‘Teleport’—!’
—It’s a big success!
The enemy has begun to move—!
My adventurer brethren! We’ll leave the rest in your hands!
‘Explosion’—!
Ahhhhhhhh!
It’s those guys again! Don’t let them get away this time. Get them!!
You dare kill my comrades! Don’t think I’ll let you live! Surround them! Surround them!
‘Teleport’—!
‘Explosion’—!
The food! The food storage has been blown apart!
Damnit, they’ve come again! Can they at least not come at the break of dawn!?
Hurry up and call Wolbach-sama. Tell her to blow those imbeciles away!
Wolbach-sama just used explosion magic as well!
Just endure it! If we wait a little longer, their fortress walls will fall! When that happens, we can get rid of these pests in one fell swoop!
‘Teleport’—!
Wahahahahaha! My name is Megumin, the number one mage of Axel! Come, you shall all become my experience points today!
They’ve appeared—!
Run, hurry up and get outta here—!!
Idiot, don’t group up! That fanatic Crimson Demon will fire at places with lots of people! Go over there!
No, Not there! We need to split further apart if we don’t want to get hit by—!
‘Explosion’—!
Wahahahahaha! WAHAHAHAHAHA! I have come again today!
We understand! We understand! We surrender! We surrender already! Here, do you want some candy!?
I still have a mother to take care of back at home, so please—!
Don’t you think that the Crimson Demons and Demons have quite similar names? Hey, I’m sure we’ll make great friends!
Let’s talk this out, alright!? I’m sure we’ll come to a peaceful understanding! War is for idiots, after all!
‘Explosion’—!
Megumin, over there! Those people look like they’re running in different directions, but they’re actually gathering up!
I understand! Don’t think you guys’ll get away!
Wahhhhhhahhhhhh. God, please save me!! Wolbach-sama please—!!!
If I can choose my life and start over, I don’t want to be a demon! I want to be a cat… I want to be fed by a beautiful lady owner everyday… I want to be embraced by her…
This is just a dream. That’s right, when I wake up, my mother who had gone out for a walk will come back with a wild boar to make steak…
I-, I-, I-, I’m someone who is a candidate for a Demon King general! If you let me live, I’m sure Demon King-sama will pay a great ransom for me…!
‘Explosion’—!
I won’t let you get away! Why would I let you escape…Ah! Wait!
…Alright that’s enough. Let’s call it a day for now.
I can’t tell which side is the Demon King’s army anymore…
Ah, this is worrisome. I wouldn’t be able to level efficiently anymore…
I’m just gonna remind you, but we didn’t come here to farm experience points, alright?
Then Yunyun, let’s retreat for today. Even though it’s a shame I can’t fire explosion magic now, we can come again at night when those guys are starting to feel secure. Well then, please prepare the teleportation magic.
I’ve been looking for you guys for a long time. It seems we finally meet.
It seems that that person isn’t here today.
You guys went a bit overboard here… To be honest, I don’t want to fight anyone I’ve talked fondly to, so I’m a bit annoyed…
W-Wait a second! I don’t want to fight you either, after all, we took a bath together before!
Ah!?
…Please don’t mention such things in this kind of situation…
Eh!?
U-, Uhm, I feel like they have some sort of misunderstanding…
I don’t care if they misunderstand. Since we took a bath together twice, and you even said you don’t want to treat me as a stranger…
I did say that! I know it’s true that I said that! It’s also true that we did take a bath together, but—!
I’ve already investigated you, who have ambushed my subordinates day in and day out. Beldia, Vanir, Hans, Sylvia… Do you still remember these four names?
Wolbach onee-san, your ears are really red.
Shut up!
I do remember them… but I still don’t want to fight you.
Even if you don’t want to, I still can’t let you go. I also need to retrieve my other half. Also, if you’ve managed to defeat four Demon King generals… could you be the hero of that fairy tale?
Once I learned of your name, I realized I couldn’t let you go. Do you know? The name of the hero in that fairy tale?
…I don’t know the hero of whatever story you’re talking about. What’s his name?
Don’t play dumb. Is it because it happened too long ago, and you’ve already forgotten? The name of the hero in that fairy tale was Satou. Yes, the name is the same as yours, Satou. This name is already rare to begin with, so do you think that this is mere coincidence?
Uhm—
Do you really not remember me?
…Didn’t I tell you already? I don’t remember you… but don’t worry, I’ll remember you well from now on—as my sworn enemy who killed many of my subordinates.
!?
Oi!? Wait a second, I really don’t want to fight you…!
Yunyun, hurry up and chant your teleportation magic!
I-, I understand, I-I’ll do it as fast as I can!
‘Tinder.’
‘Teleport’—!
Hey, what happened Kazuma!? Isn’t the explosion sound rather small today?
Hey Kazuma. What’s up? Why is your face so pale? Did you get beat by that goddess?
We almost got blown away by explosion magic, and all I could do was throw the explosive in my bag and run away. Ah, this is the first time where I’ve felt that my luck is actually good.
…Hey, what is it? Why are you so excited? Is your other half nearby or something?
Hey Kazuma, by that explosive, you mean the thing you made before? If you threw it and the explosion noise could be heard from all the way over here, that means that the self-proclaimed goddess got blown to pieces, right?
—I’m sorry!
Even though I have been boasting since we left Axel, I wasn’t able to use magic at the crucial moment. Please forgive me…!
Did something happen between you and that onee-san in the past?
…I can’t tell you.
Hey, isn’t that Wolbach!?
That Wolbach of all people is injured to this extent…!
You were called Satou Kazuma, right? Not bad at all!
I heard from Aqua-sama. Unlike us, you don’t have any cheats, right?
Hey, she looks a bit weak right now. If we go now, we could probably beat her, right?
Alright, then let’s go! The elite of the Demon King’s army have also been decimated!
Even though she looks like a beautiful onee-san, this is not the time to be focused on that.
If we let our guard down for even a moment, we’ll get killed. Hey, anyone who is able to fight, get ready to go! Once we defeat Wolbach, we can press the advantage and clean up the rest of em’!
That person… is a Demon King general, and an evil god.
Even though she had invited me to travel with her, even though she made me happy to the point where I have reread that diary entry many times, even though I couldn’t sleep for a couples days after I regretted not accepting her invitation—
—We are Crimson Demons. We are members of the strongest magic race that was made to resist the Demon King. No matter what happens, no matter our circumstances, we shouldn’t get close with a Demon King general. It is our destiny after all.
I exchanged a few words with that onee-san before on a carriage. So if she’s going to be defeated by the other adventurers who don’t know anything about her, I would…I, I…I would rather…!
…What do you want to do?
…Eh?
I don’t really understand what happened—
But something happened between you and that person, right? Are you going to willingly watch her get eliminated?
Our opponent will use her full power if she can, and if she continues to pursue Chomusuke, then our lives will be endangered. So I wouldn’t stop the other adventurers from defeating Wolbach.
Isn’t stealing the spotlight the specialty of the Crimson Demons?
If you have an opponent you want to defeat personally, I don’t mind helping you.
You, so you really are the hero’s descendant aren’t you? You even used such a fearsome thing…
That was merely a product of civilization. However, I didn’t think that it would have such a strong effect on a Demon King’s general. Now that I’ve seen its effects, I should consider mass producing this…
Hey, why did you come here? The winner of this battle is clear, so isn’t it about time for you to retreat? If you promise to stop pursuing Chomusuke and not make us your enemy, I’ll let you go.
It’s regrettable, but if you are going to mass produce that fearsome thing, there’s no way I can let you live. Also, I cannot let that little one go. If I don’t retrieve my power from it, then I will disappear.
…So you are something like an undead?
My, how disrespectful of you. I am in my current state because I lost a lot of my power. If this continues, my existence will be devoured by my other half.
Um, could I ask something? If I give this guy to you, how would you retrieve your power? Are you two going to morph into one?
No, I will need to destroy it with my own hands. If I lower my guard, it will go on a rampage. When we were unsealed, it followed its nature and caused a lot of trouble for me, so I sealed away most of its power…
When you and Chomusuke were unsealed, did you see a little girl? A crimson-eyed girl around 5 to 6 years old…
I don’t remember.
…Hey, if we can talk peacefully like this, why did you join the Demon King army?
If you want to know, then defeat me.
You should know already, but this girl can use explosion magic as well. In other words, by the time the winner is decided, there’ll be no way for us to talk to each other.
…I suppose you’re right, then…
Ask the Demon King. He will definitely tell you the truth.
…You really remember me, don’t you?
When we talked to each other with Yunyun, you asked about her name like this: ‘…By the way, your name isn’t a nickname either, right?
There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you for a long time, something I wanted to you to see.
The explosion magic that you taught me has already reached the stage where I can control it without chanting aloud. My explosion magic is stronger than anyone else’s.
‘Explosion’———!!
Kazuma, are you still awake? Everyone is done with their bath.
Oh alright! I’ll go in a bit!
…So Chomusuke was here, I was looking for it you know?
This is my healing time, alright? So come and fetch this guy later.
I didn’t come here to fetch him. I just thought that it might’ve run away from the inn. Seeing Chomusuke with Kazuma is a pleasant thing.
…Hey, hey, are you looking for a fight?
Can I sleep with you tonight?
…Can you what? What did you say? I don’t know what you’re planning, but I’ll let you know that I’m not the same as I was during my hikiNEET days… Ah I remember now, I promised to myself the first time we stayed here, that if you or Darkness tried to provoke me with underhanded methods, I’ll ‘follow through’ no matter what happens.
I can, right? I mean, that’s why I came here tonight.
Hey, I’m a healthy young man, so don’t say those kinds of jokes. If you say those kinds of things, men will misunderstand. I heard that there are some unpopular men that fall in love with a girl the moment they shake their hand, so be careful, alright?
I told you before, didn’t I?
—I love you.
I-, If you keep this up you’ll definitely be a bad woman when you grow up. You can’t do these things so carelessly, alright? Listen closely, if you do something like this to a man, the man’s thing will go out of control and they won’t be able to resist the urge. In the future, please think a bit before you say such things. Lucky for you, I am a true man with a mind of steel, otherwise you would already be…
…When I grow up? What are you talking about?
I’m almost 15, you know? I’m already an adult.
Megumin! Where are you Megumin!? Are you here!?
Aqua, did you see Megumin on your side?
M-, Megumin, Aqua and Darkness are…A-Are you alright with this?
Um, I think Megumin wants to be alone for now. I want to as well… Something happened between her and Wolbach a long time ago, after all…
Is that so…Mm, well there wouldn’t be a problem as long as she doesn’t leave the inn… Then Aqua, let’s go to bed first.
Eh~ I wanted the four of us to play poker together…
M-Megumin. Uhm, you said you love me right? Well…Uhm…I think I also love you too!
…Really? What do you like about me?
…Um, well, like…explosion magic and such…?
If you really have nothing to say, do you think that throwing some explosion magic gibberish would make this better?
I love this uncomposed side of you, Kazuma. You have a lot of self-awareness, and when we meet some powerful enemies you won’t try to be manly or anything and protect us girls. Instead, you willingly use Darkness as a shield. Also, you don’t have the guts to do anything cruel, but you aren’t needlessly righteous about what you do either. You’ll do bad things when no one is looking, and you’ll do good things when you feel like it. You are a paradoxical, uncomposed normal person.
If you’re in debt then you’ll work hard, if you’re wealthy then you’ll stop working. If you’re in a good mood you’ll be gentle, if you’re in a bad mood then you’ll be vicious. You seem to think about your companions, but at the same time you’ll won’t hesitate to give your party members the short straw. Even though you seem really smart and flexible, sometimes you’ll do some unimaginably dumb things…
Finally, I love you, who always complains about every little thing, but chooses to help everyone in the end. Even though you aren’t straightforward with us, I understand that you are truly kind at heart. When it should be time for you to make a move, you decide not to – just like you are now. You can’t act cool, and you drop the ball at crucial moments, but that is the you that I love.
…Hey, hey, don’t force yourself! Do you really love me? Or is this a bit too early for you? Since I’m a gentleman, I have no problem with waiting, you know!? I am a man with much to spare, in terms of both money and love experiences—!
Ah! N-No, this is…!
…By the way, why did you come here tonight?
That was something that happened when I was about the same age as Komekko.
One day, at the Crimson Demon Village, I undid the seal on the evil god. That was when everything started.
I didn’t repay her in the end. Instead, I destroyed her by my own hands…
…Did I tell you before, that back at my homeland I did nothing but sit at home? That I was a NEET that did nothing with my life?
Mm, you’ve said that a lot of times already. That…
If you want to talk about being ungrateful, then there is no one who can beat me. My parents spent a fortune to send me to a private high school, but I never went to class, not even once. At first I was just trying to get a bit more free time to do what I wanted. On weekends I would stay up all night to play games, and during the weekdays I would be tired and annoyed. Since both my parents had to go to work, I thought this was a good chance to secretly cut class.
At first I just wanted to be lazy for a day. Then, I would skip class once a month. Then, I would skip class every monday. Before I knew it, I had decided to no longer go to school.
You said that you failed to repay her, but weren’t you the one to unseal Wolbach in the first place? Then, Wolbach’s other half came to attack you, and she had saved you and taught you explosion magic. You know, this is what they call a ‘match-pump.’ I know an delinquent adventurer that does that kind of thing.
In order to save the benefactor that unsealed her, she stopped the rampage of her other half. That’s what anyone would’ve done, so there’s no need to treat her as your benefactor… If you’re troubled by such a little thing, how would I ever be able to face my parents?
So what I mean is…How should I say this. In terms of the extent of ingratitude, no one can match up to me. In the time that you spent troubled by this, I had already become a piece of living trash. So, uhm…
…What is that supposed to mean!? I just tried to comfort you in my own way, and you repay me with this clown act? I even dug up my embarrassing history in order to do it! Now this is really what I would call ingratitude!
I’m sorry. It not that I’m looking down on you, I just thought it was sad that those parents had such a child. I also thought that using such a weird way to comfort me was pretty funny.
Well I’m sorry I did something I’m not good at! Listen up! You might think that you are the female lead of some tragedy, but the one who is suffering the most is actually me! You came to my room so that I could comfort you over some insignificant problem that didn’t even exist in the first place! Have you ever thought about my feelings!?
Then do you want to continue?
N-N-N-No way! Even though I would hurt myself to solve some insignificant problem, I won’t allow someone to lay a hand on me by taking advantage of my wounds!
Well then, that’s a shame isn’t it?
…Well then, if you can finally let go of your guilt towards that onee-san, and if you wanted to do that kind of thing again, I have no reason to refuse—!
Is that so? If that day really comes, then I’ll come to your room to play again.
Ahhhhhhh! I wasted such a good chance, and I even said such disgusting things! Agghhhh!!
No no no, calm down for a moment. Megumin has been a bit strange since yesterday. I’ll just observe her situation before I decide.
…What are you doing?
Meow~
…This is the bath that you hate very much, you know? Are you sure you want to go in?
…Y-, You want to come in?
Meow~
You’ll drown if you enter the bath, so just use this for now.
Wolbach-san, how is the water temperature?
…Nah, it couldn’t be.
…Hm? By the way, you haven’t grown at all in the last couple months, but I can’t help but feel that you look a little bigger now…
*Fuhaah~~*– Good morning!
Yunyun, let’s go back with ‘Teleport’.
I don’t really mind doing that, but why did you suddenly bring that up?
T-There’s nothing really, I just really miss Axel you know~~
Yeah, I want to hurry up and get back to Axel for my heartfelt reunion with Emperor Zell! Let’s go home quickly and have a celebration party! We beat that evil god, after all!
You’re right, we should be proud of our efforts this time. Until now, we fought against the Demon King’s generals because we were forced to, but this time around we fought one on our own accord, and managed to defeat her as well.
To be honest though, you didn’t really do anything.
Eh?
Hey, Yunyun, do you want to stay with us? There’s no need to force yourself to stay with us…
Eh!? Ah, y-, you mean me? Uhm, erm… if you would let me join you, I would happily…!
Ah, by the way, I’m not coming back tonight.
You’re not coming back? Then where are you planning to go!? I mean, when you go out with your friends, what exactly are you guys doing?
Hm!? T-T-T-T-That’s is well, shouldn’t you understand? It’s just things that friends do together, you know…
So you’re just doing things with friends? Then tell them to come celebrate with us. It’s a rare occasion for us to gather, so the more the merrier right?
Eh-!?
Well well, why don’t we have a drink with Kazuma tonight to celebrate his achievements?
Hey you, do you even know why I’m staying out tonight?
How would I know? By the way, where are you going?
The café, you know, that ‘café’? The one that operates 24/7?
…You, after what happened last night, you decided to do this kind of dirty business?
Hmm? What wrong Megumin? Your eyes are really red… What are you so excited about? Was it something that happened last night?
…That store has a lot of sexily dressed onee-sans. Hmm? Are they Kazuma’s type?
Huh, so you know about that store? And the type I like huh… I wonder what it is…?
…While we’re talking about this, could I ask what type of girl Kazuma likes?
My type? Hm, I haven’t really considered that before… If I really have to say it though, it would be a ‘long haired, big boob’ed girl that would dote on me a lot’?
Hey, what is it? I heard that if you sigh so much your luck stat would decrease.
Everyone, the preparations for ‘Teleport’ are done.
Alright, I’ll use the bounty reward to live outside for a week! Though I don’t really know how large the reward is.
‘Teleport’–!
…Kazuma, aren’t you feeding it a bit too much? You shouldn’t dote on it so much, you know?
But this guy hasn’t stopped eating—Here here, eat more and grow up quickly~
…There’s a letter for Kazuma. I don’t really know what’s it about though.
Is it that dragon egg salesman again? Ever since I bought Emperor Zell, he’s been sending these letters every day.
If it was sent to Kazuma, then it probably isn’t anything good. Let me take a look.
Here it is… I can’t help but feel like I’ve seen this envelope somewhere…
… Hey, what are you trying to do with a letter addressed to me?
… It is as Aqua said, it’s just a letter from the dragon salesman.
It’s just as I divined! Isn’t this great Kazuma? The mails sent to me all address me as ‘This letter is addressed to the one destined to a dragon, an adventurer of great fame and might.’
Hey, give me the let—.
I refuse.
It’s Iris, right!? Iris sent me that letter, right!?
How did you guess!? No, I mean, this is just a—!
AAhhhhhhhh!?
Look! As I thought, this is a letter sent to me by Iris!
Actually, I am going to meet with the prince of a neighboring country with whom I have an arranged marriage with, so I would like to hire onii-sama as my bodyguard—
Hyaaa!?
Hey, why didn’t you lock the door. Let me be clear, I am not in the wrong at all. After all, there is no need to knock before entering the bathroom in the day.
Y-Y-You turn your head away! And don’t try to play it off so easily, I already told everyone that the lock to the bathroom is broken! And even if this is an accident, men have to apologize for seeing the skin of a maiden!
Don’t think your warped logic will work on me! All you feminists are the same, always pushing for gender equality, but then asking the men to give way when things don’t go your way! If I accomplish enough merits to earn a peerage, I will abolish this trash system. Starting from this house.
I get it, I really do! There’s too many things for me to retort, so turn your head back first!
We already bathed together once, why are you still so shy? And you have already taken care of me a lot in that certain shop.
You are still going on about that!… And what is that shop?
That shop is just that shop. A shop that will be fine even if the young lady doesn’t know about it. By the way, are you done? I just woke up with a body of sweat, so I want to have a quick bath.
Y-You really have no reaction after seeing me naked. To think that you are still concerned with your sweat at a time like this.
I won’t be shaken by your naked body anymore. If you understand, then get dressed and leave.
… What, you want freeze magic too?
No! I am just mad that you don’t even care after seeing me in the nude! You saw the bare body of a woman, don’t you find your attitude right now terrible?
You are really troublesome… It’s partly my fault for not remembering about the lock being broken yesterday or the day before. But I really hope you can tell me if you want me to be interested or not interested in your naked body.
… Well, the ideal situation would be for you to be very interested, but I don’t want you to see.
If it was Aqua, she will forget after I buy a bottle of expensive wine for her. Megumin would probably not mind at all.
That’s because they are abnormal! If you feel any guilt at all, I don’t mind forgiving you if you apologize. I don’t need you to buy wine for me like Aqua, just do something to appease me.
Do something to appease you. Abuse you verbally or kick you in public? I am a normal guy without such fetishes, so I can’t do such plays with you…
Idiot, I don’t need such nonsensical things at a time like this! There are many things you can do. Like giving me something I like, or accompany me to a restaurant with great atmosphere.
If it’s something you like, there isn’t any pet shop, so no collars. As for restaurants… I only frequent the barbecue shop though.
… At a time like this, I hope you can put my fetish aside and give me something normal. As for restaurants, those frequented by commoners feel rather fresh, but it would be better if it caters for advanced booking or memberships.
Go and prepare gifts for me as apology! If you see the skin of a maiden, you will have to pay the appropriate price…!
I get it, I will let you see my naked body and call it a draw. Then it’s all good.
How is that good!? Who want to see that… Hey, don’t take your pants off, stop! I-I get it, forget about this! S-Stop… Hyaaahh!
Hey Kazuma, listen to this, Emperor Zell finally learned a trick.
I admit that you are a first rate performer, but it’s impossible for a chick to learn a trick. We are betting the dishwashing chore for next week, don’t disturb us.
Heehee, I always lose to you, but I have a big advantage today! And you’ve already used the once a day explosion rule in your match against Megumin! I will win, there’s no way I can lose!
Aqua, Kazuma and Darkness seem busy, how about letting me be your audience.
Are they really? Well then Megumin, I’ll allow you to be the one to witness Emperor Zell’s magnificent performance.
How about it Kazuma, it’s about time you surrender, right? After I told my father about my consecutive losses, my father, who is known as the treasured sword of the Kingdom, taught me this sure win tactic.
For a grand noble, your dad is too childish. He dotes on his daughter too much.
W-What is this!? I was thinking that a mere chick won’t be able to do much…!
Hmmp, you get it, right? After all, it is not a chick, but a dragon. This is just a simple matter.
Hey Aqua, what did that thing do? Show me.
You just said you didn’t want to see, so why are asking me? Emperor Zell’s performance had ended for the day. The next show would be next month.
Ah, hey that’s too much, just show it to me for a while, I really want to see it.
Hey Kazuma, just concede if you want to see Emperor Zell’s performance. I saw it too, it was amazing. It probably surpasses Aqua’s usual performance.
… It’s that amazing?
Aqua, please do it again! I have never seen something so amazing.
No Megumin, that’s a performance from Emperor Zell’s soul that it did in order to repay my careful daily tutelage. It’s not something that could be performed so simply.
I couldn’t help being impressed after seeing that performance. Kazuma, are you willing to be the only one not to have seen it?
You’ll regret it if you don’t see it. Emperor Zell’s lifespan might shorten if it performs that too many times. It is sleeping now because it exhausted all of its energy from doing that, right?
Right? If Emperor Zell doesn’t want to, then I can’t do anything about it… Ahh!? Emperor Zell woke up! Are you fine!? You are doing it!? You want to perform again!?
Ah! Emperor Zell just…! Kazuma, Darkness! Emperor Zell is all prepared!
Hey, hey Aqua! Don’t mess around and come here, I want to see. Darkness, let’s take a time out.
No. It’s your loss if you leave the seat. How can you leave before the match is decided? Come, choose! You want the party trick or to battle!
Alright, get ready Megumin! Watch carefully and witness Emperor Zell’s special performance!
If I can see it again, the lofty me might fall for Emperor Zell!
I get it, I concede! Hey Aqua, wait, I want to see too!
Then watch Emperor Zell’s special performance carefully.
Look closely at Emperor Zell’s special trick!
This child will sleep when I do this. Early to bed and early to rise makes a chick healthy, wealthy, and wise, right?
Here, Aqua, Megumin. This is the agreed payment. But father is really despicable… To use circumstances outside the chess board to force the opponent to concede…
Hey, wait a minute!!!
Hey, I’ve told you a bunch of times, but that’s just some cheap 400 Eris thing. Once we get back to the capital, I’ll make sure to buy a better one alright?
It’s fine! I don’t want any other ring, I’m fine with this one!
Geez, you’ve kept this attitude for a while now. What’s it supposed to mean? Are you trying to show off to me? If you want it taken away so badly, how about I rob it from you!?
W-What do you want!? Are you looking for a fight!?
Don’t be so angry Megumin. Didn’t I already buy you an Elroad rice cracker? It was more expensive than that ring you know?
It isn’t a problem of price! That was tasty and all, but I can’t help but feel that I’ve lost in some way!
It’s because I am Onii-sama’s little sister. Little Sisters are special, unlike plain friends!
W-, What do you mean? Why have I been downgraded to ‘Kazuma’s friend’!? I am Kazuma’s close companion and someone who lives in the same house as him! Beyond friends, we’re basically family!
Then as his sister, we are family! That means that I am an existence that is beyond Megumin-san right!?
Alright, since you’ve been asking for a fight this entire time, why don’t I take you on!?
Royalty is strong! I absolutely, absolutely won’t lose to you!!
I want to go catch a wild dullahan.
Wait, I don’t get what you’re talking about.
What happened to you Kazuma? Did you finally open your eyes to the Axis cult, and now you want to go hunt the undead? I’m really happy about that, but there’s no way you’re gonna find a wild dullahan. For now, just be patient and hunt skeletons or ghosts instead.
The reason I want to look for a wild dullahan is to learn the ‘Premonition of Death’ skill. In order to succeed with a certain plan of mine, that skill is absolutely necessary. Do you think there are any places where I could find one?
Hah—!? The lich’s ‘Drain Touch’ is fine, but why do you always want to learn all these dirty skills!? Hand over your adventurer card! As long you have points remaining, I’ll make you learn as many of my party performance skills as you can!
Oi stop it, you idiot! Don’t decide things on your own! More importantly, hurry up and hand over your healing magic!
Why exactly do you want to learn such a dangerous skill? Also, in terms of rank, dullahans are only behind vampires and liches you know? As if you could meet something like that out in the open.
No, it’s not like that. Thanks, Megumin, there is indeed a use for your explosion magic. Well, in the end, I guess I can’t ask for too much huh… Alright Megumin, let’s go to the neighboring nation! Then, once we get there, we’ll fire one shot at the capital of that nation, and send a threatening letter. ‘If you don’t want to be struck by explosion magic again, then abandon your engagement with Princess Iris. As a representative of the demon king army, I do not recognize your engagement with her—’
Are you an idiot!? I thought you started acting weird ever since you received that letter from Iris-sama; so you were actually thinking of doing something so pointless! Could it be, that you wanted to learn the dullahan’s ‘Premonition of Death’ because you wanted to curse Iris-sama’s fiancé!? Also, where did the demon king army come from!?
What do you mean by pointless! Yeah, I want to use the skill to curse Iris’ fiancé from a distance. Then I’ll say, ‘Haha-n, this is the handiwork of the demon king army isn’t it? Stealing away a princess is the demon king’s job. Since you stole away the important work of the demon king, you earned his hatred. Well, here we have an archpriest that can dispel the curse, but there’s no saying when you might get cursed again. Until the demon king is defeated, I strongly recommend you cancel your engagement…’
The worst… You’re the worst kind of man possible! To use precious skill points to do something so stupid, do you have no shame!?
You’re saying this to me now, after I’ve already learned the ‘escape’ and ‘cooking’ skills? Recently, in order to determine whether or not the adventurers at the guild were spreading bad rumors about me, I even learned the ‘lip reading’ skill.
Y-You’re really going in a direction that’s unrelated to adventuring aren’t you? Anyway, I won’t allow you to bring Megumin along to enact such a stupid plan.
Can I join in on your plan? Specifically, I want to know more about the part where you frame everything on the demon king army. After all, one of the daily activities of the Axis cult is to spread bad opinions about them.
Just to make sure, the reason the demon king attacks humanity isn’t because of the Axis cult right?
Well, I guess it can’t be helped. Let us use a frontal attack. After accepting the bodyguard request, we’ll do whatever we can to prevent the worst from happening. Since I have a lot of skill points to spare, I’ll use them to learn some useful skill when the time comes for it…
—Oi. What exactly is this supposed to mean? Explain.
So you’re awake, Kazuma. Sorry about this, but for the next three days I’m going to keep you restrained. What? Don’t worry about it. You’ll be served the best food during this time, and I will take care of you personally. If there’s anything you want then I’ll tell my butlers to go buy it.
What’s up with you all of a sudden? Why did you tie me up? Taking your fetish into consideration, aren’t our positions reversed? Could it be that you love me so much that you can no longer resist your urges?
As if I would like a fickle man like you! And don’t talk about my fetish, tying you up is completely unrelated to my personal interests.
You’re just as bothersome as usual. Isn’t it too late to say anything when you’ve already kissed me on the cheek? Being a dead-dere isn’t popular nowadays you know?
Who’s a dead-dere! Also, this is unrelated to that incident a while ago. You and I had that kind of dizzy atmosphere here and there back then, but… Well nevermind that, that’s not what we need to talk about. What we need to discuss is about Iris-sama.
Sorry about this Kazuma. About Iris-sama’s bodyguard request that we received the other day, I’m going to send a letter to reject it. Iris-sama will be leaving for the neighboring nation in three days, so until I’ve confirmed that she’s left, I’m going to keep you tied up. So you need to act mature and persevere for now.
Are you kidding me!? That’s the reason you tied me up! At this rate, my little sister will be married to that suspicious man you know!?
As if you have the right to say that as a commoner whose origins are completely unknown! If you want to convince me that you’re not a suspicious man, then tell me about your past! …Yes, I’ve actually meant to ask you for a long time. In what nation were you born? Where did you learn all those strange things? Why are you lacking common sense… things like that…!
Megumin—! Aqua—! Help me! I’m being imprisoned by a female pervert—!
H-, Hey, stop saying weird things! Also, too bad, those two are currently away. What’s left is to call for my retainers, and have you moved along with the bed to my home. If I let you become a bodyguard, then this nation will definitely run into some trouble with foreign relations. This is for the sake of my nation, so just be patient.
Just what kind of foreign relation problems will arise if I become a bodyguard! I learned the proper noble etiquette during the time I lived at the castle, so I won’t do anything disrespectful! So let me go!
Don’t you dare say anything! You’re the living definition of ‘disrespect’! If you act obediently, I’ll let you eat delicacies that you normally won’t be able to get your hands on. And aren’t you a NEET at heart anyway? All you have to do is lie down while I take care of you. Not a bad deal right?
… I guess you’re right. Alright, I get it.
Y-You get it…!? Well, a lot of trouble has happened recently. Occasionally, spending time with you like this is…
Well then, I’ve had an intense urge to go to the toilet for a while now, so could you do something about this quickly?
…Eh?
Don’t eh me, you said it yourself didn’t you? That you would personally take care of me. Naturally, that means taking care of ‘down under’ too right?
………Eh—
Anyway, hurry up and follow my order. Oi Darkness, go and fetch the urine bottle.
Eeeeehhhh-!?
Don’t eeeehhh me, hurry up. Geez, this ojou-sama is really useless. Weren’t you the one who said that in the first place? Now come on, hurry up and move it already.
N-N-, No—! That’s not what I meant! It’s true that I said that I would take care of you, but that’s not what I meant, so please wait!
I can’t wait anymore. ‘Going to bathroom when I wake up’ is a natural phenomenon. That said, this is something that you have to do everyday alright? After all, I’m not gonna force this job on your servants who I’ve never seen or met. Now, hurry it up already.
Uuuum… b-but…
Ah, this is gonna get ugly, I can’t hold on any longer. How long are you gonna stay embarrassed? I helped you go to the bathroom recently as well remember? I even helped you remove your underwear and get toilet paper. We’ve already known each other for such a long time, so don’t be ashamed now. Even if it’s just the lower half, hurry up and release the binds.
…It can’t be released.
…Huh?
I didn’t think about the problems down there. W-, What should we do, the rope I used to restrain you is a fairly powerful magic tool. It can’t be released halfway. Basically, for the next three days, you will stay…
You idiot! What am I gonna do!? Are you saying that for the next three days I’m gonna have to piss in my pants!? Oi stop kidding around! If that really happened to me, then I’ll make sure the same happens to you sometime alright!?
H-, Happens to me…
It’s an emergency situation so stop anticipating it! Ah, Damnit!
I-, I got it, leave it to me!
Alright, good work. Now there’s a urine bottle over there so bring it over.
… Why do you have something like this? Why exactly would you…
This is something like a NEET’s best friend. After all, there are times during the winter when it’s so cold that you don’t want to get out of bed, or it’s too bothersome to go to the toilet in the morning, right? At those important junctures, it’s a treasure.
Just how far are you… Well nevermind, it saved us this time. I’ll put it here.
Oi, I can’t go like this right? There’s no way I can’t go if you don’t pull down my underwear.
Ehh-!?
Don’t ehh me. My hands are tied up and I can’t move my body you know? In the first place, weren’t you the one who caused this situation? It’s gonna spill at this rate, so hurry up!
E-E-E-Even if you say that-! Ah geez…
…Hm? Oi Kazuma, your pants are being pulled by something and won’t come down. This is…
Sorry, it’s a physiological phenomenon that happens when waking up.
Wa-, WAAAAHHHHH!
OWOWOWOOWWOWOWOW STOP! STOP! IT’S GONNA BREAK!
What the heck are you thinking!? I almost got a class-change in gender you know!? You better remember this, after I get untied I’m definitely gonna make you cry!
I’ve already cried but… Hey Kazuma, shouldn’t we just give up? I mean, once Aqua comes back, we can just use her ‘Create Water’ and ‘Purification’ skills to clean it up…
You want me to leak!? You want me to give up everything and leak!? Is that what you’re saying!? Stop saying stupid things and move it! This won’t work if you turn your eyes away! Since this is all your fault, take responsibility and look! Come on, hurry up!
Ku-, why did this happen…! All I wanted to do was to keep you away and protect Iris-sama… b-but, for me – a lady of a noble family – to be forced to do something so precarious, and to be ordered to look down there… This situation isn’t too bad, now that I think about it…
Oi, stop saying stupid things to yourself and move it! There’s no time! No, I’m done for, I can’t hold on any longer!
W-, Wait Kazuma, I’ll help you right now alright!? Since it’s come to this, we might as well get this over with quickly! Ah geez, if Megumin or Aqua see this…
Awawawawawawa… To think that Darkness and Kazuma developed such a relationship… Well, I’m gonna go to the guild and announce it to everyone ok!?
“WAIT!
—Fu, you saved me Aqua. I was almost forced to leak by this perverted girl over here.
Uu… I-, I’m not a perverted girl…
Well I don’t really care about the details since this isn’t the first time that Darkness has been a pervert, but just what kind of play were you guys doing?
A-, Aqua!?
Recently, we got a bodyguard request letter from Iris right? And like, for some reason, Darkness is really against me accepting the request, so she decided to tie and lock me up in her own house. After amusing herself with me for a while, she planned to reject the request.
Darkness, if you’re gonna do that, then of course you deserve to be called a perverted girl, you know?
Just who is gonna amuse themselves with you! …But this time around, it’s actually really bad. The person Iris-sama is engaged to is the first prince of the neighboring nation, Elroad. Furthermore, it seems like this prince is also extremely troublesome to deal with. If you act like you usually do, and do something disrespectful, there’ll surely be some foreign affairs problems.
Elroad? Did you just say Elroad? Are we going to the nation of casinos, Elroad?
Aqua, just making sure that you know, but if we’re going, we’ll be performing this bodyguard request, and not to play around alright? That’s right, if you want to go to the casinos in Elroad that badly, then let’s all go there another time for a vacation! Since everyone has a lot of money, we don’t really need to work while we’re there, we can just go there to genuinely play around!
Alright, it seems that Aqua also wants to accept this request! Well then, after Megumin comes back, why don’t we take a majority vote? Well, even if I say that, since we haven’t done any quests or travelled anywhere recently, I don’t think she’s gonna be against it!
Uuuuu…
No.
What do you mean by ‘no’? Even though, you’re always the first one to agree, saying that ‘I want to defeat a powerful enemy I’ve never seen before’, why not this time?
There’s no particular reason. Geez, this man. Normally, you’re unwilling to work even if we force you. So why is it you choose to accept the request immediately once Iris gets involved?
Oh, what’s with you? Jealous?
Yes, I’m jealous. Since all that has happened, shouldn’t you pay a little more attention to me?
Eh… Ah, right.
Kazuma, does Iris really weigh on your mind that much?
N-, No well, I just can’t help but feel worried about that girl. Rather than someone of the opposite gender, I worry about her because she – due of her position – tends to worry too much about how people think. As a result, she’s not allowed to do anything selfish, and I can’t help but get the feeling that she’s always lonely. So that’s why I care so much about my little sister.
Well but, if you really don’t want to then I’ll think of some other way. If we’re gonna go be bodyguards, then I want everyone to go. It’s a shame that I won’t be able to see Iris, but…
Let’s accept.
I’m also bothered by that girl. Just now, I was feeling a bit jealous. That’s all.
O-, Oh.
Oh you’re home Megumin. We’re having a feast tonight! …What happened Kazuma, your face is flushed you know?
N-N-, Nothing happened! Right Megumin!?
You know, Megumin, if you came home earlier, you would have seen an interesting sight. When I got back, Darkness had Kazuma tied up in a bed, and was about to amuse herself using him.
Oho?
Wait, Aqua, I didn’t plan to amuse myself using him! It’s true that I tied him up, but like I explained before…
No, if Aqua had come home any later, then Darkness was gonna pull down my pants. She really saved me you know?
Wha—!?
…Well, Darkness is in heat all year round, and while what she does to whoever has no relation to me whatsoever, she’s still the lady of a great family. That’s why I can’t approve of her forcing herself onto men, really—!
N-N-N-N-No…! It’s not like that Megumin, there are circumstances! Also, don’t say that I’m in heat all year round!
Hm, are you curious about this Kazuma? As expected of someone who goes with me to food festivals, your eye for food is quite good. Yes, our dinner for tonight is blowfish! Not only that, this in particular is known as the king of blowfish, ‘paradise blowfish’. Although its poison is a stage stronger, it’s a delicacy that’s rated by gourmets as ‘I don’t care if I die after eating this’! Also, the blowfish is currently in season as well.
I’m not sure whether the blowfish’s name is talking about what happens while you’re eating it, or after that. Well, to think that you had a license for blowfish preparation… I thought that you were a person with a lot of talents, but this is really something else huh?
No way I would have a license. Tell me if your body feels a bit numb ok? I’ll cast detoxification magic.
Oi.
Tasty tasty.
Don’t eat it, the poison hasn’t been filtered out you know!?
What is it Kazuma? You’re afraid of poison despite being an adventurer? With Aqua, whose first-rate only when it comes to priest skills, there’s nothing to be afraid of.
Hey Darkness, did you just say ‘only when it comes to priest skills’?
Not at all.
That’s right. Other things aside, your healing magic is really first-class. Alright!
Hey Kazuma, did you just say ‘other things aside’?
Not at all. …This is tasty! What is this, this is super tasty!
It’s nice that you’re all happy. Originally, these blowfish were meant to be used by Cecily for attracting new believers. Her amazing strategy involved attracting passersby with the charm of this blowfish. Then, once they eat it, with the condition of detoxification magic, she will force them to convert to the Axis cult. Well, she was taken away by the police for some reason.
So you were planning to do something like that? Didn’t I tell you to cut your relations with that girl?
By the way, don’t the organs of the blowfish have particularly strong poison? Don’t get caught up and eat too much okay? Your presence is meaningless if you – the magic user – are paralyzed and can’t move when it matters alright?
Idiot, what I’m wearing are divine treasures you know? It’s an amazing article that can nullify any harmful conditions. There’s no way the poison of a blowfish could have any effect you know?
Fufufu, fhat’s up Kafuma. At may fevel, may resistasnce to roison is quite…
Your tongue is so numb I can’t even tell what you’re saying.
Hm- Oi Aqua! This firl ish… Eh, I fan’t speak clearly…
Suhaha—
You liffle, don’t fet drunk so fuickly! Get up! I shed get up—!
Hey Kazuma, do you really want to take Iris-sama’s request? Let me explain. Even if we disregard your disrespectful attitude, I think that with our actual abilities, we’ll probably fail the bodyguard request. What other party besides ours would be almost wiped out by blowfish?
What happened yesterday was not a failure as adventurers, so it doesn’t count. We’re the ones that have defeated the most demon king army generals in this world, and the number one party of Axel. No one can complain about us.
Aqua went to drop Emperor Zell and Chomusuke off somewhere, but she’s late isn’t she? Did something happen?
I’ve dropped them off. When that depraved masked guy saw Chomusuke, he said ‘Ohoho, Moi looked away for a mere moment, but another interesting development has occurred ho!? FUHAHAHAHAHA!’ and started rolling around or something. Well, there shouldn’t be any problems either way.
Oi, you guys, let me be the one to talk with the teleport store’s owner. I’ve wanted to complain about this place since forever.
Complain? You, did you have some sort of fight with the store owner?
Yo old geezer, I’m here again! Could you please teleport me to the capital?
Welco-… Aren’t you the wanted man, Satou Kazuma!? Didn’t I already tell you that you’re not allowed to teleport to the capital!? Is your memory that bad!?
Y-, You, I look away for a moment and you tried to go meet Iris-sama?
Yeah. I don’t know whether or not it’s the handiwork of that noble named Claire, but I’m apparently not allowed to teleport to the capital. But not this time. Here old guy, look at this! This is a written invitation from royalty. This is official, so don’t get it dirty alright!?
Is this real? You didn’t forge this somewhere right? A while ago, you even threatened me by saying ‘If you mess with me, who’s related to the Dustiness family, something bad’s gonna happen’, remember?
Oi Kazuma, come here for a moment. I want to have a word with you.
I refuse. Oi old geezer, this girl here is the lady of the Dustiness house. Look, if you live in this city, you should have some impression of her right? Then you know I wasn’t lying right?
Don’t just tell me ‘I refuse’! Hey Kazuma, you didn’t use my name to do any weird things right? You didn’t abuse the authority of my family to do anything, right?
I didn’t do anything more than mention your name when Aqua was kicked out of a high-class restaurant because of her clothing ok?
I didn’t do anything more than say that ‘I would have a word with Darkness’ if the carpenters refused to perform maintenance and reconstruction on the Axis cult’s church.
I didn’t do anything more than say that ‘this is something that Lalatina-ojou-sama will eat, so please give me the tasty parts please’ when I was buying the ingredients for dinner.
Judging from that reaction, I can see that you are a member of the Dustiness house. Uhm, about your request to teleport to the capital, I won’t charge you, so…
Oh, excuse me then—
I’ll pay! I’ll pay the full price! I can’t allow myself to cause anymore trouble for the citizens of this town!
Oi Kazuma, I have a lot of things to ask you after we finish this request. Mark my words. The same goes for the two of you over there! Don’t try to pretend that you’re not involved!
Geez, what a stubborn ojou-sama. As your party members, aren’t we basically family? We give and we take, and we help each other in times of need. Regardless of whether you’re a noble or not, our attitudes won’t change. That’s what it means to be companions you see. When the time comes, feel free to use my name as the number one adventurer of Axel as well.
That right Darkness. Tell me anytime you want to borrow the authority of the Axis church. I’ll help you out.
Darkness, although I was a bit surprised when I found out that you were a noble, to me, Darkness is just the Darkness I know. If you’d like to borrow of the power of the Crimson Magic clan, feel free to talk to me. I can write a letter to everyone in the village.
Y-, You guys…! …Hm? No wait, this is strange! No matter how I think about it, there won’t be a time where I need to borrow anyone’s name or the power of the Axis church or the Crimson Magic clan…
Hey Kazuma, did you know this? Apparently, when teleporting, there’s a small chance for a rare accident to happen that causes you fuse with other small animals that get inside the magic circle! According to some rumors, this is how werewolves and lamias are made you see! You see!
Then next time, why don’t we capture three or so goblins and teleport them with you? If the fusion goes correctly, I think your intelligence might increase.
What are you saying you stupid NEET. You’re the one that needs to teleport with ants and raise your body to NEET ratio.
Ah, uhm… An accident will really happen, so please stand still in the circle…
Alright old geezer, send us to the capital!
Wha, wait…!
‘Teleport’!
Halt! Those who do not have business here may not enter! This is not a place for adventurers!
I am the Satou Kazuma, an adventurer from the town of Axel. We have taken a request from princess Iris. Is there a problem?
E-, Excuse my manners…! I will immediately go and call my superiors, so please wait a moment! May I be entrusted with the envelope?
Mm, I suppose that’s fine.
Huh, the letter inside is rather damaged. This is…?
My, please don’t mind it! You know, a lot of things happen when you’re an adventurer right? You get it? Monsters and stuff you see!
Ahh, I see… Well then, please wait a moment at the waiting room over here.
—With regards to Satou Kazuma-dono, your name has recently become famous in the capital you see? I heard that, you lent your aid to the fortress at the very front line, which had come under the leadership of Dustiness-sama, and led our forces to victory in a seemingly trifling series of battles. It is often said that; Carrying tact, cleverness, and a countless number of skills, is the leader, Kazuma-dono. Together, with the crusader, Dustiness-kyo, a lovely arch-wizard whom carries an amazing amount of magic power, and finally a plasterer, your group is an amazingly skilled party.
Hey, I just wanna say that you left out the existence of the lovely archpriest.
Although only the names of Kazuma-dono and Dustiness-kyo could be determined, could it be that the person over there is the rumored great magician that uses explosion magic? Despite having played an amazingly active role in the incident, for some reason, her name is still unknown. As a result, it is rumored that she is a humble and mysterious person that refuses to stand in the spotlight…
…Hm, is there a rumor like that? Well, I suppose it is true to say that I am humble, after all, I give all the money we earn from our adventures to Kazuma.
Hey, I just want to say that my name isn’t there either. My name isn’t there despite how worldly famous I am.
A-, Amazing, are you saying that you have no interest in wealth or fame!?
Fu… My only desire is to reach to limits of the true essence of magic. When the leader, Kazuma, requires my power, I tell him this: ‘What I desire is the minimum food and other small expenses, and also, a place where my power can be brought to proper use’…!
OOOOHHHH!
Ahh! He actually came!
It’s quite cruel of you to say ‘he actually came’ isn’t it? I came all the way here because I was called by Iris you know? Generally speaking, wouldn’t it be better to have a nice night banquet to congratulate the party that defeated yet another demon king army general?
Um… T-, That is…
What are you doing Kazuma? Why are you staring at their faces?
Ah, I was just confirming the condition of the skill I learned recently.
Satou Kazuma! Is it true that Satou Kazuma has come!?
—Oh, what’s up white suit. Are you also against me being a bodyguard?
Don’t call me ‘white suit’ you imbecile. However, you came at the right time. I give you my thanks.
You’re thanking me? Just what has come over you? What are you planning?
I’m not planning anything. …No, rather, it would be wrong to say that I haven’t planned anything. Oi, you, take this.
…For real, what’s up with you? Despite your usual attitude, could it be that you actually long for me? Well, it’s regrettable for you, but recently I’ve had a good feeling with a certain girl. As a forthcoming and honest man, I cannot allow myself to step any further. Sorry about this, but please give up.
You’re truly idiotic, why would I do that! Rather, I haven’t even said anything yet, so why are you already turning me down!
It’s not like that. Just this time, I feel like you and I can work together. This meeting will have a lot of political implications, but… In the first place, before all of this happened, I was already against Iris-sama’s marriage.
Alright, fill me in on the details.
The person Iris-sama will be meeting is the first prince of the neighboring country. However, due to his spoiled upbringing and education, he is a truly selfish brat. He is no equal for Iris-sama, who was born with the talent for battle, and surely, his appearance is also incomparable to her adorableness and beauty. Furthermore, the neighboring country of Elroad looks down upon my nation. Should Iris-sama be wedded to him, those imbeciles will surely speak maliciously of her and look at her with contemptuous eyes… That’s why I’ll entrust this to you.
This is?
It is a forbidden poison that is used by nobles to bury their political enemies…
Hey, how much money do you think I spent to get my hands on that!
I suppose it can’t be helped. Then, I have another thing to request of you besides the bodyguard mission. As long as you have the necklace that I entrusted you with a moment ago, you should be able to freely use the authority of my household, Shinfornea, to a certain extent. For this time, and this time only, you will have the backing of my household. How could I possibly hand Iris-sama to such a suspicious person? Do whatever you have to do to dissolve this engagement.
If that’s the case, I’ll gladly accept. How could I stand and watch as misfortune befalls Iris? Please leave this to me. If the person in question is a cheeky, shitty brat, I’ll do whatever I can to get in the way.
I appear to have misunderstood your circumstances. Please forgive my disrespect towards you until now. I will leave Iris-sama in your hands.
It’s nothing, rather, I have a lot of things I’m sorry about as well. It seems like your beliefs towards Iris are the real deal. Despite how I look, I’m a man that has encountered countless amount of powerful enemies. Something of this level is easy-peasy.
In this situation, I believe that you are the person I can rely on the most. While I cannot leave this nation, I promise you that the rewards will be grand. So I will leave the rest to you.
I am grateful to have someone as powerful as you supporting me. As for the rewards; I suppose that when all this is smoothly done, we should come together to discuss how cute Iris was when she was kid over a glass of wine.
What an ambitionless man you are. When the time comes, let us talk all the way until the next morning. I will tell you all about how destructive Iris-sama was during her childhood years.
The two of you seem to be enjoying yourselves quite nicely.
It’s been a long time onii-sama. I’ve been waiting for you…!
Lizard Runners! Kazuma, these are Lizard Runners you know!? Lizard Runners!
Kyuukyuukyuu!-!
Hm, will we be using the imperial carriage? I heard that this meeting was supposed to be a secret though…
Using a normal carriage would take too much time. Using a normal, horse drawn carriage would take ten days of travel to arrive at the capital. However, using this carriage that was specifically designed for royalty, the travel time can be greatly shortened.
I don’t know what I might do if I couldn’t see Iris-sama for over ten days. A normal carriage would take over twenty days here and back. How could I possibly endure that?
If that’s the case why don’t you just come with us?
Didn’t I already tell you that this journey was a secret? If there are too many followers, then people will assume that the entourage involves a noble from somewhere. For this reason, the carriage has also been redesigned for a simple appearance. More importantly, as an authoritative figure of this nation, I have duties I need to fulfill. In the end, the affairs of the nation cannot be set aside for any more than a few days you see?
Please sit here onii-sama! Since the seat beside me will be open, we can play games like before while we travel!
Oh? You’re quite an onii-chan’s girl aren’t you Iris. Alrighty, onii-chan will do his best ok!
Oi! How gutsy of you to take the best seat despite being a mere underling! Now, hand over the seat behind the driver that has the best view to me, or I won’t invite you to go play again!
H-, How unfair of you! This and that are different problems! Besides, today, I’m not your underling, but a princess! An authority! I will not hand over the seat behind the driver. If you wouldn’t have it any other way, then I’m up for a fight as well!
…Hey Darkness, did you go meet Iris in secret? I can’t help but get the feeling that Iris and Megumin seem to get along better than before.
N-, No, nothing like that has happened… More importantly, I’m a bit curious about why Megumin called Iris-sama an ‘underling’.
Then both Iris and I will sit behind the rider’s seat.
Alright, I wouldn’t lose to you. The loser of this game will have to listen to the order of the winner!
Hey, weren’t you guys competing for the right to sit beside me? How did it turn out like this?
Then I’ll sit beside Darkness ok? I want to sit in the front to see the scenery while we’re travelling after all.
Iris-sama, did you forget anything? Did you bring your handkerchief? What about extra change to use in times of need? In emergency situations, don’t hesitate to use the scrolls and magic items I gave you alright? If you’re feeling lonely, please don’t cry…
Claire, I’m not a child anymore, so I’ll be fine. Besides, if you don’t let go, we won’t be able to leave, so…
Alright then Iris-sama, please don’t push yourself, and stay safe. Have a nice trip!
Satou Kazuma, I’ll leave Iris-sama in your care! If anyone dares to show disrespect to Iris-sama, you may go as far as to slash them!  …Iris-samaaaaaaa!
Well then, I’ll be going!
WAAAAAAH Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san!! I want you to switch seats with me! This is too scary!
Oi, isn’t this too fast! If an accident happens at this speed, we’ll die instantly!
It’s alright Kazuma! The carriage used by royalty all have a powerful barrier cast upon them. In the case of an accident, the people sitting at the driver’s seat will be the only ones to go ‘splat’. HAHAHAHA, wonderful! These lizard runners are truly wonderful! Good, let’s go even faster!
Stop! Hey, let me get back in the carriage!
Kazuma Kazuma, there were mandrake-like creatures copulating just now!
W-, Where is it!? I want to see the mandrake as well!
What you want to see aren’t the mandrakes but the copulation right? Not only do we have a noble lady who tried to amuse themselves with Kazuma, but we also have a member of royalty who’s a closet pervert. Will this country really be fine?
There aren’t any closet perverts in royalty! …Who is the noble lady who tried to amuse themselves with onii-sama? …Could it be—
Hey, what are we going to do if we crash into a monster at this speed!? If a precious existence like myself goes ‘splat’ in a place like this, this world is going to end! Hey Darkness, are you listening!?
It’s alright Aqua. This carriage is outfitted with magic tools that repel monsters, so it’s unlikely for monster to suddenly come out and crash into us. Yes, as long as our luck isn’t bad, we’ll be fine…
Hey Kazuma, Darkness just raised a flag! I’m begging you, please just let me into the carriage!
Exterion!
Hey, why is Iris that strong? Rather, are we even needed?
Iris-sama is a member of royalty you know? Since a long time ago, royalty and powerful nobles have been inheriting the blood of heroes, and as a result, their latent potential skyrockets with each generation. On top of that, they receive the highest quality education in a variety of fields. Adding on to that, they use the highest quality food ingredients without reserve in order to raise their level, and they use weapons inherited from the heroes to fight. Do you know that his majesty and the first prince are currently fighting at the frontlines?
How did I do onii-sama!? I worked hard!
As expected of my little sister. It’s not quite at the level of me, who had laid a lot of demon king army generals to rest, but since you’re so strong, I’ll give you a passing grade. Keep at it!
I don’t know where onii-sama’s confidence come from, but please leave the vanguard to me! Please look closely as I sweep away the monsters using this divine instrument that has been passed on from my ancestors!
Hey, what is that sword? It looks really expensive, and it’s shining with light and stuff.
Are you talking about this? This is a national treasure named Calibur, and apparently, it’s a divine instrument that can protect the bearer from all abnormal effects and curses you know? The sheath was really pretty, so begged my father to give it to me.
Although you are still my underling, this is what I would expect from my left-hand man. If you see a monster, just slash the same way you did just now.
Yes, please leave this to me!
Hey Megumin, what do you mean by ‘underling’ and ‘left-hand man’? Did you do something weird without me noticing? I can’t help but get a bad feeling about this. The only way for you to communicate with Iris should be through mail right?
How disrespectful of you to call this ‘something weird’. We only perform acts of justice. Also, right now, we’re only at the level when my left and right hands have found a hideout, and are starting to expand. Once we become an enormous organization, I will invite you to be my comrade in arms.
As expected of Iris-sama. I didn’t think that you were this strong already. You must have worked hard, haven’t you?
Speaking of which, you used to train me, didn’t you Lalatina? It’s because of that that I am able to be this strong right now. Thank you, Lalatina.
Fufu, I am not worthy of such praise.
But you, didn’t you say that the house Dustiness was one of the families that acted as a guardian for royalty? Rather than protecting, today, you were the one being protected, and you didn’t really do anything either.
!?
W-W-, What are you saying? I just felt that monsters of that level were good combat practice for Iris ok…!?
Onii-sama, Lalatina acts as the guardian of royalty at the crucial times. She is the armor and shield of my nation. There’s no need for her to act for such minor incidents. She will definitely protect me if I ever get into a pinch!
Iris-sama…!
Let’s prepare our lodgings for tonight. Iris-sama, please step aside.
…What is this.
What do you mean by what is this? Could you have possibly thought that the princess of the nation would go sleep in a tent? This is one of the highest-grade magic tools of the nation, which has a monster repelling barrier, and is quite convenient to carry around…
That’s fine already! Rather, are we really needed!?
Onii-sama, is there anything I can help you with?
How could I let the princess-sama help with the cooking? This is a chance to display my skills, so just wait obediently for food to be served.
I can still help even if I’m a princess! Rather, no matter how much I begged the chefs at the castle, they won’t allow me to help them with the food. They kept saying that ‘this is something for subordinates to do’…
Well then why don’t you help me out a little bit? Just a warning, cooking isn’t as easy as it looks, alright? Listen to my instructions carefully, and take care not to hurt yourself alright?
Yes, I understand onii-sama!
Yes-! …cha-han and gyoza? What kind of dish is it?
Fried rice is fried rice. It’s an extremely popular dish that no one in the world dislikes, but since you and Darkness have been sheltered, you probably don’t know about it.
Is it that popular of a dish? It’s a shame that I don’t know about it. Please teach me!
First, we will make the filling for the dumplings! The ingredients for that are cabbage, garlic, and minced meat… OWah—!
Ahh-, the cabbage!
…Alright Iris, cooking is an art where a moment of negligence will prove to be fatal. You have to pay extra attention to that alright?
Kazuma, what kind of dish is this? This is the first time I’ve seen this.
Lalatina, this is an extremely popular dish that not a single person despises, call cha-han. I actually helped make this!
Iris-sama did!? Well then, it seems like you worked hard. I will look forward to it.
Lalatina, this is definitely an extremely popular dish. Despite this ‘cha-han’ dish only being stir-fried, it still has a very rich taste.
There aren’t any high-class ingredients here are there? Why is such a quality dish not served to the likes of nobles? It’s quite strange isn’t it…
Hey Kazuma, leave tomorrow’s’ food to the great Aqua. I will allow the two of them to eat the tastiest dishes.
If that’s the case, leave dinner of the day after to me. I will make the dishes that I ate often back at the Village of Crimson Magic.
Oi Kazuma, this dessert called ‘potato chips’ are quite good.
Now onii-sama, let us cook today as well!
You’re quite motivated aren’t you Iris? I see that you have a bright future ahead of you, so today, I’ll teach you my specialty!
Really!? Thank you very much, I will try my best!
Today’s dinner is Tuna-Mayo rice.
It’s another dish I haven’t heard of. The people around onii-sama are quite well-informed aren’t they!
This is a given for a great archpriest like myself! Just saying, this is a food that you can quickly prepare if you’re crunched for time. For an adventurer who could lose their life with a moment’s hesitation, this is a treasure alright?
I see, so it’s a dish eaten specifically by adventurers!
And it’s done.
It’s quite simple isn’t it!?
You won’t be full with just that, so I prepared some dried-seasoning over rice and raw-egg over rice alright?
Yes, I’m very much looking forward to this!
Lalatina, this dish was made in a mere moment. The entire creation took less than a minute.
Is that true Iris-sama? Oi Kazuma, why didn’t you tell me about such a convenient dish sooner? If you could make such a dish so quickly, then this dish is truly priceless.
It’s not just soy sauce and salt, it’s also tasty with hot sauce alright?
…Aqua, to be honest, I thought you were a useless and ignorant person, but it seems like I can’t read a book by its cover. Please forgive my shallow attitude.
There are a lot of things in this world that you have yet to know about. Since you and Iris are both ojou-samas, it can’t be helped. Someday, I will teach you how to eat the ice cream that is stuck on the cap of a box of ice cream, as well as a bunch of other useful, small skills alright?
Iris, it ran towards your side! By careful not to let it pinch your fingers alright!?
Megumin, this lobster is a bit small. Do we really want to eat it? Isn’t this still a baby lobster? Ah, owowow…
That’s not a baby lobster. Since it doesn’t live in the wide ocean, but in a narrow river, this lobster won’t grow any bigger. Oh-, you can’t escape! With this, I’ve gotten four!
Hey Kazuma, I have something I want to say…
Don’t say it. That girl is catching lobsters, a high-class cuisine that is suitable for a princess-sama, ‘lobster’. Got it?
Maybe it’s because not a lot of people pass through here, but we got a big catch! Tonight’s dinner will be a feast!
This is the first time I’ve gathered food ingredients! So there are also ways like this to enjoy cooking!
M-, Megumin, can you get this thing off of me! At some point, bit on my toe…!
Since the royalty had put a variety of ingredients in the fridge, it would be a waste not to use them. I’ll go prepare something.
Don’t run away on your own. If you do, then the burden of each and every one of us increases.
Now Iris, pay attention alright? Allow me to show you my skill in cooking as well!
Yes, I’ll be in your care!
Usually, you’d let the crayfish sit in water for one night to expunge the dirt, but since these crayfish were caught in a fairly clean river, there wouldn’t be any issues if we eat it as it is.
I will study hard!
Now then, first, we’ll remove pungent smell of the cray… lobster. To do that, we’ll submerge it in sake, uhm, ah, this should be fine.
If you leave it here like this for a while, the pungent smell will be removed and replaced with a fine aroma. Now then, during this time, we’ll prepare for the next step…
Ah, I did everything on my own didn’t I? As for preparations, this should be fine, then…
Kazuma has been on cooking duty all the time recently you see? Occasionally, I want everyone to eat the food I cooked myself. Alright Iris, help divide the dishes ok?
Ah, I understand! Sorry, I was stared absentmindedly and…
Is that so? Since you were looking at your leader’s amazing prowess, I guess it can’t be helped! Now now, I’ll divide the dishes, so Iris, go wash your hands.
Hey, what do you mean by ‘leader’?
…Nothing at all.
––Tasty. The fresh flavor of the lobster we caught seeped into the soup, so it has a rich taste. On top of that, the remaining earthly taste in the lobster is a good match for the salt-grill, so it doesn’t make me feel unpleasant at all. But ultimately, this…!
Hey Kazuma, I want to eat some toad today, so I’ll go and fry some toad from the fridge. You can have my share.
My late grandfather died as he was inspecting the fields of the farm, when he was attacked by a large mob of crayfish. After that, I decided that I would no longer eat shellfish. So that’s why you can have my share, Aqua.
Do you think you can deceive the eyes of a god? I know that when you were sent to the hospital after almost getting run over by the tractor, your grandfather jumped from his seat and rushed there you know? Also, didn’t you eat those snow crimson crabs a while back!?
Like you’re one to talk! What do you mean by ‘I want to eat some toad’? After being eaten by toads so many times, how could you possibly be enthusiastic about eating it!?
Oi, if you have complaints about the secret dish of my clan, why don’t we hear it?
We were just messing around. Of course we’ll eat it.
Ah, we were just a bit too merry about this. This shrimp looks pretty tasty, so let me try it.
…Oho, this is pretty tasty. The shell has been grilled quite nicely as well, and the crayfish broth has seeped into the soup make it amazingly tasty. As expected of a secret recipe, sorry about my lack of respect for cray… lobster dishes.
It was just a joke when I said ‘secret recipe’. Well, above all, I’m glad that you’re happy with it.
—‘Freeze’
Is that you, onii-sama?
Ahh, it’s me, your onii-sama. I couldn’t fall asleep, so I came to get some water.
Uhm, I went to the bathroom, but since its dark, could you bring me to my room?
Alright, leave it to me. Onii-sama will bring you to your room. If you’re scared of sleeping alone, I can sleep with you as well.
I’ll be fine.
At times like this, I would think back to when I went to onii-sama’s room late at night to play around and listen to your stories.
You’re talking about the time where you came to play without Claire’s approval? Thanks to you, Claire was super angry at me the next day you know? Even though it’s not like I brought you outside to play.
But every time I came to play, Onii-sama would patiently tell your stories… I still remember you know? The story where, in onii-sama’s country, a kind, single person that fought against a ‘present of despair’, which was cross-bearing demon called ‘Santa Claus’.
I still remember you know? That onii-sama earned the title of ‘the god of net games’ after battling for multiple nights.
Sorry, did what I say remind onii-sama of your home country?
Nope, I was just thinking that I was really happy everyday back then, and was feeling a bit nostalgic.
It’s good if that’s the case… Uhm
Please continue to stay in my nation. After all, I will try my best to make it one that onii-sama will forever want to live in.
Hey Darkness, this trip is just to meet the little brat that Iris is engaged to right? Then it wouldn’t be a problem to go back immediately after seeing him right?
There’s no way we’ve come to just see them you know? If that’s the case, there wouldn’t be a need to come here in secret, and there’s no point in doing such a thing when the war against the demon king army is intensifying. I’ll be honest with you. This visit is to ask for reinforcements from the neighboring country.
No, a request like that has been sent to all the nations a long time ago. Since my nation is the only one that borders the demon king army’s territory, if we were to be defeated, then the line of defense would be broken, and the weaker nations would immediately be overrun. Because of that, the surrounding countries regularly send elite troops as reinforcements.
However, the nation of Elroad is the only exception. Since it was a nation that was established on casinos, their military forces are weak. As a result, instead of reinforcements, they send us financial support. The majority of our security expenses are covered by this country.
I see. But how is that related to what we’re doing now?
Didn’t I tell you that the war with the demon king army has been intensifying? But there’s another reason behind this truth, Kazuma, and that is because we’ve defeated too many demon king army generals.
Eh, you’re saying that they’re trying to get revenge for defeating their generals?
No, the demon king army has become flustered, so to speak. After all, the demon king army generals that have been undefeated until now are being slain one after another. To add onto that, we are not only increasing our defenses to defend against them, we are also starting to counterattack. However, since Elroad is currently undergoing financial difficulties, rather than providing funds for attacking, they’re planning to stop the defense funding. Thus, in place of the king and the prince who are currently commanding on the front lines, Iris-sama, who is also a member of royalty, has been sent here as a representative.
…I see.
My country has had good relationship with Elroad for a long time. As a militant nation that is estranged with financial matters, our relationship with the financial robust but militarily weak nation of Elroad could be said to be a give and take relationship. Regardless of Elroad’s financial struggles from now on, this visit is crucial to my nation, and might even decide the fate of the world, so don’t do anything unnecessary alright?
… I get it. It’s something for the sake of the world and its people right? I’m also an adventurer that fights against the demon king army, so at times like this, I wouldn’t do anything selfish. I know that it’s pointless for me to meddle in this manner, so you can rest assured ok?
Oi, you, what’s your stare supposed to mean? Are you doubting me?
I can’t bring myself to believe that you would say something like ‘for the sake of the world and its people’… Well fine, once we arrive at Elroad’s castle down, we can take our time to rest. After all, there’s no need to go meet them immediately after arriving. First we’ll take a day to rest. Everything comes after that.
Ah, Kazuma Kazuma, look! We can see Elroad!
Ahahahahahha! That’s it! I’ve always wanted to come here, to the great nation of casinos, Elroad!
Hey Kazuma, the amount of people here are pretty much at the level of Axel during festival time! I mean, where do they get all these people from!?
Oi Aqua, we’re travelling incognito here, so could you not draw so much attention? Don’t forget what we came here for alright?
This is an advertising strategy to make the capital appear as though it’s bustling with activity. Look, you see that guy over there by the corner? I’m pretty sure he turned the corner and came back, which means he’s just an actor. I’m pretty sure he’s being hired to walk around pointlessly.
As expected of your observational skills Kazuma-san. I thought this was a little weird as well, I mean, if this was real, then isn’t the place where we set our base, Axel, practically the countryside?
Stop saying dumb things and be quiet you two. I can’t bear being thought of as a country bumpkin.
Now, this is the hotel that’s been prepared for us. Everyone should go to your rooms and sort your luggage. Iris will meet with the prince tomorrow, so for today, we can take our time to go sightseeing and take a rest from our travels.
I need to prepare for tomorrow’s meeting… since this is my first time meeting the prince, I’m feeling a bit nervous. Perhaps this is the reason I’m feeling stressed. I’ll be resting at the hotel, so everyone should feel free to go sightseeing.
Iris-sama, weren’t you looking forwards to coming here? Since we’re your bodyguards, leaving you behind is a bit…
Y-, You can’t! Please go and relax. Since we’ve come all the way to the nation of casinos, I wouldn’t be able to rest with peace in mind if I keep you holed up in the hotel!
Come on Darkness, Iris has said this much, so let’s just go vent our stress and relax ok?
u… A, Alright…
Casinos! Let’s hit the casinos first! After we win big, we can take the money and go on a feast! I’m sure that they’re selling super expensive saké here as well!
No, we should go to the weapons and armor store here first! I’m sure that we’ll find a super powerful staff that can match up to me!
Mmpf, is it really fine for us to leave Iris-sama alone like that…
As usual, neither of you guys can agree on one thing. Since we came all the way here, why don’t we go sightseeing first? There was a lot to see in the Village of Crimson Magic, so I’m sure that this town…
Oho? What beautiful adventurers. Hey, blonde-haired onee-san over there, why don’t you leave that boring guy alone and come with us?
It’s true, they’re super pretty! I prefer that blue-haired onee-san!
As for me, it would be that pretty black-haired red-eyed girl…
““?
““!?
Hey you guys over there, did you just call us pretty? Did you just call us beautiful? Say it one more time!
Eh… You onee-sans are beautiful and uh… would you like to come with us, um…
Basically, the three of you are saying that – ‘If we could go on a date with a super beautiful girl like you and these two beautiful girls, we’re willing to put our assets and life on the line. That said, why don’t we go on a date?’ – Is that what you wanted to say?
““Not to that extent.
Hey… Could it be that we’ve tried to hit on a weird bunch?
Oi… doesn’t this seem a bit bad? We came all the way here to go sightseeing, but aren’t we spreading our wings a bit too far with this?
N-, No, but although they a bit weird, they’re THAT pretty you know?
Hey Kazuma, what are you going to do? I’m feeling quite troubled by this you know? I was called a pretty lady, and they even asked us out for dates as well. Although Kazuma, who was called ‘boring’ by the three of them is probably already used to it, right? Well, I hope that you’ll come to realize that it’s truly a blessing that you’re able to be in a party with pretty ladies such as ourselves, because if you don’t, your important party members might just go along with these guys you know?
Please go ahead.
“““““Eh
…Uhm, hey Kazuma. Just now, what…
I said ‘please go ahead’. I mean, it’s not like I’m your mom or anything. I don’t want to spend all my time babysitting you. I’d much rather take some time to relax by myself. I honestly don’t think that it’s a crime for me to want to do that every so often.
““Huh-
…Oi, that guy just said ‘babysitting’ didn’t he?
Wait Kazuma, what are you saying all of a sudden! Listen closely alright? I will… No, we will go and play around with those people. Are you not going to feel jealous or depressed…?
Not in the slightest.
He said it like it was nothing!
Wait a moment Megumin. You should know that this man is not the honest-type, right? Fufu, yes, he’s definitely a classic tsundere.
Hey Kazuma, why don’t you be a bit more honest in situations like this? You’ll be going with a pretty lady like me who’ll be hit on like this all the time you know? Would you like to lock arms with me? You might even get a chance to ‘accidentally’ nudge my chest…
I’ll pass. I mean, you’re entire body is just muscle and your chest is probably hard as well.
Ehh-!?
Oi, what do you guys think? That man is a terrible person, but I can’t help but get a bad feeling about this.
Let’s stop. Since we came all the way here to sightsee, I’d rather we not do anything weird…
Y-, You’re right. ‘Let sleeping dogs lie’… there’s such a saying, so let’s give up… ah, even though they’re so pretty, what a waste… U-, Uhm! We have somewhere we need to…
You said that you wanted to go on a date with my companions right?
Huh? Ah-… O-, Owowow…! Hey, I’m sorry, I was lying. It was my bad for trying to hit on your company! It was my bad for saying that you were a boring man! We’ll be going so-!
No no, it’s fine, it’s all fine. My three acquaintances are quite beautiful right? Mhm, mhm, I understand, I really do.
H-, Huh…
You see that blonde-haired armored onee-chan? She’s even more amazing without her armor you know? I mean, just what are those hips man!
The blue-haired onee-chan over there really likes saké you know? If you say that you’ll buy her saké, she’ll be really happy.
As for the black-haired girl… Uhm, you know, she raises a cat, so she probably likes cute things. She might be happy if you bring her somewhere with cute animals to see.
““Th-, Then, we will take you up on your kind offer……
Well then you guys, see ya later. Go all out today and have some fun and vent your stress, ok? That said, don’t cause any trouble for me starting tomorrow alright? After all, you can do whatever you want for today.
““Eh-
Listen up okay? I didn’t bring any spare change with me alright? However, the great Aqua-san will not take any cheap saké ok?
P-, Please leave it to me! The three of us have a lot of money, after all, our relatives are all from upper-class society. If need be, you can leave all your expenses in this town to us!
J-, Just how far are you going to push my expectations… The part where you don’t seem to be putting up a front, but rather, sound completely serious, is really unbearable. I can’t help but feel a chill down my spine… This is just another one of his tricks right? Just a facade, right? …Oi, you guys, just a warning, but don’t try to do anything strange to us. Otherwise, who knows what that man who’s called ‘the brute’ in the town of beginners, Axel, is going to do you?
““Eh
That’s right. Judging by his attitude that allowed him to leave some weak and beautiful girls like us behind without hesitation, just what kind of person do you think he is? If you don’t treat us well, that guy will bare his fangs. Despite how he looks, he has the ability to infiltrate the heavy security of a noble’s mansion, and snipe a target from afar. If you make him your enemy, don’t even think about sleeping.
““!
Hey, don’t say such terrible things about him you two! Kazuma is not that much of a demon. It’s true that he blew up the mansion of an authoritative figure and was labeled a traitor to the nation, and it’s true that he’s someone whose forbidden from entering the capital due to problems he might cause, but…
““………
…Uhm, actually, I think we’ll pass on this, I don’t want to have any ties… Ahhh-!? He ran away~!
““He ran! That guy really left us behind!
This ends here! Take this!
You’re kidding meeeeee!
“““““““OOOOHHH-!
Who the heck is that guy?
I haven’t seen him before, but there’s no way someone as skilled as him could be unknown!
That man’s fierce and relentless assault… Isn’t he similar to the rumored ‘Katarina the Black’?
What, that legend!? No, but I heard that ‘Katarina the Black’ is female…
Wait, look at the way that guy uses his trap card. He might be ‘Kroad the Schemer’…
True. I can’t think of another else other than ‘Kroad the Schemer’ that would use traps in such a way…
You’re my opponent? Fufu, I’ve never seen you before. It seems that you are good at drawing cards, but this isn’t a game where you can win with luck alone you know? Yes, it is a game of wits and strategy. You might be able to beat intermediate players with pure luck, but against me – who has a nickname – you’ll soon meet your end.
—My turn! My turn! It’s forever and ever my turn!!
Demon! Just what is with this guy? That combo is too cruel! The outcome of this match is already decided!
There is a limit to overkilling! Why does he have to go this far! Isn’t the winner already clear!?
Oi, ‘Marinaise the Iron-wall is crying! Someone go stop him already!
Please end this already. I’m sorry for being so cheeky there.
It was a good match. Let’s play again sometime.
Never. Please give me a break.
Next opponent please!
Kyaa-! Someone help—! There’s someone who looked like they turned into a mummy in the sand bath! Is there anyone that can use healing magic!?
Welcome, may I ask if you are alone? If that’s the case, sit anywhere you like on the counter—
My, what a yield we had today! A toast for Elroad!
You got that right. With business going this well already, everything seems to go well no matter what we do. I was worried when I heard that his highness would be leaving on a diplomatic trip for a long period of time, but my, isn’t the prince is a lot more capable than we thought?
But you know, the reason our business is going so well is probably due to the management of the prime minister-sama. Although the idiot prince seems to have the last call on political manners, I heard that he doesn’t do anything but play around all day.
Rather than a toast for Elroad, we should have a toast for the prime minister-dono!
““OOH, a toast to the prime minister—!
Oi, it seems that there’s an amazing artist at Masheran!
Masheran? You mean the super high class store, Masheran? There’s no way an artist could get into that store you know?
Just come with me already! It seems that she’s freely using the equipment from that store as her props!
Welcome.
Uwoah-!? W-, What, is it an earthquake!?
Old man, are you selling any rings? The more expensive the better.
Rings? We don’t sell such high-class goods here, you know? At best, there’s the one for kids over there.
Old man, give me one of this ring!
Ah, you’re back. So, how was your sightseeing?
Kazuma, I know you don’t want to hear this, but I think it would be better for you to know.
…Alright, let’s hear it.
… Erm, first, let’s talk about the person that isn’t here. When he heard that we had just arrived, he said that, ‘in order to soothe our stress from travelling, we should first head to a high-class healthcare facility, and take our time to enjoy ourselves while we’re there.’
When he brought us to the healthcare facility, I noticed that they had my favorite sand bath. When you take a sand bath, you lie down on the floor wearing something called a YU-KA-TA, and then you are buried in heated sand. It’s truly a wonderful experience, but… for some reason, that man thoughtlessly followed my lead and took a sand bath as well. And then he said ‘Alright, I will stay in this longer than Darkness-chan, and show my guts and cool sides!’, so I unconsciously got serious about it as well…
By the time I noticed it, he was practically on the verge of death. The employees there, who had noticed this as well, brought him to the hospital.
…Uhm, right. So, that person said ‘I’ll bring everyone to somewhere nice’ and brought us to a creek outside town… And then he was like ‘Look at this, how’d you like it? This is a famous scenic spot in this town, known as the onion duck breeding grounds. They’re really cute right?’ while looking proudly at the mob of onion ducks. Well, you should know this, but onion ducks are monsters that gives a large amount of experience points, you see? So I was like, ‘why don’t I clean them up in one fell swoop using explosion magic?’… After that, he looked like he received some massive shock, and has been like that ever since…
Uhm, as for Aqua, you see…
After getting dead-drunk in this town’s most high-grade store, this onee-chan said ‘let me show you a super-duper amazing performance!’ and freely used the store’s equipment and started some kind of show. No, it was a truly amazing performance. It really was, but you know, how could anyone have possibly known that there were no special tricks being used at all!? Hey, an entire grand piano completely disappeared after being wrapped in a handkerchief you know? From size alone, there’s no way that it could be hidden in a handkerchief right!?
After that, that high-class store charged us for the equipment and piano that was used in the performance you see… And then, the onion duck cultivation center… I didn’t even ask them to pay the full reparations, all I asked was for them to pay half… Ah! Oi wait, I’ll be scolded by my parents at this rate! Even a third is fine…!
How was Elroad? Did everyone have a good time?
I created a legend in this town you know? As for these people over here, in some other sense, they created a legend as well.
Well then Iris-sama, you must be tired from today’s activities, so why don’t you sleep early tonight in preparation for tomorrow? To allow you to rest comfortably, I’ve requested that your meal be directly sent to your room. Please rest well.
Isn’t it rather early to go to sleep? Well, it’s true that I too want to prepare well for tomorrow, but…
Iris-sama, your meeting tomorrow is of utmost importance. Just for today, I feel that you must absolutely go to sleep early, so that you may display the limits of your beauty tomorrow.
…Is that so? I understand, well then, I will retire early for tonight.
Alright, then let us go to sleep early as well, after all, we have an important meeting tomorrow. Although I feel that it’s rather early, resting when we should is also part of our job as bodyguards!
Kazuma, are you still awake?
I’m awake. The door isn’t locked, so feel free to come in, ok?
I-, Is that so? Then I’ll come in. I have something I want to talk to you about.
W-W-W-, What is with that dress? I can almost see it you know? A variety of things that absolutely shouldn’t be seen, that is.
-!?
Really? Well, this should be normal right? There’s a saying that travels will release the restraints of people. More importantly, here, why don’t we first have a drink?
Ah, no!
‘Wind Breath’
…Hah. Sorry about this Darkness, my hand slipped a little… Well, there is still one more glass isn’t there? I’ll go downstairs and get another one, and have the employees here clean this up tomorrow.
W-, Wait Kazuma. I mean, uhm… One glass is enough isn’t it? To start with, all I was planning to do was pour the saké for you, as a reward for your hard work until now!
Hmm? And what kind of work have I done? Do I look like I’ve been working hard? I, who have done nothing but sleep in everyday?
—N-, No!? Uhm… I mean, didn’t we defeat another demon king army general just a while ago!? The fact that we’ve buried a countless number of demon king army generals is actually an amazing thing you know!?
I believe that we could do all this because you were our party leader. I know we cause you nothing but trouble, but thanks for everything, Kazuma…
That’s what I should be saying. I’m just someone who holds the weakest job of ‘adventurer’. I wouldn’t be able to do anything without you guys. Especially you Darkness. If you weren’t here, our party would’ve probably been wiped several times over. The one who should be rewarded for their work is you. Here, take the glass. I will pour for you.
N-, No no, it’s fine Kazuma. Just your words are enough to satisfy me. Also, I came here for the purpose of rewarding your efforts, so I’ll feel ashamed if I let you host me instead. Come on, let go of the bottle and take the glass. I’ll pour for you.
No no no, how could I let a noble like you pour saké for me? Let me suck up to this ojou-sama every once in a while, otherwise, well, you know, we’re going to the castle as bodyguards tomorrow, right? There’s a chance that we might make some huge mistake. So if I don’t do this, I won’t be able to shamelessly announce your name when the time comes!
Hey, stop being fussy and let go! You always treat me however you like. At this point, do you really think that that kind of makeshift excuse will still work!? In the first place, on our way here, you kept scolding me saying that there was no use for me here, didn’t you!? You always treat me with prejudice, making fun of me by saying that I’m a useless girl, saying that ‘because crusader is a defensive class, there’s no occasion for you to play an active role in anything’!
You should be the one to let go! Despite you having no intention to actually reward me in the first place, I would much rather you ‘reward’ me with ‘service’ rather than saké! Look, this glass is laced with something right? If it’s nothing to feel ashamed of, why don’t you drink it, huh!?
Kuh, i-, it isn’t anything to feel ashamed of! But I’m not going to drink it regardless. After all, this saké is meant as a reward for you! But I see, rather than saké, you prefer my body instead right? Alright then, if you’re going to go as far to say that, then why don’t I reward you with my body!? Go and lie down on the bed!
You… For someone who just tried to drug me, you sure are angry, when it should be the other way around! Alright then, if you’re going to say that, then do reward me!
Come at me!
Y-, You!
Oh, what’s wrong, what’s wrong? Are you really just an ojou-sama who’s all talk!? Well of course, whilst you always call incompetent or worthless, in the end, you’re actually just some ojou-sama that would get embarrassed by a kiss on the cheek!
You’re getting ahead of yourself. How could I let a plebeian like you belittle me! How about I keep to my word, and reward you with my body, hm!?
Ooi, you’re not thinking that this lukewarm massage is actually ‘rewarding me with your body’ right? You get what I mean right? After all, your mind is full of nothing but those dirty fantasies!
Don’t call it dirty fantasies! I am Dustiness Ford Lalatina. I have decided that regardless of the difficulties ahead of me, I will never run away…!
What’s with all this noise, don’t you think you’re being a bit annoying!? Just what the heck are you doing!?
Save me Megumin, I’m being violated!
Aah, y-, you-!?
Geez, just what the heck is going through your mind, Darkness? Although I’m not telling you to stop being in heat, Iris is also staying at this hotel, you know? At the very least, please wait until we get home to do that kind of thing.
Y-, You’re mistaken Megumin! There’s a reason for this!
What is there to misunderstand? You even tried to drug me. The glass was laced with a sleeping drug right? If you weren’t thinking of doing ‘that’, why don’t you drink the saké with the cup you brought? After I fall asleep from the drug, you were planning on ‘amusing yourself’ with my body, am I wrong? After all, you already have a previous offense.
Y-Y-Y-Y-, You’re wr…! That’s not what I was thinking, I have a valid reason for this…
What is there to misunderstand when you’re dressed in such a shameless fashion? Just a little bit more and I’ll be able to see ‘a variety of things’. It futile to say anything Darkness! Come on, just come clean and tell us your true intentions!
This is-, uhm! …uu, this is… because you will undoubtedly do something strange during tomorrow’s meeting, I decided that I would drug you to force you to sleep for a while. But I couldn’t help but feel that it would be pitiful if you stayed asleep the entire time during our stay at the nation of entertainment, so…
I see, so the reason you’re dressed that way is because you intended to give a bit of ‘service’ was it? In any case, you were surely thinking to yourself that ‘keep going like this…!’ and actually looked forward to this just a little bit, right? Geez, you’re such an obscene noble lady aren’t you!?
You’re wro…! U-… U-…, I wouldn’t deny it any longer, I am an obscene noble lady…
Exactly. If Darkness’ dad back in Axel finds out about this, I wonder what he would say? Haa… Haa… Come on, what’s the problem! Say it loud and clear!
Geez, Darkness. I’m not stupid enough to do something that would make trouble for Iris you know? I wouldn’t suddenly attack Iris’ fiancé, so rest assured ok? I merely dislike this engagement that doesn’t align well with my will. When you were forced into a marriage by that lord old man, I came to save you right?
…………-
If Iris really desires this marriage, then I wouldn’t do anything to get in the way. I just dislike the fact that she’s willing to sacrifice herself through this marriage, even if it’s against her true desires. Although there isn’t much I can do if it’s a noble or a princess, I don’t want anyone I know to fall into that kind of situation. I can’t stand it when a female friend becomes another man’s object when they haven’t so much as dated you know?
This man. He sure has the guts to say such a thing when he ditched us in front of those other men.
Agreed. Sometimes, I’d like to see what goes through his head.
That’s because I believe in you guys you know? You guys aren’t easy girls that would get seduced by some random guys that we’ve never seen before, right?
Despite him being so carefree, this man is quite underhanded occasionally.
That’s right. Although he doesn’t seem like the kind of person that would be easily led on by girls, he – as usual – has a silver tongue and is quite crafty with his ways…
I understand Kazuma. As someone who’s continued to refuse matchmaking sessions, I don’t have the right to berate you in any way. If anything happens, I will take responsibility, so do as you please. You will have the backing of my household from here on out.
Claire believed in you enough to entrust you with this? Do you even understand what this is?
Not really, but from your attitude, I can tell that the white-suit nee-chan trusts me a whole lot more than you do.
Kazuma, I believe you as well, so take……uu, t-, take this…
What is it? If you’re going to do it then stop putting on airs and hand it over! Oi, what’s the problem? Let go!
Anyway, just leave everything to me tomorrow. Basically, our main goal for tomorrow is to prevent the defense funding from being cut, and I just need to avoid disturbing the other sides’ mood right? I won’t do anything bad, ok? After all, I’ve decided that I won’t allow any misfortune to befall Iris.
I see… Mm, I suppose that’s right. I understand then, I’ll leave everything to you tomorrow, and I shall entrust Iris-sama to you! If everything goes smoothly, then…
This time around, I wouldn’t thank you with a childish kiss to the cheek, and give you something more real instead…
Woah— Oi, oi, this castle is pretty expensive-looking isn’t it? Darkness, regardless of whether it’s the size of the financial sector or the size of the castle, doesn’t our capital lose to this place in a variety of ways?
This is really something else isn’t it? If I struck this place with explosion magic, I wonder what would happen? I feel like I might start chanting just thinking about it.
Alright Megumin, we can take it from here, so feel free to go back to the hotel, ok?
Hey hey, if I do a performance to change the sign on the castle’s flag to the insignia of the Axis cult, do you think that they’ll be surprised?
Aqua, Aqua. When we get back to Axel, I’ll have house Dustiness donate to the Axis cult, so please act maturely for today.
Alrighty then, let’s see how much of a man that little brat we’re going to meet is. I wonder how long he’ll last under my attacks?
What happened to what you said yesterday!? If you’re planning to do something stupid, then return the pendant that I gave you… Ah-!
Y-Y-, You, where did you just put the pendant of my household! In some sense, it is a family treasure, so…!
Oi, you’ve been pretty noisy for a while now. Just where do you think we are? Not only are we bodyguards, we are also representatives of our nation. Be a bit more conscious of your behavior would you?
Why are you of all people warning me? Ah geez, I’m begging you, just act maturely…!
This is my first meeting with the prince, but I don’t feel nervous at all because everyone is here with me. Thank you everyone.
Look, Iris is completely calm and displaying proper manners. Despite being her retainer, why are you being the noisiest out of all of us?
Y-Y-Y-, You…! Whose fault do you think it is that I’m being noisy…!
Geez, this is why Belzerg’s commoners are so-… Making a fuss in front of the castle, do you even know what etiquette is?
Look, didn’t he just get angry cause Darkness just couldn’t calm down?
Geez, Darkness. We’re facing royalty, you know? This isn’t the place to make a fuss in.
Uhm…
Are you the first prince of Elroad, Revi-sama? I am the first princess of Belzarg, Iris. I came all the way here to see you, so I’m happy that we are able to meet today.
I-, Iris-sama…!
So you’re my fiancé? Although I heard that even the female children of the Belzerg clan are militants, you actually look pretty weak. And here I was thinking that I would see a strong and cool appearance. How disappointing.
Eh-? Ah, uhm… Sorry…
And why do you have so few bodyguards? Is Belzerg really that poor? Instead of only training your muscles, it would be better to put some effort into training your heads so that you can earn some money you know!?
On top of that, your bodyguards aren’t really anything to write home about either. Their age aside, their equipment looks pretty cheap. I’m actually impressed that you managed to get here safely.
If you’re looking for a fight, then I’ll bring it to you.
You’re mistaken! Prince Revi is not familiar with your nation, and doesn’t know about the existence of the Crimson Magic Clan! We weren’t trying to provoke you or belittle you at-…!
Prince, look at them closely! That is a crimson magic clansman! They’re a troublesome group of people that even the demon king is forced to acknowledge. They’re a group of people that don’t understand jokes, so please don’t say any more careless things!
I-, I understand. I’m sorry! It was my mistake, so please stop chanting your magic!
I’ll turn a blind eye this time, but don’t let there be a second time, alright? My name is Megumin, the one who controls explosion magic, and the one who has buried a countless number of demon king army generals. It would be better for you to not anger me.
Understood Megumin-dono. We will work hard to ensure that this never happens again!
I don’t really understand this, but the willingness to apologize is a good thing. When you said that ‘we’re nothing to write home about’, I wanted to give you a taste my holy fist, but I will forgive you this time.
You imbecile, you’re just a mere priest. You dare to…
Prince, prince, she is an Axis cultist. On top of that, considering her blue hair and the way she’s dressed, she must be an extremely passionate one! Axis cultists are said to be more troublesome than tranquility girls and more tenacious than undead.
Hey, I would very much prefer that you stop putting Axis cultists in the same group as tranquility girls and undead! Apologize! Apologize for putting my children in the same rank as monsters!
What is all this noise about?
Prime minister-dono! No, this is…
Nice to meet you. I am the first princess of Belzerg, Iris. I am honored to meet you.
Oh my oh my, from the rumors I’ve heard about the Belzerg clan, I would’ve never imagined that they would have such a cute princess. I am the prime minister of this nation, Ragcraft. I shall be in your care.
Well then, please come this way Iris-sama. I’ve already prepared a warm reception, so…
Wh-, What is it, priest? Is there something about me?
I don’t really get it, but I can’t help but feel that there is something weird about you, uncle. However, you don’t stink like a devil or have the presence of an undead you see… Hey uncle, do you happen to be friends with any devils? Or are you raising an undead as a pet or something like that?
My apologies Ragcraft-dono! This person is well known as a strange person even amongst axis cultists!
No, there’s no helping it if she’s an Axis cultist. Ah, please, I really don’t mind, so…
I-, I ask of you, somehow, please!
Even if you say that, no can do. My nation is currently undergoing financial difficulties. Please look at this party. Even though this is the reception of the princess of our important allied nation, Belzerg, we had no choice but to cut even those costs, and save on accommodations. That’s why, regardless of how much Iris-sama pleads us, we are unable to take the burden of providing defense funding any longer.
However, from what I’ve seen of this nation, I don’t believe that it is undergoing any financial difficulties…
No, that’s just how it appears from a foreign nation’s perspective. All the people of this nation are suffering, and we don’t have anything to spare to support you…
I-, Is that so…
Excuse me, but may I have a word?
O-, Onii-sama?
If I remember correctly, you are one of Iris-sama’s bodyguards. I am currently having an important conversation with her, so could you please wait until later?
No no, I’m her brother after all. Thus, I would like to say something as her guardian.
I see. Iris-sama called you onii-sama, so could it be that you are… I heard that you were supposed to be fighting on the frontlines against the demon king army, so could it be that my information was wrong? Also, that black hair, and black eyes… could it be the hero’s atavism?
Anyway, regardless of who comes to request us, we are unable to provide any more support. My apologies, but please give up on this.
I see… Iris, if that’s the case, why don’t we go and ask prince Revi? If we ask the prince for money, then you wouldn’t mind right?
Wha-!? Didn’t I already say that we don’t have anything to spare? Furthermore, the politics of this nation are under my management, so even if the prince says anything…
I heard this rumor in town, but the prince has decisive authority over the political matters of this nation right? Also, the people in town are praising you you know? Saying that ‘business is going well thanks to the prime minister-dono’ and the like. Wait what what? Business is going well you say? Don’t you get the feeling that something doesn’t add up?
I understand. However, please discuss this matter with the prince himself, as I have no authority to say anything to him.
Prince Revi, how do you do? May I have a word with you?
Now’s a bad time, but what do you want to say? I don’t have anything to say to the Belzerg’s barbaric princess alright?
Oi you little brat, you’re saying quite harsh things to my little sister again, aren’t you? Do you even know what etiquette is? Are you making fun of us? Hey, that isn’t the attitude a fiancé should be showing, right?
O-, Onii-sama!
Wha-!? You imbelice, you dare say such… Onii-sama?
Onii-sama, please don’t act so imprudently. I must procure the defense and expedition funding for my nation. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to reward the adventurers for their efforts. Please, even if it’s just for my sake, could you endure this?
… If you’re going to say that, there’s no way I wouldn’t listen, you know?
My, I’m so sorry for what I said just now. Anyone would get angry if their little sister was belittled in front of them right? Whilst you might’ve made fun of my little sister, I was also in the wrong, so I hope that this will be water under the bridge. The mentally strange crimson magic clansman and axis cultists were just about to make a move, you know?
Hie-!? N-, No, mm. I said too much as well, so let us consider this as water under the bridge.
Actually prince, about the defense and support funding…
No.
I heard about it from Ragcraft. My answer has already been decided. Absolutely ‘no’.
Uhm, may I please ask why? If my nation cannot gain support, and is conquered by the demon king, then the next nation to be targeted will be yours you know.
You don’t need to worry about that. We already have ideas in store. Rather, from today onwards, my nation has no intention of opposing the demon king army. Thus, it will be hard to ask for our cooperation even if it’s not related to funding or support.
That is…! W-, What do you mean? If that’s the case, what will become of the alliance between our nations?
We have our own circumstances. We can continue to be allied, but we do not want to incite the demon king army you see? Ah, also, while we’re at it, let’s dissolve our engagement. In the first place, my parents decided it on their own. To start with, I didn’t want to marry a barbaric Belzerg princess. Once I heard that the ladies were stronger than men there, I decided that there was no way I would marry you.
I don’t care in the slightest about the marriage, but as for your complete refusal to support…!
It doesn’t matter if you show that kind of expression, the answer is still ‘no’, If you consider yourself to be a member of royalty, then… Gu-, wa-, wait stop, I can’t breathe…! Hey, stop…!
Geho-…! W-, What a barbaric girl! As I thought, I made the right choice by dissolving this engagement. This is enough. Since you’re done saying what you need to say, scram!
…I understand
I see. Then…
I will return tomorrow.
…Eh?
I will come visit tomorrow. No, not just tomorrow. I will come visit the day after, and the day after that. Until I managed to secure the support, I will come visit as many times as I need to.
D-, Do as you like!
Yes, I will return!
Oi, you can only bring one bodyguard tomorrow! And don’t bring the crimson magic clansman or the axis cultist! The same goes for the house Dustiness’ lady! You’re only permitted to bring your weak looking brother!
Well then Kazuma, we’ll be going. I feel like I’ll definitely win today, ‘cause when I was drinking tea earlier, the tea stem was floating upright!
Aqua, since sunrise, weren’t you making tea and converting it back into water until the stem stood up?
Kazuma, I’ll leave Iris-sama to you, ok? Although I feel somewhat helpless, but since the other party had told me not to come, it can’t been helped. I will go and investigate this town. At the very least, I should look for information that we can use as leverage in our negotiations.
We’ll be going then. We will absolutely secure the support funding!
Kazuma, sorry I can’t help. I’ll leave the rest to you. Originally, I was supposed to be responsible for this sort of thing…
Don’t worry about it, I’ll do something about this. I said it didn’t I, that I wouldn’t allow any misfortune to befall Iris.
We’ll be going then. If I earn a lot of money, I’ll buy you a souvenir, ok Kazuma!?
By ‘competition’, what does he mean…
Not much. Yesterday, I thought that our negotiations were over. However, you guys said that you wanted it to continue. From my perspective, there’s no merit to be found in further negotiations, but…
I like interesting things. Fight my subordinates here. If you win, then I’ll listen to what you have to say. How’s that, will you accept?
I’ll accept!
Prince Revi, allow me to handle this!
No, allow me! I’ll show this cheeky lady what proper manners are!
Please wait. I am the weakest amongst the knights here. It would only be proper for me to be the first…
Well, just wait up you guys… Oi, are you fine with fighting? Are you sure you don’t want your brother over there to fight instead?
It doesn’t matter. It wouldn’t reach the point where onii-sama would need to make a move. I alone am enough. Well then everyone, feel free to come at me anytime!
It’s not one on one? Even if you’re a princess of the Belzerg clan who are famous for being militants, aren’t you looking down on us too much?
That’s not what I intended… However, I’ll take as on as many opponents as needed. I am prepared for it anytime you see?
‘Exterion’!
…huh?
Iris, if you make their swords unusable, then they can’t practice right? Look, there are practice swords with blunt edges over there. It’s fine if you use those.
Ah! You’re right. My apologies… Sorry, I broke your sword.
Eh-!? N-, No. Uhm… I-, It’s fine, please don’t worry about it…
Well then everyone, please treat me well!
—U-, Uhm, will you listen… to what I have to say?
Yes. Please tell.
Thank you for being willing to listen to what I have to say! Well then…
Wait! I agreed to listen, but I never said that I would support you! Don’t get ahead of yourself!
Oi Iris, those knights are all unconscious, which means that there are no witnesses. Let’s take this chance and bury this guy alive.
Hie-!??
W-, We can’t do that onii-sama. If we do that then we won’t be able to get the money!
…One-tenth.
Eh-?
One-tenth! I’ll give you one-tenth first. M-, Mhm. It’s true that it would be a problem if we cut the support fees all at once. So we will continue to give one-tenth!
N-, No way! One-tenth is a bit…
For a country bumpkin you have entertained me quite well. Consider this a reward! If you desire more money, then satisfy me more!
I understand Well then, please bring some more knights here!
T-, That’s not what I meant! Who said I was going to let you abuse my subordinates! I said for you to entertain me!
To entertain… W-, Well then, uhm, I’ll give you my treasured taketon for a day…
Are you making fun of me!? That has to be some sort of child’s toy, right? That’s not what I meant at all!
Tomorrow! Come here again tomorrow! I’ll prepare an opponent that will surprise you. If you win, then I will increase the budget again. Understood!?
Onii-sama, I only managed to get one-tenth back…
What are you saying? We’re getting one-tenth a day. Then if we go at this pace every day, then after twenty days of threa-… asking him, then we will have two times the original amount. If we think about it this way, then you’ve achieved some amazing results haven’t you?
Although I don’t think that it will be that simple, I feel much better. Onii-sama, please take care of me tomorrow as well.
Leave it to me. Rather, I’ll actually help you starting tomorrow, in a variety of ways.
‘Exterion’!
Y-Y-Y-Y-, You’re kidding me right!?
Fu, it seems that you misjudged my little sister’s strength. Something on the level of a mere griffon is obviously no match for Iris, right?
Y-, You, when you saw the griffon in the cage, weren’t you clamoring about how ‘this is underhanded and clearly against the rules’!
I did it, onii-sama!
O-, Oh. As expected of my little sister. Well done.
Uhm, prince Revi, then as per our agreement…
I-, I get it I get it! I will increase the support funding, so hurry up and put that sword away! Stop pointing its tip towards me!
However, I am merely increasing it. Counting yesterday’s portion, the support funding adds up to one-and-a-half tenths. Now, that’s all for today…
No way! Please at least raise it to two-tenths!
Hie-, don’t point the tip at me… Oi, that’s too close! The point of the sword is pressing against my face! Are you trying to threaten me!?
I’m not trying to threaten you, I just want to negotiate…
Then hurry up and put that sword away!
Then how about a match with me?
J-, Just who would continue to—
Oho? Don’t misunderstand me, alright? If you can’t even beat my little sister, then in a combat-type match against me – who has sent a countless number of demon king army generals to their graves – neither the countries’ knights nor a griffon are my equal. Ah, in that case, you might have no choice but to bring a dragon I guess.
The type of match I’m talking about is games. All said and done, you are the prince of the ‘great nation of casinos’. You like gambling right?
A game contest? If you win, I’ll increase the support funding. Is that what you mean?
Yep. After someone wins in a gambling contest, there’s something called ‘double-up’ right? Would you like to have a go at it with me?
Alright, if I lose, then I will increase the support funding from one-and-a-half tenths to two-tenths. However, if you lose, then what will you pay me with?
I understand, then how about this? If you win, then I will give you a ‘shoulder-massage’ ticket for my little sister
I will work hard!
Are you retarded!? Who would gratefully accept such a thing! If anything, it has to be money! Money! Give me money or something of equal value!
Uhm, then if onii-sama loses, I will let you borrow this taketon for three days…
What are you trying to do with a toy like that!? As if I would want something like that!
Ah that’s enough. How about the support funding going to zero if you guys lose? Not a decrease, but zero. To start with, I followed through with your selfishness under the name of ‘negotiation’, so a compromise of this extent is necessary. Regardless of whether you come everyday from now on, and regardless of how much funding you’ve accumulated, if you lose once, then everything returns to zero. How’s that, still want to do it?
Alright, that’s fine. Then I will decide the contents of our match okay?
The contents are extremely simple. Where is the hundred-eris coin hidden?
…Basically, it’s a pure gambling contest? Are you an idiot? It’s too late to go back on your word alright?
Now that I think about it, onii-sama is someone with unparalleled luck isn’t he!? I see, if that’s the case…!
…What?
This side… No, this side! I choose this fist!
What a shame! You’re wrong!
Damnnnnniiitttt!
We did it onii-sama! With this, we have two-tenths! Two-tenths!
Don’t get ahead of yourselves after a single win alright? Unlike you guys, all I need to do is to win once. Brace yourself for what’s coming tomorrow!
‘Sacred · Lightning · Blare’!
“Hieeeeeeeee—!?“
I did it, onii-sama!
Well done, as expected of my little sister. How’s that? Can you stop giving us these dull tasks already and give us the full aid?
You… Weren’t you shrieking together with me just a moment ago? That aside, if you want the support funding than you will need to keep winning. The current total is two-and-a-half tenths.  Now then, what will you do? Do you still want to have a match with me today?
Hmpf, you have guts! I don’t know how good your luck is, but I am a member of Elroad’s royalty, whom have garnered their fortune from casinos. Just how long do you think you’ll be able to keep winning?
—Now then, we’ve recovered three-tenths of the funds. At this rate, we’ll return to our original rate within the week.
…Should I say ‘as expected’? How should I say this…? Is your powerful luck really something that can’t be used for the sake of the world at this point?
Kazuma-san Kazuma-san. Could you accompany me tomorrow? Come with me to the casino please. For just tomorrow only, I will call you Kazuma-sama ok?
No way. Anyhow, didn’t you gamble away all your spare change yesterday? So what exactly did you do today?
I went to the adventurer’s guild today. Iris subjugated a lot of monsters while we were on our way here right? I, the wise and cunning Aqua, gathered the expensive parts of the monsters you see?
So all you did was sell the parts of the monsters that Iris defeated huh. Oi, I won’t tell you to hand over everything, but give half of it to Iris.
Uhm, onii-sama. Since I’m not an adventurer, I’m unable to sell monster-ingredients for money. So it doesn’t bother me…
It’s fine Iris. If you spoil this girl, she’ll try to push her luck.
I will look after Aqua tomorrow, ok? If we leave her alone she might rack up a debt at the casino.
I don’t have anything more to investigate. So what should I do tomorrow?
Hey Darkness, if that’s the case, come with me tomorrow. As your senpai in casinos, I will teach your everything there is to know.
…You’re not trying to coax me into giving you more allowance are you?
What a shame! You’re wrong!
Whyyyyyyyyyyy!
We did it onii-sama, with this, the defense funding has been entirely restored! After that, is the offense funding that I had originally intended to request…
W-, Wait wait! That funding is a big ‘no’. Leaving the continuation of the defense funding aside, if we provide funds that are used to attack the demon king army, then a variety of problems will arise.
Oi, are you fine with losing to me like this? As the prince of the great nation of casinos, Elroad, are you fine with getting smashed by someone made fun of as a ‘country-bumpkin’ in a gambling contest? Are you really just going to accept this?
Like I would fall for such an obvious taunt. The reason I accepted these matches was because nothing would really change even if I lost to you. If I win, then I’ll be able to publicly announce the cutting of funding for a just cause. However, my nation does not want to agitate the demon king army. Thus, we will not provide any funding that is used for the sake of attacking.
Are you really sure? Perhaps you might win next time?
How heavy-handed of you. Having lost this many times already, do you believe that I honestly think that I still have a chance of winning? Who do you think I am? I’m the prince of the great nation of casinos you… know…?
Onii-sama, could it be that from the first match, the coin was in neither of your hands?
Yeah. My clever little sister, you still remember what I said when I suggested this match right?
What you said? Erm… ‘The contents are extremely simple. Where is hundred-eris coin hidden?’ right? …Ah-!
Ahh-!
Yes, when we first started I said ‘guess where it’s hidden’ didn’t I? I never said to guess ‘which hand it was in’. I simply asked where the coin was. And the crucial point is that the coin was hidden in my back pocket!
Wah! As expected of onii-sama! There’s no one that’s better you at doing sly things like this!
You’re praising me, right?
Mhm, I’m praising you.
Y-, You dirty dirty dirty bastard! To think that you dare would use such tricks against me! Do you have no shame as a member of royalty!?
Not at all.
…Ku-, this is why country-bumpkins are—! Well fine, despite being the prince of the great nation of casinos, I was foolish to have not seen through your trick. I wouldn’t ask you to return the money.
It’s pointless to try to provoke me any further. My nation will continue to provide the defense funding, however, we will not increase it. This is absolute… To be precise, the one who called for the funding to be ceased was Ragcraft you see? The only reason I accepted it was because I didn’t want to be wedded to some country-girl. Well, it’s a shame that I didn’t win in the end, but I had a lot of fun.
Well then, this is goodbye. I’ll be praying for you guys to beat the demon king alright?
—So, that said, I want to let that shitty brat go through some painful experiences.
Alright, well said Kazuma. As if I would just let Elroad, who can’t do anything but earn money, look down on my nation of Belzerg! I’ll beat that little kid to death for making a fool of Iris-sama!
I have no complaints of course. Mm, it doesn’t matter if it’s attacking the castle or anything else, just leave it to me. Even if it’s just an underling, my comrade has been made fun of. A crimson magic clansman will not stand by and watch while such a thing happens.
I don’t really know what’s happening, but I got the monster ingredients from Iris, so as long as it isn’t anything scary, I’ll help you guys out, ok?
That shitty brat, I’ll make sure he regrets having ever looked down on me…!
Hey let us out! What’s our crime!? Tell us what our crime is! This arrest is unjustified!
Y-, You’re asking about your crime…? I never thought that you would say something so shameless, but… Late at night, you guys used some great magic that caused a thunderous roaring sound. Did you really think that no one would be angry?
In the town I live in, I was simply warned that ‘the terrain near the town might change, so please do it somewhere further away’. Isn’t this just the first time I’ve released the magic near this town? The people in this nation are really narrow-minded aren’t they?
You idiot-! If you really want to point fingers, then it’s obviously just the people in your nation that are strange! The people in this town thought that a war started and practically sprang from their beds you know!?
The inspector will arrive in a short moment. If you have anything to say please tell them instead. Well, releasing magic in the middle of the night and waking up all the citizens is not really a severe crime. You guys will probably just be fined, so just act mature and don’t cause any more trouble.
Since someone used explosion magic on the outskirts of town, I quickly rushed to the scene, but when I arrived I found these people being chased by a large mob of undead. As they had left town at that time of day, and decided to use explosion magic to subjugate undead, I decided to arrest them. The report is over there.
This is the nation of Elroad that has flourished from casinos, and it’s not a place that has many particularly villainous criminals. This building in particular is a something like a protection facility for those who are so broke that they have no place to stay or for drunken tourists. A facility that makes sure that such people wouldn’t die from the cold… Now then, let’s have you speak one by one.
Well then, let’s hear what you have to say shall we? …By the way, there is a magic tool here that rings if anyone is lying… As a result, it’s pointless for you to collude your testimonies.
…Hmpf, for whatever it’s worth, I’m still a crusader. In the name of the goddess Eris, I swear that I will not lie.
Your job is ‘crusader’, and you are a believer of the Eris cult… Now then, first, what is your name…
I choose to stay silent.
…Huh?
I said that I choose to stay silent. If you wish to know my name, feel free to torture or interrogate me as you please! However, in the name of the prestigious house Dustiness, I swear that I will not speak easily!
Dustiness-san was it? …Erm, we wouldn’t torture or interrogate you, ok? In a world where there is magic to decipher the truth, those are outdated methods. Please rest assured… House Dustiness… That famous house Dustiness? …It can’t be… However, the bell didn’t ring…?
Now then Dustiness-san, why did you go to that sort of place to cast that magic?
I choose to stay silent. If you wish for me to speak, feel free to use brute force.
…If you choose to stay silent, then I shall assume that there is some crime you are guilty of, you know? I said that I wouldn’t use such outdated methods, but I have the tools to do so. However, I do not feel like using them. Please rest assured, your sentence will be light, so please don’t be stubborn and be forthcoming with me instead. For your information, if I judge that suspects are withholding important information, then I am permitted to use torture. I would recommend that you don’t act rashly…
Just as I like it! Rather, come at me with the most intense methods you can!
…Uhm, that’s enough… next please!
—What is this… A situation where I’m captured and subjected to interrogation and torture… Even though it’s a situation that probably won’t happen another time in my lifetime… To think that it would come to an end so quickly…
You, don’t make others feel troubled because of your fetish.
…Now then, you are the person that casted the magic correct? And if I’m not wrong, your job is ‘archwizard’ right? Now then, first, let’s hear your name.
I am Megumin.
…What did you say?
I am Megumin.
Oi, if you have any problems with my name, let’s hear it, shall we?
N-, No! Please excuse my disrespectful behavior.
Now then, why did you case that disruptive magic in the middle of the night?
I have the duty of ‘one day, one explosion’. Back in Axel, I would cast it as though I was releasing fireworks.
…What will happen if you are unable to perform this ‘one day, one explosion’ duty you speak of?
I don’t even want to think about it. Should it ever come to that, I suppose that ‘KABOOM’ will happen.
Let’s change the question. Regarding the casting of explosion magic in the middle of the night, what do you think of it? Don’t you think that it is a crime in any way?
Not at all, because I believe that there is no doubt that I was a god of destruction in my last life. As a result, destructive activities are wholly justified.
Hey Aqua, you are fascinatingly beautiful today.
Hm hm, what’s up with you all of a sudden? What’s wrong with you, Kazuma? Could it be that when we were getting hit on a while back, you were actually jealous…
…Please do not obstruct the questioning.
Sorry, I was just wondering whether the bell was broken or not… Ow-! Oi stop, what are you doing? I praised you so why are you strangling me! To start with, a while back, to test whether or not the bell was broken or not, didn’t you do the same thing to me?
Let me ask you one more time. Why did you cast explosion magic in the middle of the night?
Because that is the meaning of my life.
………Erm, next please…
—My name is Aqua, ok? I’m something like a manager or guardian for those three over there alright?
Aqua-san… yes? You have the same name as the goddess of water.
Hey, why didn’t that magic tool ring?
As long as the person themselves believes deeply in it, then it’s not a lie. When Megumin said those strange things, the bell didn’t ring right?
Oi, what do you mean by ‘strange things’, let’s hear it shall we?
Let’s hear it then. For what reason were you at such a place at such at time?
That’s because that man over there named Kazuma is in heat all year round. There was no other way to make sure that he wouldn’t start creeping into girl’s beds at night, so to rest assured, we brought him there.
Erm, well then… From your perspective, why did your group cast explosion magic in the middle of the night..?
In order to protect the town from an incoming mob of monsters! Yes, together with those three, I, the great Aqua have protected the town!
…It seems that… you weren’t lying. What is this… You protected this town? You say…?
As the representative of this town, allow me to express my thanks. You are Aqua-san yes? And your job is ‘archpriest’ correct?
Fufu-, ‘archpriest’ is just a front! There is no need for me to hide it anymore. I am none other than the one and only goddess of water! Yes, the goddess Aqua, that is who I am!
Ah, so it’s just broken hm…
Why would you say that—!
Oi, why didn’t the bell ring? Do you have some sort of convenient magic?
That bell can detect the evil intent of people when they lie, and well, I’m a goddess you know? There’s no way I would generate evil intent by lying just a little, right? Even if it does happen, my radiant, divine aura will immediately dissipate it. If it’s going to detect it, I suppose it has to be a huge lie that I absolutely don’t believe in, and that goes against my very morals to say.
…Hm? That means it won’t react unless it’s a huge lie that goes against your will? A while back at the mansion, the bell reacted when you praised me didn’t it? Which basically means that…
Then, last person… please.
—My utmost apologies! I never thought that you were related to the famous houses of Dustiness and Shinfornea!
Well well, the fact that we had released explosion magic in the middle of the night is an unmistakable truth. However… you see? There is an inexplicable reason for doing that. I mean, my nation and your nation are allied and friendly nations right? We’ve come here in secret, so I would like for this not to become a big incident…
Yes, I understand. I fully understand! If this gets out of hand then it will become a problem of foreign affairs! I will not ask for you too deeply for your reason!
Well then, are we free to go home?
Uhm—, about this faulty magic tool, I couldn’t find anything wrong with it, you know? Well, I switched it out just in case but… Oi, we switched this one out, so put this in the storage for me.
… I just wanted to ask, but about the what the blue-haired girl over there said earlier, are you so in heat that you would crawl into girls’ beds at night if those girls put their eyes off of you…
It’s just a lie! Of course all of it was a complete lie!
I-, Is that so? Well in any case, I wouldn’t say anything, so…
U-, Uhm… We believe in you. We believe that even if we were alone and defenseless, you wouldn’t try to do anything to us. Isn’t that good enough?
No one would think that Kazuma would do such a thing. When Kazuma is on watch-duty, I’ve never done anything like sleep lightly as a precaution.
I believe. I believe in him, ok!? Kazuma is not a pervert in the least, and has never crawled into Darkness’ bed at night! I honestly believe that he is a truly kind hearted and extremely sensitive man, ok!? The things that I said back then were all lies!
Chi-ring Chi-ring Chi-ring Chi-ring shut up! So that’s how you perceive me you bastards! But I have some self-consciousness and I’ve reflected on it already, so please don’t say anything more! I’m very sorry!
Onii-sama, thank god you’re safe! When I heard that everyone was arrested, I thought that there might be no choice but for me to break through the prison, even if it means starting a war…
Wait, calm down. It’s fine now, we weren’t mistreated at all!
Well then, why was onii-sama’s group arrested? The hotel employees told me about that you were arrested, but never told me why…
I-, Iris-sama…? Uhm, please forgive me for acting on my own with Kazuma. However, we had good intentions…
…-thetic
…Iris-sama?
…Pathetic.
I’m very sorry Iris-sama, this incident is a result of my lack of virtue. Please…
I said that I’m pathetic. I didn’t do much during our negotiations, and left most of it to onii-sama… And then when my request for additional funds was rejected, all I did was hole up in my room and sulk. Even though I haven’t done anything…
While I was busy sulking, Lalatina and onii-sama exerted yourselves and tried your best, even though that it was I that was supposed to do.
Dustiness Ford Lalatina, I will now go visit the castle. Please come with me.
Iris-sama?
From there, I will appeal to prince Revi for additional funds. Yes…
In the name of the descendants of the hero, Belzerg, I will do whatever it takes, and whatever I must to complete this task!
As expected of Iris-sama! I, Lalatina, will protect you regardless of what happens!
Oi Kazuma, how do you like today’s ‘Iris-sama’! Ah, to see the gallant appearance of the master that I serve… As a noble that protects my nation, nothing could make me happier!
It’s true that today’s Iris is really cool, but your depraved condition is completely cancelling it out. If you still consider yourself a follower, then please act a bit sharper.
Rather, what is Iris planning to do? She said that she would do whatever it takes, but does she mean that? You know, charge straight in and raid the treasury?
What are you saying, you imbecile!? Iris would never do such a thing! …If we’re talking about ‘any methods’, there are a few ways. Rather, when Belzerg was first established, and when there wasn’t enough money, there was something that they would often do…
What are you here for, princess Iris? The prince has commanded that ‘from henceforth, princess Iris and her subjects are not to be allowed into the castle’, so please…
‘Exterion’!
Princess Iris? W-, What are you doing all of a sudden…!
Hyuuiiiiiii—!
Y-Y-Y-Y-, You realize what the consequences of doing this are, right!?
Hey, I said this on our way here, but we’re not really needed here, are we?
S-, Shut up, be quiet! We’re just getting to the good part!
Hey Kazuma, I’m starting to get worried about Emperor Zell, so I want to go home. I’m sure that that child is crying right now because it can’t see me.
I’m pretty sure it forgot about you after taking three steps, so don’t stress about it, ok?
Oi, are you listening, you country-bumpkin!? Since you’ve done such a thing, you’re basically asking for a war between our nations aren’t you!? The other nations that support you will not stay silent you know!? This is a huge foreign affairs prob…!
Prince Revi
I’m only here to have a discussion with you. I apologize for my violent behavior, but as you have said so yourself, my nation is a barbaric one. This is something that is done by an impolite country-bumpkin like myself, so would you please turn a blind eye towards it?
Wh-… As if I would excuse such an idiotic…!
If you refuse to excuse it, then—
With my explosion magic and Iris’ sword, we will destroy this nation—
W-W-W-, What did you say!?
Megumin-san, please don’t interrupt and say such superfluous things! That is not my intention!
Then what do you want from me!? If you want to ask additional funds, even if you threaten me…!
During the establishment of my nation, Belzerg, this is something that the royal family would often do when we didn’t have enough funds…
Please tell me about the strongest, most harmful monster in this nation.
I, Belzerg Stylish Sword Iris, will eradicate it without fail.
Nooooooooooooooooooooo! Nooooooooooooooooooooooo! Noooooooooooooooooooo!
Quit being noisy and shut it! Our opponent can actually be called an opponent this time around! So even if it’s someone like you, we still need you around!
You say that you will eradicate the most harmful monster to this nation? The strongest, mightiest monster? Don’t joke around! I know how strong you are, but isn’t it obvious that it’s impossible!?
It’s not a problem if I can’t do it, is it? I have decided to go defeat this monster on my own, so it’s not a problem even if I die in the process. I will leave a message before I go so…
That’s not what I’m talking about! Even if it’s someone like you, since we’ve held a few conversations before, it would leave a bad taste in my mouth if you die! Don’t go and commit suicide!
Fu, what is there to be afraid of? It might be hard for Iris to face such a powerful monster on her own, but I, Axel’s number one greatest magician, am here as well. Now Iris, let’s go and rout the monster that harms this nation, shall we?
You…-! I’m saying this because you guys have no idea what you’re heading into! Listen, in any case, the ones that brings the greatest amount of damage is the monster living in the gold mine. However, that is-…
Please wait.
Revi-sama, why don’t we let them try? They have stated their desire to do so themselves. Furthermore, if ‘that’ living in the gold mine is eradicated, then we’ll profit from it. Certainly, we must stop the unskilled adventurers and knights from stimulating it, but Iris-sama is a member of the Belzerg clan that inherits the hero’s blood through their veins. In any case, it seems that she will not back down so easily.
…Do whatever you like!
—Isn’t trying to subjugate a dragon stupid? Hey, it is stupid, right? Are you all stupid?
Shut up and just let it go already. There’s no other way, you see? Also, isn’t it about time we got the achievement of being ‘dragon slayers’ as well? I mean, we’ve already fought against demon king army generals and an evil god, so at this point a dragon isn’t really that much is it?
To be fair, aren’t you raising a dragon as a pet anyway? So what is there to be afraid of at this point? Could it be that you’ll abandon Emperor Zell when it grows up?
Please don’t compare my clever child, Emperor Zell, to the likes of the dragon here. That child is very smart, so it won’t attack people you know? And I mean, a wild dragon is basically a retarded lizard right?
Aqua-sama, I will protect everyone, so I will need your help in turn. Since the opponent is a dragon, without your support magic, I think it will be rather tough…
…Geez, I guess it can’t be helped then. I will help you out, so when you grow up and become the queen someday, make the Axis cult the state religion please.
Who would allow such a chaotic thing!? Rather, think of it as a blessing if the Axis cult isn’t completely destroyed instead!
Ah, don’t misunderstand! I’ve always dreamed of doing adventurer-like things like this, and I was just really happy that we we’re like an adventurer party right now…
Geez, we’re not playing around, you know? As a sheltered princess, you can’t be so simple and naïve… Alright, since you are my underling, I will teach you the basics of being an adventurer.
Yes, please take care of me!
…Hmpf, Iris, please look at that. The branches of that tree are broken, right? There’s a high chance that a monster did that not too long ago.
No, my ‘Enemy Detect’ skill isn’t picking anything up, so there probably aren’t any around.
Iris, do you know what is the most important thing for adventurers to have? Yes, it’s water. Amongst all dangers, the situation you’d want to avoid the most is the ‘lack of water’. Thus, there are times where you should try to save the water you’ve brought…
Please leave your water problems to us! Kazuma-san and I can use ‘Create Water’, so please drink to your hearts content!
Iris, there! Look at that, the tree has scars on it! I’ve seen those scars before, it means that there’s a killer-bee nest nearby. Let’s tread lightly so that they don’t come out…
Ah, everyone come and touch me. We’ll move forward using my ‘Hide’ skill. If we do that, we probably won’t be discovered by monsters.
Now then, we’re about to confront a strong enemy, so why don’t we take a break for now? Iris, I’ll teach you about what you need to be aware of when resting in the wilderness. First, do not light a fire in the habitat of brutal monsters, so as to not draw their attention…
Kazuma-san Kazuma-san, can you Tinder this for me? I want to drink some delicious black tea.
You brought a tea set with you? You really can’t be helped huh. Make a cup for me alright? Here, ‘Tinder’.
Uwaahhh!
Waaaahhh—! Hey Megumin what are you doing? Why did you put out the fire!?
Don’t ‘what are you doing?’ me! If you light a fire in this place, won’t you attract monsters? Ever since I started lecturing her, you two have…!
I’m picking up something from my Enemy Detect. Oi, something’s coming!
It’s all because Megumin shouted so loudly!
It’s my fault!? Yes, I totally caused this situation to happen, didn’t I!? I’m so sorry! I might’ve apologized, but I’m not satisfied with this, ok!?
It’s cominggggg!
Kazuma, we’ve hit the jackpot! This is a golden dragon, and amongst all types of dragon, this has the highest sale price! If you eat its meat you’ll jump levels in one go, you can make rare potions from its blood, and you can even make skill-up potions from ingredients made from its parts. You could probably even make highest-quality weapons and gear from its hard horns and scales. It’s practically a mountain of treasure!
Iris-sama! I will draw the dragon’s attention, so please attack it from a safe position! I’m not good at attacking, so…!
Alright Megumin, begin chanting explosion magic! Ideally, I don’t want you to shatter such a precious dragon with your explosion magic, but if Iris has any trouble, don’t hesitate to release it! Aqua, use your magic to support Iris and Darkness! I will attack it from a distance using my bow.
U-U-U-U-, Understood…! W-W-, What, it’s just a d-d-d-d-, dragon, before my explosion magic, it’s no d-d-d-, different from a mere lizard…!
Hey you skimping NEET, don’t just tickle the dragon with your bow and arrow and try to be useful!
Come, golden dragon! I’ll let you witness the power of Dustiness who are called ‘the clan of shields’!
GARRRRRROOO, GRRRRRRRR…!
Sacred · Explode’—!!
The dragon has been subjugated! The golden dragon in the gold mines has been slain by Belzerg’s princess!
I already heard about it! I never thought that you would be able to defeat the golden dragon…!
Uhm, could you please tell me, just a little bit, about how you fought…
It ended with a single strike, alright?
One strike!? O-, One strike…!
Iris, don’t think that you’ve already won alright!? ‘Cause there’s no doubt that my explosion magic would’ve also defeated that dragon! I just didn’t want to blast this precious dragon to smithereens, so I purposely, pur-pose-ly, let you take the credit for this alright!?
I understand. I understand Megumin-san. So please let me go already.
No I won’t! Whatever that ‘Sacred · Explode’ thing was, I can’t forgive you for giving that skill a name that makes it sound like a high-level version of explosion magic. Don’t you dare use it again!
Despite the skill’s name being ‘Sacred · Explode’, it has nothing to do with ‘Explosion’…
How could you possibly say that it’s unrelated!? The name is practically ripped off from explosion magic! Not to mention, the reason behind its massive power is probably because it shares a similar name with ‘Explosion’!
Megumin-san, you’re really annoying! Don’t call the special move that’s been passed down through my clan a ‘rip off’ please! To start with, the special move originates from the swords’ name…!
Did you really do it!?
Yes, here is the dragon’s horn that serves as evidence. Please take a look.
A horn that shines with golden light… There’s no doubt that this is the horn of the golden dragon that lives in the mines…
Please wait.
As expected of the princess who carries the hero’s blood. I can’t blame the demon king army for being afraid of your clan, I suppose… Oi!
…This is?
This is the rewards for the dragon-slaying request. This is an amount that is a fair bit more than the amount we would give to an adventurer. Please take it.
N-, No way…!
W-, Wait Ragcraft! I think that this is too harsh, but… N-, No, I understand. If we give them the increased funding then a variety of problems will occur. I completely understand that, but to give the dragon-slaying hero such a reward is…
Prince, I’ve already explained to you countless times. Originally, it would have been best for us to cut the defense funding entirely, but turning a blind eye to that, granting the attacking funds is something that cannot be done, for the sake of the nation… Iris-sama, I understand your situation, however, we also have our unavoidable circumstance. I hope that you understand.
Uhm… I’m sorry. We also have various troubles, so we cannot give you the money. That’s all there is, please forgive me.
No way…
Uhm, how should I say this… right. Would you like to go to the casino? Given how serious you are, you probably haven’t been to the casinos that are the pride of my nation, right? At the very least, go there and relax yourselves!
Uhm, prince, do you have a moment?
Hm, what is it? Right now, your little sister is more…
I want to talk about the casinos. If we’re going to play, then I want to play around to the fullest before going home. Could you give me a pass to the biggest casino with the highest stakes?
…I’m so useless. I thought that if I worked hard, it would work out… Onii-sama and everyone here helped out, and I promised everyone back at home that I would…
Kazuma, Kazuma. At times like this, should you do something as her onii-chan? That girl might be my underling, but I don’t like it when she’s depressed.
Oi, Iris.
You worked hard, Iris. Mm, you’re a dragon slayer after all. Not to mention, you’ve become a hero as well. You’ve worked harder than anyone, and no one can blame you for this result.
That’s right Iris-sama! It’s as Kazuma says, you’ve worked hard! When we return to the castle, let me, Lalatina, tell the story of how Iris hard strug…!
That’s why, Iris—
Leave the rest to onii-chan
Hey Megumin, those are the ‘headpat’ and ‘dumb smile’ techniques you know? To be specific that man is using the legendary skill where, by patting the head of a girl, and showing her a smile, he can make her fall in love with him.
You little… After you said something cool like that, I was expecting something good, but in the end, it’s this again!?
Even if you say that, I think that this has a considerable chance of success.
What part of it even suggests that! Gambling money to earn money, especially when we need it the most, is obviously wrong, right!? I’m sorry Iris-sama, I was a fool to have trusted this man…
No, Lalatina, I think that this is a good idea.
I-, Iris-sama!?
Iris-sama, please think it through again. You staked your life in order to obtain the dragon’s bounty and the price for its parts. Although it’s still far and away from the additional funds we desired from Elroad, compared to our former, desperate situation, this is…!
Lalatina, the archpriest of the Axis cult, Aqua-sama, once said that: ‘Since it’s pointless anyway, go ahead and try it. If you failed, then just run away.’
Iris-sama, those beliefs are wrong! You can’t allow yourself to be polluted by the Axis cult!
Iris, don’t become a hard-headed girl like her, alright? This is a casino. Casinos are places where you go to have fun.
You imbecile, what do mean by hard-headed girl!
Iris, I’ll tell you this once more. You’re meant to have fun during contests. Also, at times like this, this is what you say. This is the favorite phrase of my friend, who has better luck than me—
Let’s do it!
Ahahahahaha! We won! We’ve won again! Because Kazuma-san has terrific luck! As long as we’re in a casino, I will follow you for the rest of my life!
Oi, don’t put your chips in the same place. What will you do if my good fortune runs away?
Oi, bring me some more coffee.
Y-, Yes, immediately!
I’ve brought it! No, your order has arrived! Please enjoy it!
Good work.
Uhm, esteemed customer…
Hm? What’s up? You can’t tell me that ‘you can’t gamble anymore’ alright? After all, when a customer starts losing enormously, it’s not like you’d tell them to stop gambling, right?
Well, I guess it’s about time we raised the stakes. If I remember correctly, if you get both the color and the number right, the return ratio increases massively right?
Oi, do you know what this is?
…? …T-, That is-!? The insignia of the two great nobles families of the neighboring nation, house Dustiness and house Shinfornea!?
Yes, I’m being backed by these great noble-samas. Do you know what that means? If you don’t allow me to gamble any more, then there’ll be some foreign affairs problems, you know?
Guh-…!
Amazing, onii-sama! I heard that your luck is great, but I never would’ve thought that it would be to this extent! If your luck is this good, rather than being an adventurer, wouldn’t it be fine to amass a fortune from casinos?
No, I don’t want to be a gambler. In order to defeat the demon king, I’d much rather be an adventurer instead.
Now, let’s do this!
I’ll put it here as well ok!?
Ah
You little-! I told you not to put anything! This isn’t a game ok!?
Why can’t I gamble as well you stingy shut-in NEET! I’ve had nothing but losses recently, so let me earn a little back…
Red-5
YOU SEEEEEEEEEEE!?
WAAAH—! My little savings, it’s all gone—!
Hey Darkness, I beg you! If I don’t earn a lot of money here then I won’t be able to buy a gift for Emperor Zell! I’ll pay you back when I win, so let me borrow some!
I’ll buy the gift, so come over here! The future of my nation is at stake you know!?
Kazuma Kazuma, to win back what we lost, let’s go all out! Go and bet all the chips!
Not gonna. Unlike you guys, I’m a prudent person. Ah, what are you trying to do with my chips! Darkness, take this girl away!
Let’s do this!
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san. You were really cool today. You know, I have meant to tell you that for a long time…
No matter how much you praise my I’m not gonna give you an allowance alright? ‘Cause If I give you money then you’ll just mess up my bet… Oh, they’re here they’re here.
Hey you, do you have a moment?
Amazing, onii-sama! To think that you predicted this—!
Right? It’s just as I said. ‘We’ll definitely get ambushed.’ These people are hired by the casino, you know?
Y-, You’re wrong! We’re muggers that came after hearing that you won big! Be obedient and leave the money here, otherwise you’re in for a world of pain. Don’t worry, your life is s…
Alright you guys, capture these guys and use the lie-detecting chi-ring chi-ring magic tool to collect some evidence! I mean, if they’re backed by the casino, then we can blow this event out of proportion and forcibly ‘request’ the funding!
K-, Kazuma, you… Is that why you said we should go through the dark alleyway on our way home? Ah, that’s why you told Aqua to cast support magic, and go to the casino fully equipped…
Oi, isn’t this looking bad for us? I can’t help but feel that we’ve been tricked, but…
More importantly, isn’t that person over there a crimson magic clansman? To add onto that, there are two blonde-haired blue-eyed people. That means that…
Oi, there were nobles! All the nobles are super strong, you know!?
They look like they’re gonna run. Those guys are mountains of treasure, don’t let them get away! You don’t need to hold back, alright? If something happens, we have Aqua for ‘Resurrection’ alright!?
Run! These guys are trouble, they even said that ‘we have Resurrection’! These guys are for real, they’re really gonna do it!
We can’t let them catch us! RUN! RUN!
Wait, don’t leave me behind!
…Hey Kazuma, to say ‘Resurrection’ and things like that, isn’t that a bit too much? Just saying.
Nope, I figured that if I said that they would get scared. I mean, there’s no way I have the guts for… Hey what is it, don’t look at me like that. For real, please stop!
Incoming—!
Esteemed customer? Uhm, due to your immense ability, our business may be forced to close in the near future. We will give you a reward, so please…
This is a state-run casino isn’t it? There’s no way it’d go out of business. It’s fine even if you’re going red in the bankbook, you know? To start with, the prince of this country himself had told me to ‘go to a casino and relax’. Here look, this is the VIP card that I got from the prince.
T-, The prince!? N-, No way, how could it be…
E-E-E-, Esteemed customer. Uhm, actually, the casino is planning to temporarily stop operating starting tomorrow. And well, you see, because you are a regular customer of ours, I felt the need to inform you…
Oh, is that so? Well, until we reach our desired goal, we’ll continue to live here for however many years it takes. However, if the casino stays closed for such a long time, will the country’s revenue books be alright?
However many years…
—Esteemed customer, I beg you! Please! Please no more! I’m being scolded by my superiors every single day, so please forgive me!
I’m telling you, it’s fi~ne, it’s fi~ne. The prince said it’s fine after all. If you got any complaints, bring it to the prince, alright?
I’m begging you, just go home already.
Oi oi, you said to Iris that she should ‘go to the casinos and relax’, right? All we’re doing is relaxing, alright. Once we’re done relaxing we’ll go home.
Wait, if you keep winning like this, then I can’t take this as a joke anymore! With the way it’s going, my nation will have practically given you the additional funding!
You call yourselves ‘the great nation of casinos’, but you’re going to drive the customers that have won big home? What is that supposed to mean, hm? All we’ve done is play around in one of your casinos, so is there a problem?
Gu… That is… my nation also has particular circumstances…
Uhm, what do you mean by ‘particular circumstances’? Why are you unwilling to tell us?
No, this is just…
My nation intends to make a deal with the demon king army.
Ragcraft, you…!
My nation is currently involved in peace negotiations with the demon king army. Should the demon king army defeat your nation, they have promised to leave my nation alone, on the condition that we cut our support for Belzerg.
You bastard, you believe in the words of the demon king army!? Do you have no shame as a human being!?
However, the truth is that Belzerg is unable to overcome the demon king army. As of now, the demon king army and your nation are currently in a stalemate, and the state of the battle is at which no one knows who would win. Thus, pledging our neutrality, and removing ourselves from the state of affairs would not be a bad choice to make as a country’s leader, is it not?
To think that you would trust the demon king…! Listen closely. The demon king is a terrible existence that kidnaps females – even children – and ‘plays’ with them for his own amusement! A terrible existence that kidnaps princesses and female knights, and sexually assaults them with limitless, inexhaustible, and unspeakable methods, such is the demon king!
D-, Don’t say such disrespectful things! No, I mean, where did you hear such rumors? Actually, I am in charge of the negotiations. From my conversations, I feel that the demon king-sama is a rather open-hearted, and trustworthy member of the demon race…
Even if you say that, this saying is actually quite famous… On top off that, I’ve heard that ‘the demon king is a lolicon’, ‘the demon king is the number one pervert on the continent that likes abnormal play’, ‘the demon king is a homo’, and other rumors like that…
Who the heck is spreading such baseless rumors!?
These are rumors that are spread by us, the Axis cult! My children use their own ways to spread my image of the demon king, you see?
Hey, the reason the demon king attacks humanity really isn’t because of you guys, right?
Uhm, prince Revi? I have a good grasp on the situation. The demon king said that, ‘After Belzerg is defeated, I will attack Elroad next. If you don’t want to that to happen, then work together with me’, or something like that, yes? That said, if the prince has thought this through, and has come to this decision for the sake of survival, then I will not object.
Please rest assured. So that the relationship of our nations does not crumble, I will smooth things out with my father… I have faith in my ability to judge people, you know? During our first meeting, I somehow understood that the prince does not truly hate me. You were merely conceited. That’s the feeling I have.
Belzerg’s royalty is strong. Even without the funding, we wouldn’t lose to the demon king army. That’s why…
So please don’t show such a pained expression.
…It seems that I am called an idiot prince by the world.
It seems that people say that I don’t care about politics, and that I spend all my time doing nothing but gambling.
Would you like to have one more contest with me? No tricks this time alright? If you are able to win against me… Then I will bet that Belzerg will beat the demon king!
P-, Prince!?
—Now, which hand is the coin in?
What should I do? Should use steal on that little brat to reveal his lower half in front of Iris? …No, letting Iris see something strange is bad for her growth, however, my opponent might be that kid, but he’s still a prince. I can’t use any rough methods either…
Kazuma, are you here? I have something I want to talk to you about, is now fine?
It’s open—
Excuse me for coming here at this time…
Uhm, can I sit beside you?
G-, Go ahead. What’s come over you today? You can’t fall asleep so you’ve come to play a game with me? If that’s the case, Iris is closer to your level, so go and—
I want you to sleep with me tonight. Uhm, is… that… fine…?
Uhm, Kazuma? I’m, uhm, not as big a Darkness, so as expected, it’s no good… is it?
Nothing like that. I am a man that loves it equally, regardless of whether it’s small or large. Please don’t misjudge me as such a petty man.
I-I-, Is that so. Then… Uhm, It’s embarrassing, so could you close your eyes for a moment?
I refuse.
I-, I feel troubled about your refusal, but… The room is bright you see? So please, for just a little…
…Mm…but, you’re…
…No Dark… I’m… You’re…
-!?
B-B-, But Kazuma, there’s too big of a difference in our social statuses, so it’s not that simple… No, of course I don’t hate you, but—! But, it’s still too early for this, or something like that…
Throw away your status? What are you saying? You’re just a commoner.
Eh-? Huh-?
Rather, you’ve been acting rather strange. To give a specific example, the fact that you’re completely calm when you’re alone in a room with me is tormenting.
N-, No, of course I’m nervous when I’m alone with you. More importantly, my gaze…
…Oi, for a while now, you haven’t been looking at my chest at all. What’s that supposed to mean? Your gaze is so sincere, even in this situation… You bastard, you’re not the real Kazuma, are you!?
Kuh-!
If it’s like this, then you leave me no other choice. I’ll do whatever I can to suppress you-! This is that man’s room, and you’ve noticed that he’s not here, right? If you resist, then who knows what’ll happen to him…!?
Wha…! You bastard, you dare take a hostage, you coward!? W-, What do you plan on doing to me with the rope and handcuffs!? Are you going to tie me up!? Are you planning to handcuff me, tie me up, and do unspeakable things to me!?
No, I don’t plan on doing unspeakable things to you, I just need to keep you restrained… W-, What, you’re unexpectedly honest, aren’t you?
Kuh, it’s fine if you do this to me, but don’t you dare lay a hand on my friends! Ah, the handcuffs are cold…! Oi you, could you use that voice and say ‘Hehe, what an excellent sight to behold, Darkness! You already know what’s gonna happen from here, right?’ with a slightly savage tone to it?
You… N-, No, ok. Hey, I’m trying to tie you up, so stop squirming. Oi, I’m not gonna do anything strange to you, so stop blushing!
I mean, you’re doing this with that face of yours, so…! Oi, what are you planning to do with me? Could it be that you’re planning on locking me into this closet, and…!
…Were you looking at this shameful sight this entire time?
Now then, let me tell you who I am, and why I did such a thing.
My name is Ragcraft. The leader of the demon king army’s intelligence division, Doppelganger Ragcraft. My my, you guys gave me a run for my money.
—And that is what happened thirty years ago. I had finally become a minister of domestic affairs after applying countless number of times during an endless amount of selection periods. From there on, I worked wholeheartedly each and every single day. Useless co-workers who were immersed into casinos. Royalty who were crazy about casinos, and the nobles who loved the casinos just as much. Thanks to their splurging, wasting, and overspending, do you have any idea how hard I was forced to work…? ‘Leaving this country alone would be beneficial to the demon king army, wouldn’t it?’ Do you have any idea how many times I thought that?
Do you get it? All the people of this nation continued live off of the money that the first king had won through gambling, and were driving this country to the brink of collapse. The one who turned that all around was…
’There was no need to do all that’, right?
After arriving at this position, I finally began to move. Yes, the time to act for the sake of the demon king-sama had finally come. Despite the worthless rumors that you imbeciles spread about the demon king-sama, my master is actually a wonderful personwho is worth working for…
Fuu~. I’ve always wanted to tell someone about my long years of complaints and hardship, but I couldn’t until now. Thank you for listening.
Now then, I would like to have my revenge against you guys, who made all my long years of hard work amount to nothing in the end. At first, I really really wanted to kill you, but I thought about it again.
What do you guys hate the most? Yes, that is if that princess Iris is harmed.
Ah, that’s the expression, that’s the expression I wanted to see! HAHAHAHA, I’ll keep you guys here for now. Then, I’ll take your appearance and first go to your companions’ rooms to restrain them in the same manner, tell them the same thing I told you, and then head to princess Iris’ room!
Then I’ll be borrowing your unattractive appearance for just a little longer. FUHAHAHAHAHA, yes, that’s the frustrated expression I wanted to see! Oh joy! Oh joy! What a truly joyful moment this is!!
Fmgh-! Fmgh-!!
Fmm-Fmmm—!
Fmgu-!
-!?
‘Tinder’!
HOTHOTHOTHOTHOTHOAAAHH!
Darkness, I’m going to use ignition magic on you, ok?  Even if I use ‘Tinder’ on the ropes binding my body, the ropes will take a long time to burn, and I might not be able to force them apart while that’s happening, but if it’s you…
‘Tinder’-!
Oi Darkness, where’s Iris’ room!?
I don’t know! The one that assigned the rooms was that prime minister, the only room I know is yours!
By the way, how did you know where I was staying? Also, what time did you come? That prime minister restrained me so that I wouldn’t cause any more trouble, but did he tell you to come to my room?
T-, That is… No, this incident could only be resolved thanks to your help, so… I thought that this time, instead of thanking you with something childish like a kiss on the cheek, I would give you something more earnest…
Ero-! You are just Ero-ness after all! During this kind of emergency, you came to creep into my bed!? Just how much of a depraved lecher are you!?
Y-Y-Y-, You’re mis-! I didn’t plan on going that far! I was just planning on something a bit more soft-…! Also, by the results, I saved you, didn’t I? So isn’t that fine!?
Ah—!
I finally found you you sexually harassing NEET!
So you were here you despicable man! Absolutely despicable! You really are despicable!
Oi you, don’t speak of me like a criminal. I don’t have the time to care about your problems right now. More importantly, do you know where Iris’ room is? This is an emergency situation, so if you know anything, please tell me.
Iris’ room is just ahead, but is there anything you want to explain first? I never thought that Kazuma would try to crawl into Aqua’s bed.
Are you kidding me!? Even I have the right to choose whose bed I want to crawl into you know!?
You went into people’s rooms and tried to sweet talk them, so what are you trying to say now!? Geez, if Megumin didn’t come to my room to play, who knows what you would’ve done!
Oi, you, just bring us to Iris’ room already! Also, there’s no way I would try to assault Aqua, alright? Even when we were sleeping together at the stables I didn’t do anything, you know!? Even in the store I visit often, I never once looked to you for ‘help’ alright!?
Oho-!? You were so passionate just a moment ago, but now that you’ve been rejected, are you so embarrassed that you want to pretend nothing happened!? If you really want to sweet talk me or something like that, use your assets or expensive saké or something! There are a variety of ways, right? If you do that, I even won’t mind linking arms with you!
That was just an fake, a doppelganger! It was just a doppelganger! A doppelganger has infiltrated this castle, and it’s targeting Iris!
Hey, are you saying that the ‘you’ that was praising my hair was just an imposter? Then about the incomprehensible things you said, like ‘If you weren’t an Axis cultist, you would be perfect’, that was…?
‘You’ also told me that ‘If you weren’t a crimson magic clansman, you would be perfect’. Back then, I really wanted to blow ‘you’ up.
‘Exterion’——-!
O-, Onii-sama!?
—I’m truly ashamed!
Uhm, prince Revi, you’re unrelated to the incident, so you don’t need to…
I’m sorry! Either way, I was an idiot. Ah, I can’t complain if I’m called an idiot prince! If it weren’t for princess Iris, my country would’ve fallen to the clutches of the demon king army…
Prince, you’re also a member of royalty, so you can’t lower your head so easily, you know?
I-, I understand, however, as a result of this incident, we owe you a large debt. My nation will never forget Belzerg’s favor. If there are any troubles from here on out, please tell us. Uhm…
‘Cause Belzerg and Elroad are allied and friendly nations after all.
Now then, with this, the incident comes to an end. Everything was wrapped up in an amicable manner and the relationship between our nations has improved. From the results, all’s well, is it not? From today onwards, my nation will be in your care, prince Revi.
Ah, although we can only assist you from behind, please leave it to us. However, everything truly ended well. Not to mention, princess Iris’ brother has also taken good care of me. Although it’s unacceptable to resort to trickery, it was a good social experience.
Since you’ll be my brother someday as well, feel free to think of this castle as your home, and come here to play around anytime.
Why would I become your brother? Are you high? How did you even think of something like that?
………… Eh? No, your princess Iris’ brother right?
Yeah? But we’re not blood related. I’m just her brother in name and duty.
You’re not blood related? W-, Which… means? You’re not prince Jadis? So who the heck are you?
The number one adventurer of Belzerg, Satou Kazuma.
…Ah, you mean you’re brother and sister with special circumstances? Well, in any case, princess Iris admires you like a brother, so I should also…
No no. Didn’t you already cancel your engagement with Iris?
Hey hey, why isn’t that guy not moving? Is he alright?
Uhm, I think it’s best if we just leave him alone for now. Rather Kazuma, there are some things you mustn’t say, alright? Everyone decided to not touch on the subject, so why did you have to tell him?
T-, T-T-, That was… j-, just to keep the distance between my nation and Belzerg. I just wanted princess Iris to hate me, so I didn’t really mean it…! Also, I, too, was tricked by the prime minister, and furthermore, as a sign of our nation’s alliance and friendship…!!
…Belzerg and Elroad will forever and ever be friends, so let’s also be friends forever.
PLEASE WAIIITTTTT!!
Hey, in the end, we really didn’t do any real sightseeing or fun things did we?
The heck are you saying? Out of all of us, you have the highest likelihood of causing a mess wherever we go, so what the heck are you saying?
Hey wait a moment you bed-creeper NEET. If I had some more allowance this trip, I would’ve been able to enjoy myself much more. After we get back to Axel, increase my allowance! If you do that then I’ll take cooking duty for one day ok?
What did you say just now!? Did you just call me a bed-creeper NEET!? I have zero interest in you. How long do you think we’ve slept together in the stables? I didn’t do a single thing to you back then!
Weren’t you making those all those rustling sounds!? I mean, you slept next to a beautiful young woman like myself right? There’s no way you didn’t have any sexual fantasies, you lying NEET!
Ahahahaha-!
Ahahahahaha-! Ahahahahahaha-!
If you want me to forgive you, then take cooking duty for this week alright?
Sure, but be prepared to eat nattō three meals a day okay?
Every day is really fun when you’re around, onii-sama. Thank you for accepting this bodyguard request.
No, it’s fine, I had a lot of fun of as well. The things that shocked me the most is that other than Iris, who has been with me for the shortest time, everyone else failed to see through my imposter. What the heck is wrong with you guys? How long have I been with each of you?
Wait Kazuma, I had-, only I saw through you! I was tricked at first, but I confirmed that it wasn’t you immediately after that you know!?
You’re really not any better. Remember what you tried to get that imposter to do? That guy was actually slightly taken aback by what you did wasn’t he!?
I said this to prince Revi before, but I have confidence in my ability to judge people you see?
Hey Iris, whenever you admire Kazuma by calling him ‘onii-sama’, your eyes are always clouded you know?
Oh, says you, the self-proclaimed ‘cloudless’ Aqua-san. You couldn’t even see through the disguise of a monster, so what should you be called now? Huh?
Right. Iris, you were working the entire time so you didn’t get the chance to visit the town. It’s cheap, but I bought you a gift.
Really? May I really have this?
Yeah, I mean, the ring that you always wore is gone now, isn’t it? The white mark there is really noticeable, so I wanted to buy you something to replace it.
Kazuma Kazuma, do you not have something like that for me as well? I’m a girl of marriageable age, so if you give me something like that, I wouldn’t be dissatisfied either.
Here, this is an Elroad rice cracker. Actually, this is was more expensive than Iris’ ring you know?
Kazuma-san Kazuma-san, what about me? Do you have some gift for me?
As for you, I have this rock that looks like it’s blended with gold. I discovered it during our Dragon subjugation in the gold mines.
Heh-, Ehehehehe…
Onii-sama! Ah, no… Erm, uhm…
Thank you, onii-chan!
—Hey Kazuma, listen to me. Today I did a lot of good deeds that are befitting of someone with a holy job, you know? I was worshipped by a grandpa after casting heal on him, I was praised by children, I sealed the store where a devil is living in, I was thanked by the people in the shopping street, and I performed welfare activities with the church. For my commendable, hard work, could I have some change…
To answer the question ‘what the heck do you do on a daily basis’, I observed you since this morning using my ‘Hide’ skill, you know!? There’s no way in hell you’re a goddess, right!?
—So Lalatina and I are acquaintances from when I was still a child. I admired Lalatina like a sister, and I often walked behind her.
When I was still living in the castle, right? How nostalgic… When Iris-sama was still unable to speak well, I remember playing horsey horsey with her to get her to stop crying somehow…
Just curious, but ‘horsey horsey’ has nothing to do with your special interests right?
Don’t defile Iris-sama and I in your mind! Even I had a time when I was pure and innocent, ok!?
…A-, Are you saying that you’re no longer pure or innocent…?
I’m saying that I’m no longer pure or innocent because of the various things that you’ve done to me! I’ve been seen naked by you. I’ve washed your back. I’ve been tied up by you, and now that I think about it, you’ve even taken off my underwear…!
EEEEHHHHH!?
Geez you, what are you blurting out in front of Iris all of a sudden. Geez, as usual, your mere existence is a detriment to child education.
Y-Y-Y-Y-, You’re mistaken! Iris-sama, that was just a figure of speech of sorts, so…!
N-, Now that I think about it, onii-sama told me about this before, that there was a time where Lalatina washed his back…
What have you been teaching Iris-sama!? Oi, how much did you tell her!
Ah… Lalatina, the Lalatina which I once admired as an onee-sama, has become an adult before I realized it. She’s going to a faraway place now, isn’t she…
You’re mistaken, Iris-sama! Despite what this man has told you, I’m sure that most of it was just accidents and…!
What do you mean by ‘accidents’? Just a little while back, you told me that you couldn’t take off your panties, and in the private space of the bathroom, you even told me to take off your underwear.
Kazuma, I’m begging you, just don’t say anymore!
I-, Iris-sama?
Seeing onii-sama, who I think of as a brother, and Lalatina, who I think of as a sister, fighting like this, it feels like a sibling scuffle.
Iris-sama, this may be lacking in respect, but for the first time in a long while, shall we sleep together like sisters? Fortunately, the room is the highest-class that they have at this hotel, and as you can see, the bed is rather wide…
Yes! It would be just like when we were children… …Uhm, onii-sama? Is there a problem?
No, if we’re going to sleep with the three of us as siblings, then I was going to change into my pajamas.
Go die!
Onii-sama wants to sleep with me as well? Uhm, if Lalatina is fine with that, I don’t really mind…
Iris-sama, do you understand what you’re saying!? I fully realize that it may be rude for me to voice this, but what you said just now was absolutely outrageous and idiotic!
Lalatina, onii-sama is not the kind of person who would do anything when he’s sleeping with someone else. Without the agreement of the other party, he will absolutely not cross the line.
I-, Is that right…
See Darkness? Despite you knowing me for a much longer time, even Iris understands me better. To start with, if the three of us are sleeping together, aren’t you the one who’s most likely to ‘amuse yourself’ in the situation? Listen Iris, this onee-san which you admire as a sister, entered the bath on her own accord despite me being inside it, lured me by saying ‘let’s become adults together’, and suddenly kissed me as well, alright?
Lala-!?
It’s a misun-…! Iris-sama, you’re mistaken! N-, No, It’s… P-, Please don’t look at me like that Iris-samaaaaa!
Oh depraved shNEET! Eat my crimson fist and walk a righteous path in your next life!
… I don’t know why you’re looking for a fight, but since you did it, I might as well take you on.
Owowowowowowow! Please stop, I apologize, so please stop!
So, what was that supposed to mean? If you cursed at me without any particular reason, I’ll use drain touch to absorb your magic power so you can’t do your ‘one day, one explosion’, alright?
P-P-P-P-, Please stop! Y-, Your thoughts are truly fearsome to behold. I think you’re even more devilish than Vanir!
Actually, the Crimson Magic clansmen that live near Axel will occasionally gather together to talk about a variety of things.
…But I can’t think of any Crimson Magic clansmen that have left the village other than you and Yunyun. A bothersome clan like yours should be kept in the isolation facility called the ‘Village of Crimson Magic’ as much as possible.
Whose clan are you calling bothersome!? If we go for an interview with a mercenary or knight group, we’ll immediately be hired! We are Crimson Magic clansmen, who are in great demand no matter what adventurer guild we go to!
So, what does being a part of this so-called ‘Crimson Magic clan’ have to do with cursing me?
Actually, in our next gathering, the Crimson Magic clansmen living nearby will have a showdown to decide who has the coolest signature phrase.
What’s that look supposed to mean!? For Crimson Magic clansmen, choosing a signature phrase is an important duty. In some sense, it is like one’s dying last words, or a quote of a lifetime. Something like that.
So was it your plan for ‘oh depraved shNEET’ or something along those lines to be your quote of a lifetime?
It’s a misunderstanding. That was just me merely stating my thoughts when I saw your depraved and pathetic appearance after waking up.
W-W-W-W-WAIT! I apologize for what I said, so take anything but my magic power!
…Hey, why do I have to accompany you?
Why not? You have free time anyways. Didn’t you waste the entirety of yesterday pulling out the thorns of Aqua’s cactus one by one using tweezers? Today, I’ll allow you to witness my cool side. I will make sure that the household name of ‘Axel’s number one phrase-user’ falls into my hands.
There was a meaning behind that you know? Not only did I kill a lot of time, I even got to see Aqua, who had sneakily drank the high-class neroid that I treated with utmost care, bawling.
After that, Aqua kept spamming ‘Heal’ on the cactus. When I saw it this morning, it had multiplied several times in size. A grown cactus is really clever, so if you get close to it from now on, it’ll probably send thorns flying at you.
Hm? Kazuma-san? H-, Hey Megumin, why did you bring Kazuma-san with you!?
Well met. It appeared to me that this man was quite lacking in understanding of the importance of signature phrases for us Crimson Magic clansmen, so I forcibly brought him along.
Stop! It’s embarrassing! I don’t really understand the importance of it either, so don’t drag an ordinary person like Kazuma-san into this!
Geez, you’re too loud Yunyun. I never said that Kazuma was going to join, did I?
AHHH I’m so sorry! Kazuma-san, I’m so sorry, it’s my fault!
—Well then, it’s unanimously decided that Satou Kazuma, who joined at the last minute, has the coolest signature phrase!
Why is Kazuma number one here!? Isn’t this weird? Hey isn’t this weird!? There’s no way he could dish out such cool signature phrases like that in such a ‘bang bang bang bang’ manner!
The sickness that spreads through you guys is incomparable to the one that spreads in my nation. There’s no way that the chuunibyou-stained phrases left by my ancestors would ever lose.
One more time! Please say those things that you said just now one more time please!
Ahahahaha! Ahahahahaha! Hey Kazuma, look at this! I used the flyers from the shopping street to make that weirdo devil’s mask!
Buahahaha! What the heck is this? If you didn’t tell, I would’ve never thought that this was made of flyers! You really are good at this kind of thing!
Fuahahahah! The devil that sees through all shall hence announce: Thou, who looks soberly looks upon us beholding an amused expression, who is a lady who possesses large biceps; the digestion of alcohol requires protein. If thou shouldst drink more, then the hard muscles that troubled thee may soften somewhat.
Buhahahahaha! That’s just like him!
S-, Shut up you drunkards! And Aqua, don’t say that I have hard muscles!
Just let me drink already! I’m already of marriageable age, so why am I still being treated like a child!!?
Ahyahyahyahyahyahyhya! Good one-!
That’s not a ‘good one’! Hey, what’s so funny, you drunkard! Hand over the bottle you’re holding please! …Ah, what are you doing with your hand, give it! Hng, agh, hiyahhhhhhhhhh!?
Ahahahahah, Ahahahahaha! Good one-!
There’s nothing good about that! Hey, I said that there’s nothing good about that, you hear me!? And what the heck are you doing Kazuma!? If you take away my magic power then I won’t be able to use explosion magic today, won’t I!? You’ll return it later right!?
Good one-!
This guy!
Kazuma-san Kazuma-san, let’s drink all the wine they have in this castle!
Alrighty then, let’s fill me upper’ then I’ll show you all a ‘Create Water’ where you don’t need to use magic power at all!
You friggin scumbag! How dare you say such a dirty joke!
Hey Kazuma, I had a lot of fun today! I mean, this is the first time that our hard work and accomplishments have actually been recognized this well!
You got that right! For whatever reason, when we actually got down and did stuff in the past, we would end up with even more debt or in some kind of crazy situation. Even in the best case all we got were some money or awards or whatever!
Well done Kazuma‑dono, I have truly misunderstood you! What you’ve achieved this time was far beyond my expectations!
No, this was all due to Iris’ hard work. I only did a few things to assist her.
Such humility… To be honest, I wouldn’t have cared if the funds were completely cut as long as Iris‑sama’s engagement was called off. With that in mind, for you to manage to get the funding whilst also voiding the engagement, as well as saving Elroad from a desperate situation to get them to owe us a favor is…!
Claire! Which is more important, my engagement or the nation’s funding!? If we weren’t able to get these funds, then we wouldn’t be able to fight against the demon king army, you know!?
Of course the matter of your engagement is more important, Iris‑sama. As long as you are safe, the demon king army can do whatever they—OWOWOW! Iris‑sama, have you become more violent since returning!?
Either way, it’s a job well done. You can have whatever you like for your rewards, just name it.
Didn’t we already decide on the reward?
Now that I think about it, that is the case Kazuma‑dono… Let me treat you all to a banquet to commend your efforts then . I shall give you your reward then, Kazuma‑dono.
I won’t let you sleep tonight, alright?
Eh-!?
—What’s up with this chick, she can’t drink at all!
Uuuh, Kazuma-dono, m-, my apologies…
Since when did Onii-sama and Claire get along so well?
Oh, what is it Iris? Are you jealous? It’s alright, onii-chan’s type is beautiful and busty onee-sans. So…
Onii-sama, what do you plan on doing after this banquet? Are you going back to Axel so soon?
Hmm, now that you ask… Recently, I’ve been doing nothing but subjugating evil gods and being your bodyguard. So I think it’s about time to take a good long break.
If you’d like to take a rest, couldn’t you do it here? There are a lot of empty rooms, and you’re also in no rush to head home, right?
Well, if you say that, I guess it won’t hurt to stay here a little longer.
I’m glad that Iris yearns for me this much, but this is a dangerous decision to make…
If it’s possible…
If it’s possible, I’d like to live with everyone…
Good morning, Dragon Slayer.
Onii‑sama, please don’t call me ‘Dragon Slayer’… I know that’s what the residents of the capital have all been calling me, but I wish they would switch to another title too…
Look, Iris, even though you say that, the title of ‘Dragon Slayer’ isn’t something you hear every day. Isn’t this worth celebrating on a national scale? Remember how Claire could barely catch her breath out of excitement when she exclaimed ‘I always knew princess Iris was capable of great deeds’?
Please don’t mind Claire, she had recently come to me quite a few times to hear my heroic dragon slaying tales.
All right! I love mayo salmon!
See you later then, onii‑sama!
…Even you came along? But it’s forbidden for the princess of a nation to enter the dangerous suburbs.
Being the Dragon Slayer has earned me certain excursion privileges, worry not. Besides, since very strong monsters lurk near the capital, I’m worried for onii‑sama’s safety.
Big Boss
Kazuma, we’ve arrived! Here it is: the explosion spot I’m so fond of. Beyond the rock field lies a gathering spot for monsters. A good shot there would also conveniently net me experience points.
Well let’s be done with it and go back soon… By the way, what do you two think of me?
What are you saying so suddenly? What do you mean what do we think of you? Have you been a little too bored lately? All I’ve seen of you has been unusual behavior. You better stop going with Aqua to bush-sculpting in the courtyard; while Aqua’s works looked beautiful and were rated highly, Kazuma’s dog-bush was strongly disliked.
Onii‑sama, no matter how bored you feel, I still hope you would refrain from instructing the soldiers in training. I wouldn’t have minded if onii‑sama were skilled, but as it stands, the soldiers are already calling you ‘the strange guest who pretends to be a teacher despite often losing’…
Don’t mind what I’ve been doing lately, I was just bored! No, uhm… Look, there must be plenty more to say about me, such as whether you have feelings for me. Just say how much you like me, I want to hear you two say it yourselves!
Why does it matter? As I said, I like Kazuma. Why ask this all of the sudden?
I-I also uhm…l-like…onii‑sama…
Okay, I see; onii‑san’s in the wrong. Iris, I’m satisfied with your effort. And Megumin, I’m happy to verify your view of me.
What is going on? Did Kazuma hit his head today? As if he wasn’t odd enough already, what he had been saying was even stranger.
O-or in other words, onii‑sama has been acting quite disgusting…
Iris, shh! Don’t say stuff like that, even if you know it’s true!
Worry not, you two; I’m a very generous man who would never leave one side out.
Iris, for some reason I feel furious right now. Why don’t we knock some sense into him before our daily explosions?
Onii‑sama is really quite disgusting today. Did you hit your head somewhere?
Heidel! Heidel!
How may I help you, Satou‑sama? Is it your morning coffee? Or do you wish to have breakfast in bed? Today’s breakfast is exactly as Satou‑sama had requested: goose liver miso soup.
Breakfast will be in bed. A coffee before that would also be great. On top of that…
Tell the maid Mary to put on a shorter skirt before coming, is it?
I expected nothing less, Heidel. I’m glad you memorized my preferences.
It is my pleasure to have my name remembered, sir. To make punishing Mary easier, I have repositioned the vase so that it would fall over more easily.
Lots of snow sprites this year; the winter’s gonna be harsh. Will the Adventurer’s Guild raise the rewards for eliminating snow sprites…? Heidel, this will surely affect this year’s harvest of farm products. Make an investment on my account in profitable farm products.
Understood, Satou‑sama. Which types of produce shall we purchase?
…Erm, just…buy the ones that’d be hit hard. The type that would see less harvest with cold.
Understood, I shall decide for you then.
Well then, that’ll be that. So, what are the plans for today?
The events in the morning are as follows. First up is checking out the contents of the treasure storeroom with Aqua‑sama while disguised as the quality inspectors. Later, Aqua‑sama will use her party tricks in the courtyard and pull an Amano-Iwato(Japanese mythology. Involves throwing a party and dancing lewdly to distract guards.)to preven—…invite Iris‑sama, who would be busy studying, out to play.
—Going in the afternoon with Megumin‑sama to her daily explosion experiments in the suburbs; after that, inspecting armouries around the capital with Lady Dustiness.
Gee, today sure is busy. What’s for tonight?
The evening is currently free; on another note, Lady Dustiness has been invited to a gala. What do you think?
Of course I would sneak into the gala…to foil other men’s flirtation with Darkness.
Understood. I’ll make the preparations.
—Good morning Satou‑sama. Today’s breakfast is exactly as Satou‑sama had requested; a miso soup with extra truffle. What do you think of it?
Tastes like miso.
Is that so. I’ll go prepare your coffee then, please enjoy your soup.
Heidel, the plans for today are…?
The itinerary for today is as follows. Going in the morning with Megumin‑sama to protest at the capital’s newspaper bureau and force them to publish a special documentary on Satou‑sama and Megumin‑sama. After that, Aqua‑sama invited you to participate in her Axis sermon. In the afternoon, Iris‑sama and Lady Dustiness wishes to go on a monster hunting quest with you around the capital. Finally, attending a night sky explosion show hosted by Megumin‑sama in the evening.
Let’s cancel the afternoon quest. Tell Iris I’ll show my true abilities starting tomorrow. Instead, let Megumin do her explosion show earlier, in that time slot. Darkness will likely be invited to another party tonight, gotta be there.
Certainly, as you wish. By the way, Lady Dustiness wants me to tell you to not sneak into her parties…
You’re not getting the point, Heidel. It’s something called pride, to say ‘hate’ when they really mean ‘like’. In other words, by telling me to not go, Darkness in fact wants me there.
Is that so? I indeed lack experience. Heidel respects your guidance. Since going unarmed lacks shock value, I’ll go prepare a party-sized cake and make this a surprise for Lady Dustiness!
Not bad, let’s go with that… Wait, no, we could still make this more interesting. Let’s do it this way; you make me a hollow cake big enough to fit me inside, then I’ll be delivered to the event unnoticed. Just as everyone ponders who had brought the cake, it would crack down the middle and I would emerge spectacularly. How does it sound?
Genius indeed, Satou‑sama! I could already picture the guests standing there dumbstruck. I’ll start the preparation at once.
Good morning, Satou‑sama. Today’s breakfast, by Satou‑sama’s request, will be caviar miso soup.
Heidel, thank you for all you’ve done for me. I truly am grateful… However, I am dissatisfied with but one thing in everyday life.
My sincerest apologies, Satou‑sama. Heidel had actually been aware of Satou‑sama’s annoyances.
Were you unhappy with the quality of your miso soup?
Not that, not at all! Now that you mention it, the miso soup did indeed taste strange. I only asked for food made with high-grade ingredients in general, not to have them all be added to my miso soup! When I say I wanted saltier soup, I didn’t ask for caviar!
I’d say… Have people here been seeing me as only trouble?
…………I do not believe that is true.
What’s with that suspicious pause? Why couldn’t you answer more decisively!? Don’t avoid my sight, what are you implying!?
how much longer does this guy plan to stay
Does Satou‑sama have a clue?
How should I know? Was it from that time when I snuck into Darkness’ party in a cake? Didn’t that end with the cake being returned with me still inside due to no one being willing to eat such a shady cake…? Other than that, I could only think of Iris.
Let’s go back.
Rejected.
…What do you think? Why not take that child’s suggestion and actually rest? You too, Aqua. Let’s stop with the whining and have a read.
Now that’s the Kazuma I teamed up with. So, please bear with me; If the worse comes to worst, I’ll still be there to praise you back in Axel.
…Seems like the person only good at seduction and threats has improved. When you put it that way, I feel bad for staying. Not gonna lie, I’m hard to convince. You’d better live up to your promise when we get back.
Alright, you can count on me! Want me to clean your back again?
Oi, there’s been a lot of PDA between you two lately. Remember where we are. Shouldn’t that wait till we get back?
What do you mean PDA!? Y-you see, I’ve talked to Kazuma on the trip about this, but until now, I haven’t done anything to thank him for all his help… So, as a noble, I must…uhm…
You’re blatantly older than me, so what’s the hold up!? At this stage, rather than talking about cleaning backs, isn’t it about time for you to confess as well, Darkness? Your night raids have all gone south, so why don’t you just say your feelings loud and clear like me!? That way I’d also be justified in eliminating you!
I’m being eliminated!? My feelings are not like Megumin’s… Besides, I bear the name of a noble, my family would not like me choosing a partner of commoner status…
Before, you were adamantly refusing to date, so aren’t you ashamed of still using familial matters as an excuse? You too, Kazuma, give her a piece of your… Kazuma? What have you been mumbling about just now?
Still I could watch this for about an hour or so.
Look at this guy!
I’ve made up my mind, Kazuma!
Let’s think back to our roots, shall we? That’s right, our hope was to defeat the unholy Demon King and bring about world peace! These children’s letters reminded me of my true duty! Alright, Kazuma, let’s go level up back in Axel! Guiding you, the weakling, from zero to hero is my obligation as a goddess! It’s time for the Goddess of Water to cast light upon these children’ future!
I get it, Aqua. When we go back to Axel, we’ll return to our roots and do quests for the Adventurers Guild. After we get back in the swing of it, we shall show the Demon King who’s boss. People are closely watching our actions. Since the children are cheering for us, what excuse do we have to not give it our all?
Not bad for Kazuma, who recently got the title of ‘Lolizuma’!
Hey, who the hell called me that!? ‘Scumzuma’ or ‘Kazutrash’ I could care less about, but not that!
It’s been a long time since onii‑sama came to my room. Make yourself comfortable, I’ll go fetch Claire’s dessert.
Oi, what’s with the secrecy. My, are you hiding an ero-magazine? Actually, Iris is about the age for that stuff. Though you ought to hide it better, or else your servants will surely toss it out.
Not at all, it’s nothing like that! I’ve been hiding this, the ring!
If I wore this, Claire would certainly disapprove of its cheapness as unfitting of royalty and confiscate it. So, I could only wear it during sleep…
I knew I should’ve bought a more expensive one. Money was no problem, but this was the only kind for sale. Apologies, better quality would’ve saved you a lot of hardship.
No, I do like it. While expensive rings have big, brilliant gems, this small one is very cute.
A-as long as you like it. That aside, what do you wish to play tonight? …No, hold on; I bought card game sets from Elroad, I’ll let you play with my secondary deck.
Wait, let’s not play games tonight. Since we rarely have some alone time, I want to hear onii‑sama’s stories.
—And this is what I told him: ‘Someone who also plays this game during work or school couldn’t be my enemy. Join our guild, I say, Here you shall meet real friends…’ And that’s how the strongest, most famous hikiNEET switched to our guild, making us truly, indisputably the biggest guild yet. Ever since then… Well, many things happened that led to its collapse. What happened afterwards we’ll save for next time.
Wait, onii‑sama is going back tomorrow, who knows when next time will be! What really happened, please tell me at least the beginning!
Guess it really can’t be helped. Just the beginning, all right? …Once upon a time, our guild had a new member called ‘Dark † Angel’. This new girl was the beginning of the end for our guild.
Wait, this beginning is too interesting to leave the rest for next time! What did that woman do!? I can’t sleep without knowing this!
I don’t want to go too much into detail… To summarize the gist, I guess I’ll use the singular word ‘princess’.
Princess, huh? …Eh!? Unless you’re saying this Princess‑sama became lovers with someone in the guild…?
Impressive thinking. Indeed, that princess stirred up big problems.
Is that so; after all, they do have a great difference in status…
Uhm, please take this. Big Boss…I mean, Megumin taught me how to make it. She says it is a traditional crimson demon lucky charm. Since onii‑sama often winds up in grave situations, I thought I might try and make one…
Many thanks. I prefer a quiet life too, but troubles always seek me out; furthermore, the source of those troubles are often my own teammates.
After onii‑sama goes back, I won’t be able to adventure anymore… So please, at least take the charm with you.
—All right. We got a bit carried away with my storytelling. It’s quite late, too; I should head to bed soon.
…Don’t.
E-even if you say that, nothing could change. Don’t worry, I’ll be back. If anyone stops me, be it Claire or some guards, I still have the pendant that Darkness lent me. Although Claire retrieved her coat of arms, the Dustiness symbol is all I need to traverse the capital to my heart’s content. So…
I forbid! ‘Visiting occasionally’ is not enough. I know I said that you could take the charm along in my stead, but I still rather go myself. I still want to adventure together with onii‑sama, experience all the world has to offer!
Please keep teaching me all sorts of things! In the twelve years I’ve lived in this castle, the short time I’ve adventured with onii‑sama felt infinitely more accomplishing and wonderful. Please don’t leave me. Together, we…
dragon slayer
Excuse me, I got headstrong again… I couldn’t help but turn childish whenever I’m with onii‑sama. I’m still very much the princess of a nation; I have an obligation to protect the people.
Iris, you’re only twelve, it’s fine to act cutesy. Wasn’t this said before? You’re of royalty, it’s no issue to be slightly headstrong towards the people around you.
Onii‑sama, please don’t spoil me so. If we kept living together, I’m afraid I’d say something far more willful than wanting you to stay longer.
Until the day onii‑sama defeats the Demon King, I promise I won’t act cutesy or headstrong. So…
…so, for only tonight, please spoil me just a little.
I-I don’t really mind; forget about tonight, you can be cutesy around me anytime!
I’ll stay instead
Onii‑sama…no,
Onii‑chan,
I like you so much…!
snap out of it
Kazuma‑dono, you have a second to talk?
What’s the matter Claire? Something important?
What’s the matter? What a great question, Kazuma‑dono, I think you know exactly why I’m here.
You do know what people here in the castle think of you, right?
Obviously. Even though heartless insults fill the air, I have no problems with it, for my will cannot be damaged by such petty cause. I’m the kind of person who persisted to be a NEET despite the countless lecturing and mockery from my relatives on every New Year’s Eve and Bon festival.
Really. Well that’s simply perfect, since I have a request for Your Excellency who has such endurant willpower and has made such great contributions to the country.
What’s the matter? How could I help?
Of course! It’s something only you could accomplish!
Long time no see, Kazuma‑dono.
Uhm… I know how hard Kazuma‑dono worked to help Princess Iris over in Elroad, how Kazuma‑dono stayed to tell Princess Iris stories every night, and how Her Highness has consequently become quite extroverted and joyful…
Indeed, she looks very happy everyday, and I have you to thank for that. We couldn’t imagine how restless Princess Iris must have been in secret as someone who is so young yet lives in a castle that could be under siege from Demon King’s army at any moment.
‘Sup, Onii‑chan? Sleeping in this late ain’t good, yanno? The weather’s lit  AF today, so let’s grab some bentos for a picnic, Kazzi!
Kazuma‑dono, I beg you, please go back!
—He ran that way! Get him!
Don’t underestimate him because he’s only one person! He has defeated numerous demon generals and high-bounty criminals, Eris knows what he has up his sleeve!
Visitor, we cannot let you proceed!
Please stop your futile resistance and obey…!
Create Earth!
Wh-what are you doing?
Wind Breath!
!? Whaa!?
My eyes…!
Create Water!
Wharrgarbl!
K-Kazuma‑dono! That style of combat… could you be…!
…For goodness sake, how could I been so blind.
Such a shame, Claire. It has been a pleasure drinking with you while listening to you tell stories about Iris’ childhood.  Had things not come down to this, we would’ve definitely made great friends.
Kazuma‑dono…I also regret having to bid farewell in this manner. That aside, I must thank you for one more thing: thank you for protecting Princess Iris from the dangerous divine item. However…
…However?
However, it is unacceptable to steal Princess Iris’ ring. Please return it. The ring is not something you’re allowed to possess. Should you refuse to return it, I’m afraid we’ll have to retaliate by publicizing your secret identity. This will be necessary despite inevitably upsetting Princess Iris. If you wish to remain anonymous, obey and…
There’s no way you would publicize it. After all, the fact that someone who Iris‑sama calls brother is a chivalrous thief would be a massive disgrace to her royal image. Let me pass now, White Suit, or I won’t hesitate to torture you to tears.
…W-what do you mean?
I shall Bind you with this rope, then repeatedly use Steal until you cry in submission.
Eh!? W-wait! Hold it Kazuma‑dono, despite everything, I’m still a noble woman! You wouldn’t do…something…thatextreme in public…would you?
By the way, I’ve done things like tying Darkness up and dragging her after a carriage and blasting her with icy water. Decide for yourself whether to believe it or not.
Retreat!!!
Leave this to us, Claire‑sama! We’ll take on that man…!
Alright, Mr. Guest, please comply now and—!?
Bind!
Got you!
Wind Breath!
They’re all but little tricks! No fear, push on!
W-wait up! Don’t, he is…!
!?
Stop right here Kazuma‑dono, you have been surrounded! I shall teleport you back with magic; see you in Axel!
Come on, Kazuma‑dono. Please surrender and leave… During this hour-long chase, many were injured by slipping on frozen floors, many are still incapacitated by Bind, and some are even unconscious from being drained of mana using unknown methods… What an accomplishment for a lone adventurer; you’re almost like the thief that infiltrated the castle some time ago…
Ha…Ha…Wh…what an unbelievable guy… It’s no longer hard to see how Mitsurugi‑dono lost to you twice. Still, just what abilities would one need to detect our movement, escape ahead of time and disappear to nowhere whenever he gets cornered…?
Say, Rain, why don’t we make a deal.
As I recall, Rain came from a minor noble family, right? As you know, I have deep, emotional ties with Darkness, even her father has a good impression of me. He appreciates me enough to entrust Darkness with me. They trust me to the extent of lending me all the pendants and coats of arms of the Dustiness family.
Quiet! Don’t listen to his bullshit, don’t be deceived by that man, Rain!
…Besides, I’m close enough to Iris that we call each other by first names. Do you really wish to tear the man Iris admires so much away from her? Is that what Iris wants? Letting me go now would in turn earn you respect from the Dustiness family and Iris. In other words, all this links intricately to the brightness of your future, Rain.
Don’t listen, Rain! You might look slightly better to the Dustiness family, but it’ll leave a gaping gash in my image of you! Nothing good ever happens to my enemies! Besides, in the name of Princess Iris’ future, we have to separate this man no matter how much Iris idolizes him! You know this very well, with this man around, Iris‑sama will only become increasingly scummy! Just look at how Iris‑sama’ been acting lately!
Say, Rain, think carefully. Couldn’t I, who have extensive experience with defeating demon generals and bounty criminals, become great help for the armed forces? Haven’t you witnessed the extent of my abilities in this short moment? I’d be Iris’ playmate, and I can also help defend the castle as needed. Not gonna lie, I’m highly skilled at finding the enemy’s weakness… How does it sound? There aren’t any negatives to this, are there? With a playmate, Iris would be joyful. I’d live here happily. The country would also benefit from having a strong adventurer at service. Finally, you, Rain, would gain positive views from Iris and the Dustiness family. Isn’t that right? Don’t you like such a win-win scenario?
Rain, don’t fall into silence! I beg you, don’t just agree with a ‘so that’s how things are, no problem!’ …I-I get it, Rain, I recall your family having some unpaid debt, right? How about letting my family pay for you? Wasn’t it about several tens of millions? How does that sound, not bad, right!?
Listen here, Rain; my net worth surpasses a billion. You know how…
G-get him! Don’t let him say any more!
D-damn despicable scum! I was in the midst of negotiation, you can’t just interrupt! Hey Claire, do you not cherish your panties!? A while ago you mentioned how nothing good ever happens to your enemies, but I assure you that being my enemy isn’t any better!
I know, I know, Kazuma‑dono! Truthfully, I think you’re more terrifying than any monster! Not only combat wise, but you also have superior charisma and expansive connections. I already knew you were rich, but since then you have progressed unimaginably well…!
Rain, I presume you had brought the memory wiping potion as I told you?
I didn’t initially want to resort to such drastic measures, but letting you stay with Princess Iris creates a real risk for negative influence. Besides, being subjected to as extreme a measure as repatriation would undoubtedly leave you hateful impressions of us. Honestly, I truly fear what you might do out of vengeance. So, while we sincerely apologize, we must ask that you forget everything that happened after the night when Lady Dustiness invited you to return to Axel. Indeed, that’s when you read the children’s letters… Proceed, Rain!
I-I understand. Should we really use this? The potion was banned for having side effects as severe as causing dementia for the unlucky, after all… A-are you sure it’s fine?
S-stop it! Don’t feed me strange stuff like that! Remember, you’re lucky that it’s daytime, for only at night could I unleash my full potential. Night-vision with Detect Enemy and Sneak means I can infiltrate any stronghold; using a bow, I could also snipe you from any distance! You’ll do well to remember that! Remember!
H-hurry up! Make him drink the potion already, Rain! He’s terrifying! This man is scary as hell! That wasn’t even his final form! Just think, he didn’t even use the vicious freezing magic that choked Mitsurugi‑dono; he’s been merciful to us! Rain, quick! Completely erase all his memories from today now!
I’ve also been a bodyguard for quite some time, but this is also the first time I’ve seen someone so terrifying—! Q-quick, drink the potion…! Kazuma‑dono, open your mouth please…!
Tinder!
Hot! It burns! Ahhh, it burned a hole in my favourite expensive cape!
This man, still resisting under this circumstance…! I’m absolutely horrified of you, Kazuma‑dono! Rain, I’ll buy you a new cape later, please start chanting the teleportation spell! I’ll deal with the potion!
Onii‑chan!
Claire, what the hell are you trying to do to my aniki!? I’m angry AF right now! Cut the crap or else I’ll really hold a grudge, from the bottom of my heart!
Princess Iris, please don’t use terms like aniki or ‘AF’ anymore! I’ve already prepared to face your inevitable wrath. Right now, I’m making this man drink the memory wiping potion and repatriating him to Axel!
That’s unforgivable AF!
It’ll be my turn to get angry AF if Iris‑sama doesn’t stop using that language!
Even Claire‑sama got infected! The teleportation chant is finished, commence repatriation at will!
Onii‑sama!
Onii‑sama, if chance brings us together again, I’ll never leave you behind!
Iris, onii‑san will return! I promise I won’t leave the castle next time; I’ll live here in leisure everyday—!
What the hell is this man saying under this circumstance!? Now, swallow! Rain, teleport him as soon as he drinks the potion!
Write me letters when you remember me! Onii‑sama, I’ll be waiting for you! I believe you’ll someday defeat the Demon King for sure—!
…?
Huh, my wallet’s gone? Crap, did I lose it somewhere? I don’t remember running much, I must’ve left it somewhere.
S-still not back…! What are those people doing!? Should I go check the Adventurer’s Guild? No, it’d be terrible if I missed them on the way. Plus, going to the guild after waiting adamantly for so long gives me a sense of defeat…
You look bigger than I remember.
Dragon thief!
Who are you calling a thief? It’s about time you accepted that it’s only a chick. Why not open the door when you’re home? Making me wait thinking that nobody was inside.
I’m not quite sure what you’re talking about. After talking with Megumin and Darkness, we decided this mansion belongs to the beautiful goddess Aqua‑sama. Darkness has her own mansion in this city, Megumin has her home over at the Crimson Demon village, so the house ended up in my hands. That’s how this mansion became my property. Weren’t you going to live in the castle? Get out! Get out of my yard now!
I know you’re usually stupid, but today you’re plain ridiculous. Look at you, what happened to your brain? How about using a little healing magic on your head? If that doesn’t work, I’ll send you to the hospital right away.
I’m home! Darkness, Megumin, open the door if you’re home! That idiot Aqua locked me out!
If it’s not for the great Kazuma striding leisurely here to see us. Had a great week at the capital?
Hahaha, we really are nothing to you…! Being a poser aside,  you dare get us to return early then stay alone at the capital… ! Is there a limit to how much of a scumbag you can be!? I never thought you would have the audacity to do that when the mood was so encouraging !
Hey, hold on. What’s that about me staying a week at the capital after you guys returned? What is that supposed to mean? I stayed for another night at most, how did it turn into… huh?
Hey, you’ve got some nerve playing dumb. Wanna see how far my explosion magic can propel someone!?
…Kazuma, what did you stir up at the capital? You’re likely drugged by the forbidden memory wiping potion that’s seldom used even by the royals. That potion erases memory proportionally with dosage, with a side effect of causing dementia if you’re unfortunate; although, it seems we have nothing to worry about in that department.
To me, this guy is already spewing demented lines… Although, memory wiping potion, you say? …Sure enough, Kazuma’s attitude has been strange just then… He couldn’t be faking memory loss to avoid commotion, could he? …However, in case he really did lose his memory, it feels wrong to keep judging him in this state…
My memory goes as far as bidding farewell. I remember being called to Iris’ bedroom, then…
Hey, while I can’t be certain, given my tendency to get dragged into grave matters by chance, in all likelihood I must have stumbled upon some important national secret. Then, the royal court probably spent many days deliberating the proper treatment for someone as important as me. During that time, I’m guessing they would have sent half-assed letters under my name to keep you from worrying about my extended stay… Finally, they realized they’d be worse off without me, so they ended up letting me off after wiping my memory. How does this theory sound?
Hmm… It’s possible…? Besides, I can’t really think of another reason for them to use the memory wiping potion in particular…
Wh-who knows? My instinct tells me that this man may have stayed merely out of his inability to withstand Iris’ cuteness… Although, that wouldn’t explain why his memory was wiped. Hmm…
Wasn’t there someone called Claire in the capital? I always had a feeling that she’s the source of all evil. I had gotten along with her quite well thanks to Iris, yet I have an inexplicable hatred and sense of vengeance towards that bitch.
…Indeed. The head of the Symphonia family does indeed have rights to use the memory potion. Besides, she’s an important figure in the kingdom’s government. I do also remember you being great pals with Claire‑sama… Hmm, this makes the hypothesis even more believable.
Forget it, having you back safely is good enough. Although, since you haven’t been accompanying me for my explosion walks, you’ll have to start tomorrow as punishment.
What are you two talking about? Busy being stupid? How braindead do you have to be to believe this shameless, vile NEET? Mark my words, I bet this loliNEET conveniently stayed after hearing something like ‘onii-chan daisuki’ from that Iris. Since life surrounded by maids and butlers is so heavenly, he thought he might as well live his carefree life at the capital and not give a damn about us anymore. It must be true!
Hey, don’t be so pessimistic. How could that kind of thing hap…pen…… Huh?
See that? For now, you are forbidden from entering the mansion. If you really wish to enter, prostrate before me and say, “I’m sorry Aqua‑sama.
What kind of joke is that!? Wait!
Huh, what’s this?
900 Eris in total.
Here’s 100 Eris of change. Thank you for visiting, come again soon!
Oho, long time no see, the gigolo who had just enjoyed a succulent meal paid by the girl who fancies him. Nice to see thee on a walk tonight. The full moon filleth the air with magical power, making the perfect environment for walks! After a walk, I plan to climb atop an Axis church and replace their symbol with this particularly erotic radish. Mindst thou coming along?
…I’d rather not. Careful not to get torn to shreds when they find out.
Say, Vanir, you’re free right now, aren’t you? Could you help me?
Ohh? To ask that, thou must know of the trade-offs in dealing with a devil, dost thou not? I only offer assistance at a price. As a powerful devil, I expect a hefty payback in return. Dost thou understand?
Next time I head to Wiz’s, I’ll mass purchase all the garbage and overpay.
Praise this customer! Thou canst count on me! …Wouldst thou also have this radish as a bonus?
I’ll pass.
Muahahaha! Muahahahahahaha!
Hey, don’t laugh at such a time! What made you so hyped tonight!?
Muahahahaha! I am unnaturally hyped tonight! Striking a goddess under the full moon; how could I possibly calm myself?
…Eh?
Vanir, could you use your foresight on me real quick? See whether Megumin’s or Darkness’ room is a better choice.
Ohh? A pungent aura still lingering around you blinds my vision a little. Although…from what I could tell, infiltrating either room yields the same result; however, choosing the Crimson Beggar girl’s room is better overall. Thou shalt enjoy a little bonus there. Go ahead.
Megumin’s window it is. Okay, I’m off!
…Huff…huff…!
Room check! Megumin, are you awake as told? I have a feeling that man will likely try to infiltrate Megumin or Darkness’ bedroom right about now! You guys may feel sleepy these days, but try to adapt alright?
I’m awake, Aqua. It’s all fine, no problems here. Why don’t you take a rest too, Aqua? Besides, a slight infiltration couldn’t be that bad; after all, Kazuma seems to have had his memory wiped, shouldn’t we go easier on him…?
No way in hell, Megumin! Zero tolerance for that dirty hikikomori! I get it now, Megumin must be the type that would walk a thousand miles for the man she loves even though he’s total garbage! And no matter how many times he screws us over, you’d always forgive him out of affection—that’s what my all-seeing eyes are telling me!
W-w-w-what are you talking about!? I-it’s nothing like that…!
Megumin, Megumin, you couldn’t possibly be…
What!? Possibly be what!?
Megumin… You! That Dust thug, could you possibly be…!
Not at all.
Muahahaha! Muahahahaha! Come out, come out and fight, toilet goddess! Tonight, the moon is waxed, a priceless moment for the great I whose magic power is at its absolute peak! As a duke of hell, I’m here to send thee back to whence thou came’st!
Now, Kazuma! Aqua’s storming to the front door, quick, grab my hand!
You’ve finally shown your true self, you mentally defective devil! Right back at you; I’ll send you whence you came first!
Bring it on, bring it on! I’d like to see thee try! Take this, Vanir-style—!
Haa…Haa…!
Haa…Haa…! Megumin…Megu…Megumin…Haa-aaah…!
Wait…! K-Kazuma, your breathing! Your breathing sounds so wrong! The mere scene of us hugging as you’re gasping and repeatedly moaning my name just looks terribly wrong!
Aqua, what’s all this fuss about… Vanir, what do you want from us at such an hour!? Everyone’s been irate lately, now with you here…!
What do you meaaaaaaannnn—!
Well done, Darkness! Keep holding him down! Sacred Exorcism!
Gahhhhhh!? No, that’s impossible! I…I have been defeated…even under the empowerment of the full moon, at my absolute peak…!
W-we did it…!
Ahahahahaha! Didst thou think thou hast won? Unfortunately, what thou hast killed was only an erotic radish! Thou canst have it as a participation award.
Oho, please refrain from pursuing in silence! After much wait, I’ve finally tasted such delicious negative emotions! Having accomplished my goal, I shall call it here. So long!
Darkness, flank him from behind! Take him out! Tonight, we’ll remove this clown that trolls for a living, once and for all!
A-Aqua, what should we do with the sexy radish…!?
Welcome home. Although life in the capital was great, only everyday conflicts and arguments like this can breathe life into the mansion. Please don’t leave us on your own accord again, alright?
Hey, Megumin, I’m not going anywhere. I’m already home, so isn’t it time to let me loose?
Had you let the much stronger Darkness pull you up, I think your entry would’ve been much easier. Despite that, you specifically came to my room; so,  
bonus
Hurry up and make up with Aqua, alright? She kept saying everyday ‘is that wanton NEET still not home? Still not home!?’ While you were away, she always seemed bored, a bit lonely, even.
She also prepared dinner for Kazuma every night, calling it ‘the portion for the wanton NEET who’s still out-and-about’. In the end, she force-fed Darkness the extra food.
…Let me go tie up the loose ends with that idiot. We’ll continue once I get back.
N-not continuing, definitely not!
Go on now!
—Ahh! Burglar! Darkness, a burglar just broke into the beautiful goddess’ mansion! Go catch him!
beautiful goddess
…Hey, Aqua, isn’t it about time that you made up with Kazuma… Owieowieowie! Cut it out, Aqua, don’t pull my hair!
Darkness, do you really enjoy being abandoned by this NEET so much? When you received letters saying that he wanted to live with Iris, you breathed heavily and complained about being cucked. If we all keep spoiling Kazuma, there’d truly be no saving this despicable man! Hell, I think he’s far beyond saving already!
Hey, not that I want to pick a fight, but I must make myself clear. I never betrayed you guys. Think about it, am I that superficial of a man? Did you think I would ditch my dear companions for Iris? I’m neither trashy nor lolicon-y enough to do that. While Iris is precious to me; at the end of the day, she’s still my sister. Do you honestly believe I’d make moves on girls that age?
Thou, as the useless trash whose only abilities in the previous life were rock-paper-scissors and gaming, should reflect on howthoudied in the first place. Remember whomthouwere trying to protect before entering this world. Had the person in question been a senior,thouprobably wouldn’t have batted an eye. Set aside that surficial dignity and tell us thy true self: My name is Satou Kazuma, and I amtheloliNEET!
Since when did saving a high school girl make one a lolicon!? Don’t you get all cocky for conquering my home, either; tonight, I’ll teach you a lesson!
Darkness, protect me! Come shield me against this dangerous intruder!
Hey, what!? Wait a minute…!
Watch as I Drain Touch all your stamina, Bind you up then throw you into Emperor Zell’s pen! Repent!
Come at me then, you damn NEET! Do you really believe an undead skill can hinder me!? Mind you, this is a 2v1, so don’t expect to win!
W-wait, I never agreed to fight Kazuma…!
—I-impossible…!
God’s Blow
God’s Requiem
Huff…huff…! You…you were a tough one huh, Kazuma? But still, since the victor is clear, come on! Apologize to me! Just say sorry and I’ll forgive you!
…I did nothing wrong this time. Forget trying to satisfy Iris’ final wish, even my memory’s gone; therefore, I have no reason to apologize! Do you not realize that I have one last trick up my sleeve? Mark my words: tomorrow, you’ll be begging for my forgiveness in tears!
Haw, fighting to your last breath, huh? I was about to call this a wrap here, but you seem to want more. No problem! You have your schemes, and I have my measures. Kazuma, I hereby swear as the Goddess of Water to never let a step inside this house without an apology! You are now banished! I can already see you crying while saying sorry tomorrow!
Kazuma‑san!  !
Waaaaah! K-Kazuma‑san! Master Kazuma!!
should be forgiven due to being female
Kazuma‑sama! I’ve…always thought that Kazuma‑sama was in fact a very—well, a generally amiable man! Plus, from all the time we’ve spent together, you should know that mutual understanding is the key to solving conflicts…!
Officer, it’s her.
After surveying the real estate office, we’ve confirmed your ownership of this property, Satou Kazuma‑san. Next, we shall proceed to reclaim your illegally occupied housing.
Kazuma‑san! Master Kazuma! Waaaaaaaah! Kazuma‑samaaaaa!
I-I-I-I’m um, Kazuma’s housemate, so…!
Is that true? It’d be big news indeed if the Lady of House Dustiness turned out to be a criminal.
Waaaaaaah! Kazuma‑sama! Kazuma‑sama! Please forgive me, Kazuma‑sama! I’m sorry, it’s all my fault! please forgive me Kazuma‑sama! Are my apologies not enough Kazuma‑sama!??
Good morning, Goddess of Water. Are you sure you’re not going to let me back in before I’ve said sorry?
I’m sorry, Kazuma‑sama! I’ll be obedient from now on! I won’t ever doubt you again! Please forgive me!
AHHH, WHERE WOULD YOU ALL BE WITHOUT ME!?
Kazuma‑sama, your tea’s ready.
Thank you.
You useless maid! The hell was that!? Wasn’t that pure water!? How many times do I have to tell you: don’t even slightly touch the tea otherwise it’ll turn to water, so be careful! Remake it! Right now! Go re-brew my tea!
Ahhh, my sincere apologies, Kazuma‑sama! Your tea will be remade shortly!
The problem appears to be solved. To be truthful, I’m just happy that everyone can all sit together in this living room once more.
All aside, it’s all good as long as you’re here in one piece… And please don’t call the cops so rashly again…
Your tea’s here!
I appreciate it.
What did I say? This is pure freaking water! Couldn’t you use your brain for once!?
Ahh! I’m extremely sorry Kazuma‑sama! I, your servant, will go remake it right away…!
Aqua, if you mess up every time, just let me do it. That way, Kazuma won’t have to yell at you anymore. Then… I’ll be the only one he needs to yell at…
Hey Darkness! I’ve finally caught this rare chance to play the Dustiness Maid game, so step aside!
!?
Hey, so the real reason you kept purifying my tea on purpose was to imitate Darkness’ perverted maids?
Not exactly; I’ve always directly poured you hot water.
Hold on a second you two, there’s nothing wrong with the maids of my family!
Kazuma‑sama, to punish this useless Dustiness maid, please doodle all you want on my body!
Er…
As I said, our maids would never ask for something like that!
Ahh! Ouch ouch ouch…
That must be an injury from last night. So sorry, Kazuma‑sama! Well, today, I’ll go out of my way and use the most powerful healing spell in existence.
Sacred Highness Heal!
…………Ahh.
What is it?
What’s wrong Kazuma‑sama? That was the strongest healing magic I know of, was it not enough?
Err…Ah, no. It was great. Th-thanks a lot, Aqua. Now I feel much more relaxed. And by the way, since we’re mates, stop calling me ‘Kazuma‑sama’, just ‘Kazuma’ is fine; otherwise, I’d feel isolated.
…What happened to you? Nonetheless, that was an admirable thought after having said ‘since Aqua suspected you for a week, she shall call you by ‑sama for another week’. After all, you’re right about us getting closer as teammates.
…Wh-what is it?
…Nothing. I just promised to never suspect Kazuma again.
Scumzuma
Kazutrash
Aqua, remember this? It must’ve been from a week ago for you yet it feels brand new to me, who’s suffering from amnesia. Now, let’s see the passion you felt! Think about the real cause we’re here for!
Anyways! Let’s head to the Adventurer’s Guild! We’ll take quests—for the safety of Axel, and the world!
morning
Morning. What’s for breakfast? I won’t be wanting miso soup for a long while after eating weird things everyday in the capital.
Didn’t you get your memories back? You do remember what the children wrote to you, right? Waking up this late isn’t the way to be. Forget breakfast, we’re having lunch soon. It’ll be lobsters, because when I had Megumin’s secret Crimson Demon lobster dish in Elroad, I was captivated. This time, I’ve finally convinced her to prepare the raw ingredients after numerous attempts.
W-well then. Megumin’s dish is indeed quite delicious. Anyways, what are we doing today? …Are we really going to the guild?
I really like onii-chan.
Whatever you like. In Kazuma’s absence, we’ve calmed down a bit… So, if Kazuma is absolutely determined to take quests, I’m all for it.
Don’t mind me. Ask if Aqua is absolutely determined to go.
Didn’t you two gain any motivation from the letters? Hey, Kazuma, you’re no less than an admired idol for those children! Aren’t you going to be a role model for them?
I can understand why they admire me, but after calming down… Well, you know the rest. Think again carefully. Since experience can be earned by merely eating special cuisine, there’s no need to do dangerous adventuring.
this guy is hopeless
Hey Aqua, you get along with children too, right? Don’t you often play with kids in the neighbourhood? Don’t you also call yourself a goddess, like you did at the capital? Then, shouldn’t defeating the Demon King be your duty?
I am indeed the Goddess of Water, Aqua-sama… Although it’s strange considering how you guys don’t usually believe that at all. Hey, are you all realizing my godhood from heart? Then, since I’ve lived with you for so long, I must be more important than that Eris, right? Why not switch to the Axis cult?
…B-but, every generation of my family had been loyal defenders of the nation and its religion. My duty prevents me from believing any cult other than Eris cult…
Liar! You still don’t believe me! Darkness, I really am the Goddess of Water! Don’t you ever wonder how a normal person could stay submerged for so long and turn any solution to water with a touch!?
A-about that… I heard that Axis priests are very powerful due to the devotion of their followers, so I wouldn’t be surprised if they could turn whatever they touch to water; besides, Axis cultists probably don’t even need to breathe…
Apologize, now! Apologize for making my children sound like monsters! On another note… Everything Darkness wrote in those letters were compliments for Kazuma. I believe it’s about time to redeem the name of the Axis cultists; more specifically, I also want fan mail!
…Hey, you were saying…?
Go where again exactly? …Oi, Darkness, the letters you showed me earlier were supposed to be from children, Right?
That’s indeed how it happened! Problem!? I even paid the kids to write them! Did you think I had a choice!? You wouldn’t come home any other way!
Way to blame the victim! I even treasured my first fan mail as a memento!
W-were you that elated by them? I sincerely apologize for that…
Back then you were still an honorable woman who refused to abuse her status. Since when did you learn scams like this!? You have been trigger-happy with abusing power lately, threatening this and seducing that. And now you…!
W-well, whose fault do you think it is!? That’s right, it’s all you! I’ve only fallen this low because of you!
Why the hell am I the scapegoat!? Who are you kidding, bitch!? Your character doesn’t seem at all that different from when we had met!
Apologize, now! Those letters really touched me! Not only to Kazuma, you owe me an apology, too!
Quiet down everyone, eat the food before it gets cold. I spent a lot of effort in this.
Oi, Kazuma, we’re not finished yet!
Shut up, you deceptive woman! Go eat your crayfish!
What are crayfish?
H-hello!
 Meagerm—! I mean, M-Megumin-san, is she home?
Only the finest tea for our respected guests.
M-many thanks!
Thank you very much!
So, what brought Punyfura and Dodumko here with my sister in tow?
How about you get our names straight first! I’m Funifura, Fu-ni-fu-ra!
I’m not Dodumko but Dodonko! Could you be holding a grudge just because I nearly called you Meagermin!? I merely bit my tongue!
Anyway, these are Funifura and Dodonko, two insignificant Crimson Demons. Just keep them in mind for the time being.
How could you!? How could you use terms like ‘insignificant’ and ‘the time being’!?
While we’re indeed usually treated as a pair and aren’t that important, I still can’t tolerate being judged by Megumin!
Here, have a taste of this, too! Don’t worry, we still have a lot; take your time.
Komekko, there’s dessert afterwards…s-so, please don’t be so aggressive, you’re worrying me.
Long time no see, Megumin. Your sister suffered tragic events, so we brought her here.
Yes yes, we’re unsure if it applies only to your sister or your whole family…but needless to say, Komekko has encountered a disaster and has nowhere to seek refuge. We then heard that Megumin and Yunyun are both in Axel, so we’ve escorted her all the way here.
What matter could be so grave? What happened to Megumin’s home? By the way, we’ve talked before when I visited the crimson demon village, right?
Aren’t you Megumin’s boyfriend? Er, do you live with her? Actually, forget your home, the whole village has been hit by a disaster.
Yes yes, it’s nonetheless a bit difficult to express…
A ’boom’ and my home was gone.
What did you mean by ‘boom’? Please elaborate!
The army of the Demon King’s daughter is invading the Crimson Demon village.
The Demon King’s daughter… Does that mean the village’s secret has finally been exposed?
Kazuma, don’t worry too much. It’s fine. Many Crimson Demons know teleportation, we won’t be dealt with so easily. Even if the whole village burns down, we can still magically repair it in a jiffy.
No, while I am quite worried for Megumin’s parents, I’m mainly interested in the secret of Crimson Demons. Don’t you have the tendency to collect…uhm, ‘evil goddesses that had been sealed away’ and other dangerous things to your own village? You also tend of have some sort of doomsday device in store. So, I was wondering if that’s the reason the Demon King’s daughter is attacking you.
I understand. It seems necessary to tell Kazuma the truth now.
Actually, one of the tourist attractions at the Crimson Demon village is a watchtower that can spy on the Demon King’s castle.
Indeed, there is a watchtower upgraded with powerful magic items on a mountaintop near the village. Although it hasn’t reached the stage of ‘Omniscience’ yet…
Us Crimson Demons can observe the Demon King’s castle anytime. His daughter seems to have found out…
The original selling point for that thing was that it ‘could see into the Demon King’s daughter’s bedroom’. But now that our victim knows about it…
Mhm, the Demon Army’s information warfare capabilities are not to be underestimated.
What did you just say?
As they have said, the watchtower can not only generate revenue from tourism but also provide entertainment for NEETs in the village. A piece of equipment this valuable…
…would obviously be attacked by the Demon King’s daughter. Hey, I’ve always wanted to ask: why is the Demon King at war with humans? To be brutally honest, aren’t you Crimson Demons and the Axis cultists the main reason we’re still fighting?
Oi, are you girls feeling guilty?
Wh-what do you mean, Kazuma? Why are we always to blame…? We just have the Crimson Demon barbeque festival every four years…
Barbeque?
All teleportation-capable Crimson Demons would gather quadrennially and have a barbeque near the Demon King’s castle. After the feast, us Crimson Demons then unleash a whole mess of magic upon the barrier, only returning after the Demon Army comes charging out.
You guys are sincerely annoying. Can we stop with these troublesome activities already!? …Nevertheless, I understand the situation now. Thank you for bringing Komekko over, we’ll keep her refuge; alright?
Since the child doesn’t really have another home, we sincerely thank you. We ourselves have duties to attend to…
Mhm, as the Crimson Demons, how could we refuse free meals delivered to our doorstep?
Daughter of the Demon King, show yourself! I call dibs on the first strike with my explosion! Funifura, Dodonko, let’s move!
How could you even help? Next, we’re going to meet up with the other Crimson Demons and engage in guerilla warfare with the Demon King’s daughter, now that she’s occupied our village. With only explosion magic, you’re at most a backup.
backup
Yes yes, we were recruited as soon as we learned advanced magic. Feel free to watch in jealousy as we put on a show.
Ah, speaking of which, Yunyun should be in this city too, right? Do you know where she is? She’s also invited, although we haven’t been able to find her.
Mhm, and I remember Yunyun describing in her letters what the friends she made here looked like. Even though we told her in advance that we’d be coming today…
friends
—L-look, Megumin, we wanted to ask you something.
Yunyun wrote in her letters that she had made a guy friend in Axel… She’s really exaggerating and has no friends in reality, right?
I-is that true? Yunyun possibly has more friends besides us! Forget Megumin, please don’t tell me that even Yunyun has more friends than we do…
As for her male acquaintances, first we have Kazuma over here, plus…the chick-magnet Vanir down the street and the notoriously degenerate blonde delinquent adventurer Dust…
Ha…Haha! L-look, she’s already trying her best given her abilities! Unlike the Crimson Demon village, there’re many people here! So, having one or two weirdos befriend her is nothing unexpected!
E-exactly! By the way, Megumin, what’s up with this guy here? You talked a lot about him back in the village; but on a second thought, it didn’t make much sense. No way Megumin can possibly be this lovey-dovey. Be honest with us, Megumin. The shared bathing, sleeping together and events of the sort are all accidents, right?
Uhmm… How should I put this… Er…
You…hey, you gotta be joking, right!? How could you possibly react so girlishly…!
N-no, I can’t lose to even Megumin… How could I lose to that chronically airheaded Megumin who’s the least likely to touch romance…!
Please keep this secret from my parents.
AHHHHH! We’ll never…!
…lose to you!
So, I’ll share my bed with Komekko. It’s been a while, you must have felt lonely. Here, let me compensate you with some long-awaited bedtime companionship.
Onee-chan must have been lonely without me…
K-Komekko!
Looks tasty…
Komekko, we have an abundance of food here, so please leave Emperor Zell and Chomusuke alone!
You’re right, we must wait till they grow fatter.
No, that’s not why, Komekko! Those are our pets!
Since we rarely gather, let’s host a welcome party. Onii-san will bring you all sorts of delicacies!
Onii-san is so handsome!
What are you writing?
mm/dd/yyyy: successfully seduced onee-chan’s boyfriend. I seem to have shifted his target from onee-chan to myself… Komekko! What do you mean by ‘seduce’ and ‘boyfriend’, who taught you these words!?
Buzucoily.
That damn hikikomori huh!? The NEET really has zero redeeming factors!
Say, what is this, really? A diary?
Mom told me to use this to keep track of onee-chan’s relationship with her boyfriend.
Onee-chan, another one!
Komekko, we always have enough food here, so you can stop stuffing yourself like there’s no tomorrow.
Oi, Darkness, why is the rice somewhat salty…?
Hmm… because I’ve been crying buckets…
Because she rarely has the chance to fill her stomach!
That may be the case, but as your older sister, I’d feel ashamed. Here, have some pudding for dessert.
Nom!
food awareness
Onee-san is full, you can have my pudding, all right?
Is that really okay? Wasn’t pudding a super precious snack we only eat on birthdays? Don’t you want it?
Komekko, we’re the most famous adventuring party in the whole nation; no worries for money. Tomorrow I’ll make you a whole tub of pudding. For today, just say thanks and eat all these.
Thanks everyone!
Huh, you’re up? Are you here for breakfast?
Oh please… Megumin, go ahead and tell me when you need money. You always let me handle most of the income, only taking some change and tax money every month. How about I allocate a portion specifically for your personal spending?
Thanks for your consideration, but I’m fine. I only send a portion of my savings to my parents every month. Speaking of which, should I send too much money home, my dad would definitely blow through it all making useless magic items.
I didn’t know your daddy was that irresponsible.
Onee-chan onee-chan, your boyfriend is finally here. Can we go to the guild now?
Komekko…! K-Komekko, uh… Could you stop calling him ‘onee-chan’s boyfriend’!?
Right, so Komekko wants to visit the guild? Since you’re interested, why not let this famous onee-san take you there?
That’s right, I had returned here to start from zero, to keep doing quests. Taking Komekko along while we look for suitable quests isn’t a bad idea. By the way, why would you want to go there anyway? That’s no place for fooling around.
I want to visit the guild to see how strong onee-chan is.
In her recent letters, onee-chan told me that she is well-respected within the guild. People would often compliment her and bow down at the mere sight of her.
Oi.
Komekko, why don’t we go play in the yard? You can meet Emperor Zell in the pen there. Besides, it must’ve been long since you last played with Chomusuke, right? So, take her with you and go feed Emperor Zell!
Understood! I’ll feed it till it’s super fat!
…Oi.
It’s not what it looks like.
Let me explain; this matter has deep history… That’s right, it dates back to when I first left the Crimson Demon village…
—Nothing earth-shattering to speak of, is there?
I wish I had another way. Should my parents become too worried, they might come take me back—that’d be terrible news. Plus, without me, wouldn’t Kazuma also be distraught?
what do you have to say now?
No, uh…… Eh? If Megumin gets taken away…?
Oi.
I’d very much be distraught if Megumin left! Because that way, I’d have to remake the chore distribution charts and do even more work! On top of that, I’d have one less friend to play with!
L-let’s put that aside for now. You’d better tell Komekko the truth first. Since you can’t hide it forever, confessing sooner rather than later could save you a lot of trouble.
B-but my pride as an older sister…! No, Darkness is right. Originally, I only wanted to lie about my conditions to keep my parents calm—at first, I wrote the letters sincerely, but my mother was still too overprotective… After all, since we live in a mansion now, boasting about being a frontline hero is redundant. There’s no reason to take me home either at this point. I’d better come clean with Komekko.
—Komekko… I have some serious matters to discuss with you.
Could the tub of pudding onee-chan promised to give me…be a ruse?
It’s nothing insignificant like that, the pudding isn’t a trick! I’m here to tell you something far more important!
Komekko,
You remember how I claimed in my letters that we were the strongest party in Axel, right?
Mhm, that onee-chan is a super-duper mage that can kill any monster in a single hit and she’s well-respected by other adventurers because of it…
Right. About that…
And the blonde onee-san never backs down before any monster, she’s a reliable crusader who can withstand any attack. The blue-haired onee-san is a priest that never loses to any undead or devils; she can even revive dead people like a goddess.
Onee-chan’s boyfriend is a very lucky and smart man; he killed many strong enemies. Even though he often complains, he still stands up for his friends when they’re in danger. Very gentle.
Komekko, you didn’t have to say everything! The truth behind these descriptions…
As expected of Megumin, at least acknowledging that I’m like a goddess—even though I am one. It’s fine Komekko, your sister ain’t lying.
Er, hmm. While I’m surprised at how Megumin sees me, those aren’t really lies. Hehe… A reliable…crusader, huh…
Wh-what happened to you two!? D-don’t get the wrong idea, Komekko, what I wrote in the letters were all…!
…Completely true.
You guys just had to mess up this matter even more. I was already prepared to be despised by her when I confessed…
Relax, you. I really don’t think what you had told Komekko was that inaccurate. While it was indeed exaggerated, they were true for the most part.
That’s right, they were exaggerated just a tiny bit. Besides, many things can’t be explained clearly in letters, so those mistakes aren’t even your fault.
Blonde onee-san, are you really super strong? Sturdy enough to withstand explosion magic? Too powerful for even devils to possess?
Mhmm, those are indeed true. Hmm, er… Man, did Megumin include even these details…? Needless to say, they’re still true.
So great!
So, what about me? Why not talk about me a little?
I have something to say!
Everyone, listen, we actually have a request for you all!
So, you just have to cooperate. We aren’t sure about the reward yet, but at least for the time Megumin’s sister is around, I’ll pay for all your drinks.
I know what I’m asking is stupid, but…you have my sincerest gratitude should you accept.
K-Kazuma…!
You didn’t have to go this far for me. I should better tell Komekko the truth. Compared to keeping her onee-chan’s dignity, not troubling Kazuma is more important. Everyone, please forget what he just said. Sorry for dragging you all into this mess.
Don’t act like a stranger, Megumin. We got no problem with cooperating; after all, drinks are on Kazuma.
Speaking of which, Kazuma and company were the one who rescued me when I first came to this city. They bought me meals and taught me adventuring skills. Now, take it as a return of favors.
Indeed, Kazuma’s party defeated powerful Demon Generals multiple times. That’s no exaggeration. Speaking respectfully around Megumin? Piece of cake. After all, I had earned a hefty sum fighting strong monsters with you.
Uh… Thank you all very much. However, I still can’t fathom everyone lying for the sake of my petty dignity. So, while I understand your good intentions…
And here is the Axel Adventurer’s Guild! Sure, this might be a beginner’s town and everyone here are low-levelled, but it doesn’t lack in gentlemen who would eat and drink with you just for hanging around!
But onee-chan said that this city was filled with powerful adventurers!
She said they faced off against Demon General Beldia, the Mobile Fortress Destroyer and the Kowloon Hydra without faltering. They’re super courageous, and super handsome!
So great!
R-really? Perhaps. Adventurers from other cities would have abandoned post instantly. We may be strong, but your sister is much more powerful!
Mhm, even though we’re low-levelled, our passion for adventuring surpasses that of any city. But of course, we still are no match for Megumin-san!
So cool!
Hey!?
Megumin-san was being honest, lil’ girl. The adventurers of this city are all very brave; the ones like me had charged directly at that bastard Beldia’s face only to be slaughtered by him. Hehe, while it was for the good of the city. Granted, back then I could’ve used a little more finesse… Although, courage wise, I’m still no match for Megumin-san, who had faced off Beldia one-on-one.
When I first heard that the Mobile Fortress Destroyer, having laid waste to numerous nations, had come to Axel, I shuddered in fear. But then, I decided that I must protect the city that nurtured me for so long. Of course, that machine was also blown up by Megumin-san’s explosion magic. By the way, it was from that battle that I got this scar on my head…
I remember the fight with the Kowloon Hydra. It was a tough one… It was supposed to be a match for only the royal knights, yet because the capital had been busy dealing with the Demon Army, they couldn’t find time. Alas, we had to take care of it ourselves. Was I afraid, you might ask? Ha, I unfortunately don’t understand what fear is. And the hydra? He was terminated by none other than Megumin-san!
Onee-chan and everyone here are all so great!
Come, little one. Have a taste of Axel’s specialty, roast shrimps!
Idiot, little kids obviously love hamburgers way more! Here, try this shrimp hamburger!
I’ll take both!
—How terrifying. I’m truly worried about her future. It’d be a real problem once she starts exploiting men for her own benefits.
Being the older sister, you’re also pretty skilled at making waste out of men. See, on the rare occasion things get steamy, you would kill the mood…Owowowowow!
Excuse me…
A subjugation quest for Lucy the Spectre? Hmm, could that be…
durian quest
kimchi quest
Kazuma Kazuma, I have an ominous feeling. We’ll definitely end up being forced to take this hairy quest.
Coincidentally, Aqua, that is what I’m thinking, too.
You are Komekko, yes? I have ice cream for dessert here; could you listen to onee-san for a while in exchange?
Sure!
Yes, there was a priest called Lucy who had, due to circumstances, become a monster known as a spectre … To this day, she still spends her time in anxiety near the ruins of what used to be her church. Komekko, don’t you feel bad for spectre-san?
I do.
Komekko thinks so, too? But worry not, for our powerful adventurers will certainly finish the quest with little effort!
What!?
H-hey, Luna-san, what are you talking about…
You guys will finish it, right?
—Well then, let’s fly before we also get dragged in. Look at that onee-san’s brilliant smile. She must be incredibly happy that the unwanted quest has finally been answered.
We need a strong archpriest to let Lucy pass on; a lousy one who’s ignorant of faith and virtue, at that. Do those really exist?
We do have a plenty of trashy cultists, but the emphasis is on ‘powerful’. Most of the priests in this city stink of corruption and are barely skilled.
What about the Axis followers? They should be happy to send Lucy into the afterlife, right?
K-Kazuma Kazuma…
Hey, Aqua, this must sound puzzling coming from a crusader, but—do we really have to vanquish Lucy? To be honest, I’m not very convinced…
durian quests
What are you talking about, Darkness? You have heard of the reason she stays on this world, right? She’s a different case from a certain earth spirit in our house who is lonely and enjoys adventure stories. Should she pass on automatically after her soul’s been satisfied, it’d be no problem. However, Lucy will forever remain on this world. That way, I have the responsibility to force her into the afterlife.
While I know not of which unpopular god she worships, having fewer competitors is nevertheless better. I’ll let their final follower pass on and eliminate this reject god for good.
You good-for-nothing woman, give us back that feeling of slight compassion.
This has to be it, the church of the reject god! Who cares if she’s the Goddess of Vengeance and Manipulation, I’ll destroy her together with Lucy!
I’m inclined to agree with Darkness… Seeing that the endangered god is female only made me even more reluctant. After all, I can’t really bring myself to hate a spectre living in anxiety…
…Aqua, you were saying? Goddess of Manipulation and Vengeance?
Indeed. That’s what the receptionist lady told me. Lucy the spectre worships the Goddess of Manipulation and Vengeance; she still prays to this day.
Kazuma, could I say something?
What? Don’t tell me you want to let us have mercy on Lucy because the goddess of ‘manipulation and vengeance’ sounds too cool to be lost.
…N-no. While the goddess of ‘manipulation and vengeance’ does sound cool, she is more importantly related to me.
Oh you, this demon that goddess… Why do you always manage to involve yourself with such insidious entities. It’s annoying enough as it is with Aqua around.
Kazuma, remember when you went to the Crimson Demon village?
Mhm, I do. How could I forget such a unique place? Shared a bed with Megumin and got ♂pokedby Sylvia…
I’d rather you not remember sharing a bed! Besides that, I’m asking if you remember the attractions in the village.
Right. Stuff like the nekomimi shrine and the Excalibur rock. What about them?
There were also the ‘tomb which seals the evil god’ and the ‘sealing grounds of the nameless goddess’, right?
Mhm, I vaguely remember. Both seals were broken if I recall correctly. Sealed in the tomb was the Demon General known as Wolbach, and?
The seal of the evil god was accidentally broken when I was young, but at this point prosecuting me is senseless. Let’s set that aside that for now. The problem lies within the grounds of the sealed nameless goddess.
What do you mean by ‘senseless’? I think letting that evil god escape is poking a wasp’s nest and very significant.
…Yep, it dates to when I had first learned Explosion magic. To defeat an invading evil god’s subordinate, I chanted the explosion spell as I protected Komekko and Yunyun.
Oi, don’t you try to change the topic, look at my eyes while you talk.
Simply put, the target location of my explosion magic just so happened to be the sealing grounds. As a result, the Goddess of Manipulation and Vengeance that was trapped there escaped, and we haven’t seen her since.
What the hell are you saying? Hey, just what are you implying!?
The holy being that Lucy worships must be the goddess that had been sealed in the Crimson Demon village up until that point. By now, the goddess has been free for two years; she most likely has gained new followers besides Lucy. Therefore, don’t sweat making Lucy pass on, the goddess won’t vanish even then.
What the hell is wrong with you Crimson Demons? Bringing an evil god from elsewhere on your own accord just to seal her at your home, even making it an attraction. Aren’t your lives too lawless!? Consider at least a little how others feel!
Stop right there, Axis scum! Don’t come any closer!
What did you say, you damn ghost!? I feel that even using purification magic on you is a waste! Let me send you on your merry way with a God’s Beating!
Great Regina, Goddess of Manipulation and Vengeance, please bring divine retribution upon this blue-haired woman! You despicable Axis cultist, taste my curse!
You have the audacity to curse a pure goddess, don’t make me laugh! Darkness, give me your sword! Watch as I obliterate the hell out of the ruined church that this ghost calls home!
Calm down, you two. Aqua, we’re both disciples. Lucy, you must have been a disciple too, right? Then, let us stay calm and talk this out. The goddesses that you two worship wouldn’t want a fight, would they?
Oi, what do you mean by ‘the goddesses that you two worship’!? Didn’t you say that you recognize my godhood!? This spectre dare look down upon a goddess, don’t you think she should be destroyed as soon as possible!?
Regina-sama, who I faithfully worship, is the Goddess of Manipulation and Vengeance! We believe in the eye-for-an-eye ideal! So, an outsider like you can go mind your own business!
Man, that’s what I meant when I say Eris cultists are absurd! Eris has many followers, of course she has no need to fight! Although, acting arrogant to the bone just for being the national religion couldn’t possibly be beneficial.  Darkness, why not come pray for the Axis church once in awhile?
I’m so envious of the amount of followers Eris has! Unpopular religions like us must fight for survival everyday! Wanting peace? Don’t bring up such a first-world problem!
Look at you, just had to go meddle in other people’s business. Aqua would have purified her either way.
I’m also a devotee, so I’ve always wanted to convince a ghost into ascending on its own device…
Go repent! Go repent in the underworld for angering a goddess! Ahahahaha! Watch as I God’s Blow the reject goddess Regina along with her final follower into oblivion!
Grrr! The scent of a nemesis I’ve been smelling up till now… I didn’t believe that someone like you could be such a…!? Regina-sama, Regina-sama, I still have favors I’ve yet to return! Regina-sama who sent the man that wasted all my hard-earned money to hell! Regina-sama who robbed penniless the woman that married my brother only to scam him of all his wealth! I have to keep you from fading, at least in the name of all who’s unfortunate!
Don’t worry, the goddess that you praise was relieved of her seal two years ago. She must have garnered other followers by now.
…Really? How would you know about this?
Because I was the one who saved the goddess you worship. Go, you can rest in peace now.
Thank you so much, kind stranger… While I want to properly express my gratitude—it seems that the sole desire keeping me on this world has been satisfied—I couldn’t stay much longer. Sorry that I couldn’t return your favor…
The essence of us Crimson Demons is to never refuse gratitude. This is quite fitting to the eye-for-an-eye teaching of yours. We seem to click well with the Goddess of Manipulation and Vengeance, so you have no need to stress.
God’s Blow!
Ouch!
The hell are you doing all of the sudden! Why did you have to mess it up after finally reaching an understanding!? At this rate, she was in shape to naturally ascend!
Exactly because she was going to leave soon! I can’t stand being looked down upon by this questionable reject goddess and having her follower escape after defiling me!
No way you’re a goddess! It’s gods like you whose followers become outcasts! Don’t you feel ashamed of having less followers than your kouhai Eris-sama!? Your kouhai’s cult has become a national religion; meanwhile, the number of Axis cultists…pfft!
Oi, hold it you! I won’t accept being scolded this way by a reject cult with such few members that they might disappear any second!
Great Regina-sama… As the follower of the Goddess of Vengeance, in my final moments, I have unleashed an epic roast upon the goddess that lost to her own kouhai… Having finished acting badass, I shall be on my way now. I wish you a bright future…
WAAAAAAH! How could she run from this!
Oh Komekko, you got rice on your lips.
Onee-chan stole my food!
K-Komekko! Don’t make drama out of me eating your single grain of rice! Eat slower and steadier if you don’t want that to happen again. Your breakfast won’t grow legs and run away anytime soon.
When onee-chan used to steal corn from the farms, she said they would run away if we didn’t eat them fast enough.
Forget about that, cooked rice doesn’t run!
Being sisters seems pretty good. Ne, Kazuma, now I also want an imouto. There are gender-bending magic items in this world, you know; why not give it a try?
While I don’t get what exactly you’re implying, I understand your desire for imoutos. Imoutos are great, especially the cutesy ones that’d call you ‘onii-chan’—those are the best.
Emergency! Emergency! All adventurers, arm yourselves and gather at the guild. I repeat; all adventurers, arm yourselves and gather at the guild!
Urgent broadcasts should be rare around this time, right? We’re not in season for cabbages, there hasn’t been any high-bounty targets recently either. What’s going on?
Additionally, all Crimson Demons currently in the city must participate. I repeat, all Crimson Demons currently in the city must participate!
—What’s going on here? Oi, what just happened here?
If possible, I want to avoid doing anything dangerous; I just want to live in peace… But, since it was an emergency, I’m afraid there will for sure be another evil antagonist…
And what did you mean when you said all Crimson Demons must participate? Komekko is also a Crimson Demon; although she can’t use magic yet, we’ve still brought her along for the time being…
You’ve finally come!
…Eh? Why, all of the sudden? Unless the guild gave me VIP status after finally realizing the true usefulness and power of my explosion magic? A bit late in my opinion though…
No, not her. Actually, her attendance is optional. The more important subject is the other young lady.
Hey, what do you mean ‘optional’? Is that a challenge?
Welcome. We’ve prepared desserts, this way please!
Hey, don’t lead my sister around all willy-nilly! What’s going on? Since when did the Adventurer’s Guild turn into a lolicon club? Depending on your answer, I might call police right here and now!
Th-that’s not true! We have our reasons! Ah, Luna-san, what a great time for you to arrive!
Specifically calling for Crimson demons all of the sudden only to bait my sister as soon as we arrive, what is this supposed to be?
The Adventurer’s Guild is always on the search for excellent candidates. Reasonably, we’ll serve Crimson Demons who are born with the potential to become great mages. That said, isn’t it only logical that we show hospitality to Komekko-san?
Excuse me, all else aside, I’m also a Crimson Demon.
A-anyways, this way, Komekko-san! We’ve prepared an incredible amount of snacks!
No! I just said that I’m also a Crimson Demon…
Welcome, everyone! Sorry about the emergency broadcast!
So, I understand everyone’s been working hard yesterday. The success rate was very high, a rare occurrence since the Axel branch was established. Even the spectre Lucy had been subjugated by Aqua-san! As expected of Axel adventurers, you are all excellent!
Although…
We’ve prepared a new job for you exceptional people!
Compared to yesterday, the work today really is only slightly more arduous and difficult. It should definitely be no problem for the adventurers here!
Hold on, Luna-san, don’t be so inconsiderate.
Wait a second, what do you mean by ‘more difficult and arduous’ than yesterday’s quest!? Is this the reason behind the emergency rally!?
Forget it, just cut us some slack!
We gave our all yesterday, we’ve no strength left!
And I was planning to relax at the bar today…
There will be no problems, since the Axel adventurers here are the cream of the crop in the nation!
Right, Komekko-san?
Axel adventurers are super strong. Onee-san said it, they’re the type to never back off from any opponent, regardless of how powerful they are.
…Damn it! I-I’ll take it, all right!? Oi, bring it on! The hardest quest! Come at me!
Just w-watch, I’ll let you witness how powerful Axel mages are!
Everyone listen, you don’t have to be absurd…
Since they have defeated quite a few high-bounty targets with you, a number of them earned more money than they knew what to do with; consequently, laziness increased overall. Especially those who adventured with Kazuma; they’ve been NEET-ified thanks to you. For the sake of Axel’s security, I could see the necessity of this measure.
Anyways, let’s just take a few random quests. Gotta let Komekko witness our power, at least. Right, Megumin?
That’s right. Only Aqua got her chance to shine yesterday; if I want to keep my dignity, I’d better display my strength.
No worries. As a commission for Satou-san and his friends, we’ve specifically prepared a job aimed at strong parties.
Onee-san, onee-san, don’t you have a clear idea of our actual, raw power? Please have mercy on us. Flattering so much right now; what are you expecting from us? Even though you’re a beauty with a body that ticks all my criteria, I still won’t be led around like a dog on a leash.
Ah, haha, I’m a beauty huh… How flattering of Satou-san. What about this; should Satou-san successfully finish this commission…we can go on a date today after work.
Ah, I’ll pass on that. Onee-san’s anguish for being achristmas cakehas spread rather extensively among the adventurers.
Excuse me, but who has been spreading such information?
And thus, we bid you farewell. We’ll go hunt down some stray toads.
Not so fast, Satou-san. Putting the other quests aside for now, only this one requires you in particular. I can say with confidence that out of Axel, none other than you, Satou-san, can complete the quest I’m offering.
other quests aside for now, only this one
You really do rate me highly. It might sound weird coming from me; but frankly, I’m a real scumbag in face-to-face combat.
Of course I knew.
—Look, Kazuma, why don’t we forfeit this quest? The enemy is a tranquility princess. Do you know how she’s managed to stay rooted there for so long without getting destroyed?
Kazuma Kazuma, I actually don’t feel that motivated to destroy the tranquility princess…
You guys shouldn’t put all the blame on Kazuma. The tranquility princess is in fact a very benign existence to some people. For example, those who are tormented by terminal diseases can go to her and pass away peacefully—does that really count as evil? Although, also due to her existence, suicides have become rampant in that forest. Yes, that counts as suicide. As a servant of our Goddess, I frown upon suicide. Even if the subject has good intentions, I still cannot tolerate assisted suicide.
How could you still have not made up your minds. Do you really think I’d destroy the tranquility princess for wealth and fame?
Of course, aren’t you the man who would brutalize cute, innocent fairies for their experience and bounty? Last time, you assassinated the snow fairy that I caught and named; I still haven’t forgiven you yet!
I didn’t do anything, all right? It must have melted when you had placed it near the heater.
When we were at the Crimson Demon village, didn’t I tell you about my encounter with a tranquility girl? They aren’t at all charitable; in fact, they’re quite devious.
I’m still skeptical after all that happened. Since the opponent was so malevolent, how then could it go unnoticed by my all-seeing eyes?
Are you sure your eyes aren’t marbles?
Haw… Kazuma, that’s…
So, look closely, all; I’m telling you that I’m right.
Ne, Kazuma, isn’t that it? I see light over there.
Hello adventurers; have you come to seek a peaceful end, are you merely lost?
Or perhaps you have come to see…me?
Ne, so you’re the tranquility princess?
By ‘tranquility princess’, do you mean me? Since humans all have names, you’ve also given me a name; is that how it works?
Thank you. And please also offer my gratitude to the creators of my name for me, won’t you? After all, I couldn’t move in this form.
Ohh, your roots are intermingled with the earth, unlike the tranquility girl which had the form of a complete human.
Don’t!
Don’t touch my root. The roots are oblivious to my emotions and will harm you humans.
…What is it? You can pour out any hard feelings at me, you know?
what are you talking about after all that has happened
The tranquility girl you mentioned was devious, right? However, the tranquility princess is humane—or so they say, at least. Even the adventurers dispatched by Axel to destroy her all ended up unanimously agreeing. As for whether the tranquility princess should even be eliminated, that problem is hotly debated within the guild. They argue over whether she really is harmless, whether she should be considered an enemy at all and things like that.
That’s why they commissioned me. Speaking of which, onee-san did mention that this was a reconnaissance mission. As a seasoned professional who had seen through the trickeries of the tranquility girl, I’m always cautious; therefore, they’ve sent me in hopes of investigating the true intentions of this monster.
I’m not so sure that she really trusts you, but at least she acknowledges the fact you destroyed the tranquility girl without a second thought.
To pass away all by yourself in a secluded spot, or to spend your final moments hand-in-hand with a beautiful woman who truly understands your sorrows? They really had quite the debate over the better option.
I wanna ask, how did the recent visitors fare? How well did they take the ends of their lives?
Everyone’s faces looked peaceful post-death.
You seem different from the adventurers I’ve met up till now.
The very reason for my existence was to murder humans like you.
You appear to have an iron will… While it worries me, and fills me with guilt, to ask you this…
For the sake of my beloved humans…could you destroy me?
Don’t be that way; you should treasure your life as long as you’ve no diseases tormenting you, understand?Nothingis without useon this world. The only ones that deserve to be wiped out are the undead and unholy! There are cute and delicious monster, also kind ones like you! If even NEETs get to live happily, such a nice-hearted creature like you has no reason to stop living!
Indeed, you’re not in the wrong. Besides, for retired adventurers, tranquility girls are normally the only hope for a peaceful death. Compared to dying a treacherously lonely death, ending their lives painlessly under company is certainly better. On top of that, as the evolved form of tranquility girls, it’s by their own choice to let you bid them their final farewell. You have no responsibility to worry over.
C-can I…really keep on living on this world…?
Kazuma, about the uh, tranquility princess, I say…
Y-you’re…
Oi, don’t look at me that way, even I can be sensitive.
Ne ne Kazuma, what are you holding? Could it be that dingalingy thing from before? I know what it is.
K-Kazuma? Are you still skeptical? Even without things like that, we could…
please don’t tell me he’d go there
What is that?
Ah, this is a lie-detecting magic item, it rings when it hears a lie.
this guy really has the audacity
Makes sense. As a monster, I’m untrustworthy.
Look, Kazuma, right now I feel like you’re totally the paranoid and inadequate guy who suspects that his wife is committing adultery when she cheerfully announces her pregnancy even though he’s been saturating himself with other women on a regular basis.
You went too far, Aqua. However, I do agree that he is one crafty man who’s also despicably shrewd and chronically paranoid…
Thanks, you two. I’m fine; as a monster, I’ve gotten used to being doubted. Please take it lightly. And sir, don’t look so depressed, either. Please go easy on yourself…
You didn’t do anything wrong. I agree with you. Let me use the magic item, I can’t let you do all the dirty work.
Dear tranquility princess, I wish to ask you a question. What do you think of us humans?
…Humans are incredibly important to me; I’d even go so far as to say they’re a necessity.
Sorry for suspecting you. Please forgive me. But this way, we can officially put our skepticism to rest… See, Kazuma? Be more positive. It’s a rare opportunity for us to end a mission peacefully.
What happened to the adventurers and visitors who died here, after you’ve accompanied them for their final stretch? Did you absorb their bodies for nutrients?
Y-you…!
As you’ve said, us humans are supposedly very important to you; however, is that because we provide nutrients for your own survival?
I will ask this again. What did you do with the bodies of the adventurers? Did you absorb them? Yes, or no?
Yes, they did become my food. They’ve become a part of me… They will live on inside my body. I’ll never forget them… Are you satisfied now?
Kazuma, you’re a villain after all. What happened to your humanity!? Tell me where you left it so I can go fetch it for you! Same deal as when you had your memory erased; did you even forget how to be civilized!?
Kazuma, not sure if I should criticize your way of speaking or form of questioning… She did stop Aqua from touching her roots earlier, so she definitely absorbed those people unintentionally.
…Look, I have a request for you all. Could I have some alone time with her?
As a fiendish, heartless NEET, why would you want alone time with the innocent and pure tranquility princess!?
Could you be planning to pull off what you had done to the tranquility girl at the Crimson Demon village? Killing her off while we’re gone to victoriously inform us that she’s dead?
Am I that incredible?I will not chop her down while you’re away. See? The magic item agrees.
Kazuma, I know that it is our duty as adventurers to eliminate monsters—a necessary one at that. But please, don’t push yourself too hard and dig your own grave!
So, be honest now. I know your true form. No need to play dumb, just tell the truth.
…Man, isn’t it exhausting to live with paranoia?
Showing your true self at last? Little plant lecturing a human?
What a narrow-minded man. No wonder you’re a virgin.
Hey, I’m not okay with being called a virgin by a plant. Where does a monster learn vocabulary like that? Which adventurer taught you?
Living so long this way makes you wise… What about you? Which of those three shall you mate with?
See that’s why I hate monsters; no manners whatsoever. Plus, they’re all friends, don’t look at us through such an indecent lens. Don’t tempt me to uproot you entirely.
Your friends would charge in if you were to do that. Do you not even mind hurting their affinity levels? Besides, stop making excuses; male humans should be in heat all year round, shouldn’t they?
What male humans; what breeding; what heat!? Change your vocabulary already! Us humans employ a graceful and patient approach to the subject matter. Humans are intricate creatures—worlds apart from you monsters.
Well, weren’t you staring at these when we first met?
That’s instinctual for male humans. Just like how you plants photosynthesize and release seeds carelessly during spring—it’s a reflexive process.
Putting aside photosynthesis, the way in which we reproduce has much more finesse than just crudely spreading seeds. Don’t compare me to the uncivil, inferior regular plants that reproduce without control. We tranquility monsters spread by convincing humans to transport our saplings faraway for us. I was once rooted elsewhere, and requested a human to bring me someplace where monsters and adventurers are both weak. Thus, I settled here.
In addition, unlike you constantly breeding humans and goblins, we germinate once every century. Unlike your mindless multiplication, we seek harmony and balance with nature.
Don’t drag us down to the same level as goblins! Now that you mention it, life as a plant is sure hard.
…so, you’ve found my true self, very well. What will you do about it?
Isn’t it obvious? I’m an adventurer and you’re a monster. We’re blatantly enemies and not compatible whatsoever.
What in theworlddid I do wrong? Everyone who came here did soontheir own accord! They’d much rather have me send them off to meet theirGodsthan die alone! It’s only fair that I feed off their bodies in exchange. The adventurers passed away without pain, without loneliness; it’s ablessing! I, in turn, also live awonderfullife having quality nutrients at my disposal. Why are you so ticked off bythispositive cycle of mutual benefit? What a faux-humanitarian!
Did you think dropping your shell would make you any less a scorpion? I’ve come to kill you. According to the Adventurer’s Guild, because you’ve converted this forest to a suicide paradise, their reputation took a hit. To prevent more people from seeking their doom here, they’re putting up an eye-catching warning sign at the entrance.
Hold on a second, don’t jump to conclusions yet. All aside, you do know that you can’t harm me, right?
I’ve rooted here since nearly a hundred years ago. Do you honestly believe that no one before has found my true self during all this time? Do you know what became of them?
Oh, chill out there. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t planning to assassinate you in the dark. Rather, it was supposed to be an incentive for you.
What’s that supposed to mean?
Dig down. You’ll find valuable things in there.
Aren’t you a little too human-esque? Even trying bribery.
Isn’t it nonetheless a good trade for both? You’d get the money, and I’ll be spared. Guess this is a win-win. As I’ve said, we aim to live in harmony with nature.
You’ve found the wrong guy. Name’s Kazuma, Satou Kazuma; the adventurer from Axel who has exterminated numerous Demon Generals. Please don’t put me on their level, alright? My excellence so far has earned me more than enough money.
Hey, hey, hold it, calm down. I understand now that you’re a strong man not prone to greed or lust. No, I frankly underestimated you. You’re the cleverest adventurer I’ve met thus far; a real adventurer with admirable virtue.
Trying to butter me up after your bribery failed, huh. It’s a shame, for as someone who has showed off his skills plenty of times, I’m no longer swayed by such meager compliments. After all, just recently, I’ve been making the maids in the city list out at least 10 good points about me on a daily basis.
What in the world is wrong with you!? Even as a monster I find you insane.
…Hey, what’s that? Wait a second, what are you doing?
Behold, herbicide.
I get it, let’s pause for a moment and keep chatting. If you aren’t okay with me living here, go ahead and move me to someplace in those faraway mountains… Also, please note, I’m making it clear that I did not encourage humans to shorten their lifespan; furthermore, I’ve even helped old adventurers with their toilet businesses. To be honest, much of the contents from their stories I’ve had to hear countless of times over and over. My life is filled with hardships, too! Don’t I deserve at least a little benefit?
How should I go about moving you? Isn’t this big tree a part of you?
My body consists of this whole forest. Since my roots are everywhere, you only have to dig it all up…
How is that possible!? You do know how big this forest is, right!?
Oi, is this a joke? Didn’t you say you wouldn’t harm me? The lie detecting magic item didn’t ring, did it? Unless you changed your mind? Isn’t this a bit too suspicious!? You’re only threatening me, right!?
I never said I wouldn’t harm you. Remember how you cleverly cherrypicked your words? What I said was, ‘I will not chop her down while you’re away.’ I didn’t chop you down, did I? I wasn’t lying.
You gotta be joking, right!? I-I understand, we can talk! I’ll do anything I can! …Look, for example, I can let you play with these things you’ve been constantly staring at all you want!
Oh please, I couldn’t really help it, could I? Putting the remains of the dead to use is a type of recycling–an environmentally friendly process. They’d turn into dust anyway, so why not let me absorb them?
…Say, don’t these excite you at least in the slightest?
Not at all.
Look, why don’t we both speak truthfully? Nobody is around, see? You still are interested just a little, right?
Siphoning nutrients from the earth is what makes us plants, just as how your urge to grab boobs is a defining attribute of males. Why criminalize basic instincts? Monsters are living, you’re also living! Come on, follow your instincts, let nature guide your life!
The hell was I doing!? You’re too dangerous; you almost made me crossthe lineof humanity!
YAAAAAAGH—!
What what? The hell happened!? Hey Kazuma, what did you do!?
Kazuma, what are you spraying? Could it be weed killer!?
You came at just the right time! Help me out here, this bastard is indeed something shady!
What in my own name did you do while we were gone? You must have exploited that dingalingy magic item, right? Explain the situation at once!
Do as Aqua had said, explain yourself.
This guy suddenly tried to do unspeakable things to me…!
Enough! No more from you!
Kazuma, this really is difficult to digest. Why don’t you explain what exactly happened here?
She is indeed devious, rambling on and on when we were alone. Watch. –Say it aloud before the magic item, why don’t you? Did your attitude make a 180 degree turn while Aqua and company weren’t present? If your face didn’t flip, go ahead, and tell it to this thing!
Oi, out with that attitude, you’ll worsen their impression of me! Stop resisting and tell the truth!
This gentleman had always been strongly interested in my chest area…
What are you talking about all of the sudden…
You’ve got some skill! That was honestly unexpected. Although, I’m also experienced at using this magic item to my advantage. Everyone, watch this: this tranquility princess, right here, fell utterly indecent when you guys had left, spewing obscene remarks constantly. It was truly hard to watch!
I-I do admit that my language was unbecoming; however, please allow me to explain!
what in the world did you two talk about
Y-you; weren’t you poised to cop my breasts a while ago!?
Because you told me to! You were the one who let me squeeze them to my heart’s content in exchange for sparing you!
I didn’t say it so lewdly, don’t put words in my mouth!
Damn, what a waste of time! Talking to you is fruitless, I should have taken action immediately! That’s the treatment you deserve! Taste my weed killer!
S-stop it! What a despicable move against an immobile monster! It’s so low of you to resort to brute force after losing the verbal battle!
You’re too noisy, a mere monster is in no place to talk reason! Hey, are you trying to resist? Take it in or I’ll shoot you!
Stop right now! Don’t be ridiculous! Stop putting such dirty stuff on me! I’m getting polluted! Save me, I-I’m being polluted by all this fluid on my nether regions…
How could you make everything sound so obscene? I’m merely spraying weed killer near your base!
—Terrible sign; I feel like vomiting yet I couldn’t—nor do I have the required internal organs to do so—nonetheless, I’m feeling extremely sick…
Great, here’s your chance; you girls, help me spray more herbicide!
D-don’t look at me that way; I was right, see? While she didn’t lie, she didn’t tell the truth either. Even I’m not low enough to be attracted by the bosom of a monster.
Ohohohoho…
Watch, little adventurer, as you are called by the shameful title of ‘monster-con’ for life! Spraying such disgusting stuff on me, you’ll go to hell for that, petty virgin!
Says the one getting drunk off weed killer! If I’m going to hell, you’re coming with me!
Again, turning to physical assault when you know you’re losing! Can’t you spell ‘shame’!? Did you finally erupt out of humiliation!? A while ago, you even claimed to be a professional adventurer; how embarrassing, a professional adventurer who’s still a virgin! Being a virgin despite having three females around you, are you sexually defective or what? You even called them friends; well guess what, you might very well be the only one who thinks that way. They probably are comfortable with you yet possibly too close to be ‘just friends’…
So disgusting! So…disgusting…! Damn this petty virgin! My roots span across the entire forest! Removing me entirely would take decades! Do you hope to eliminate me in your lifetime? Fine! Even though it’ll be way more trouble than what the treasures are worth, you can go ahead and dig as you wish!
—Kazuma-san, you’ve worked hard. Thank you for subjugating the tranquility princess!
That really was deathly exhausting, took too much effort!
The tranquility princess is so scary, I’m not going anywhere near her forest…
Say, Kazuma… Am I really that insignificant? Do people really not care about me? A lot of things make sense when she puts it that way… Aqua and Megumin both had their chances to shine yesterday; and today, you single-handedly defeated the tranquility princess. Is she really right about me being useless? According to her, I might as well be a snail made of adamantite; is that really true?
Waga na wa Megumin, the number one genius of the Crimson Demon Clan and the apex archwizard in all of Axel. It’s all fine; I’m unmatched; It’s not like I’m bottom-rung in the clan. Words of a monster mean nothing to me, including the ‘you call yourself a resilient lone-wolf when in fact you just can’t make friends’ part. It’s all fine, I have friends here, I have my dear friends. It’s all fine, all fine, all fine…
Nothing can go wrong
something will definitely go wrong). In this case, Megumin’s denial is blatantly the “I’m fine but not actually
I knew Satou-san could do it for sure! That was none other than the tranquility princess! The tranquility princess that many adventurers had given up subjugating! Because a number of people had claimed that the tranquility princess was harmless, the bounty is very small… however, having a monster close to the city still had a large impact on the guild’s image! Furthermore, even though the quest for Satou-san had only been reconnaissance, you still went ahead and subjugated it. We’re truly thankful for this!
I only defeated her upper portion, please also remove all the roots under the whole forest without trace. Speaking of which, why do you trust that I’d be able to defeat the tranquility princess?
Could it be because you see me as a man so heartless that he won’t have moral issues killing even the tranquility princess?
Well then, Satou Kazuma-san, you’ve done well this time! Goodbye Komekko! Come play again tomorrow!
Not so fast, I’m not done yet! In addition, I will not be bringing Komekko again. In fact, starting tomorrow, I won’t be coming either! I’ve grown tired of all this business. Now that I’ve finished the toughest of thedurian quests, you guys can’t complain anymore!
I’ll be preparing a huge cake tomorrow.
I’ll come.
Come here for a second, Komekko. I have something to tell you.
I’m not sure what went on, but onee-chan looks angry, so I don’t wanna.
Komekko!
Listen closely. How many times did I tell you to not ask food from strangers? Both today and the day before. How could you, a Crimson Demon, be so easily baited by food…?
Back in the village, onee-chan told me to nag anyone I see for food.
Oi.
That is that and this is this. In a small community like the Crimson Demon village, the people we meet are most likely familiar. In cities like this, however, you should never naively accept meals from strangers. After all, we don’t know what they might possibly demand in return.
I refuse.
Komekko! This is not something you can ‘refuse’; what would you do when everyone knows that you’d obey anyone who gives you free food? I’m only telling you this because I know you dumbly follow strangers.
Of course I would dumbly follow strangers and let them feed me.
Stop being stupid and listen carefully!
Onee-chan is so irritable.
Hold it Komekko, running is no use! Watch as I teach you a grave lesson today!
Komekko, get your butt out here at once or else there will be no dinner for you!
I’ll come out when there’s no food left in here.
Komekko, stop saying nonsense! We’d have no dinner if you don’t open the door; we must start cooking now, so open up… Komekko, what are you eating in there!? Don’t make rash moves and come out! Or else, I’m tearing this door down!
No need to break the kitchen door for a mere sibling fight.
However, Kazuma, if we don’t teach her right now, we’d regret it sooner or later. We can’t afford to be too late.
Real convincing from someone who had been corrected ‘too late’ herself.
Oi, if you want to fight, I’m all for it!
Let’s show ‘em, onii-san!
Komekko! Stirring up fights while hiding inside is too despicable! Come on, get out of there!
I found a big chocolate in the cabinet!
Komekko!? That’s not for eating, I prepared that specifically for… Komekko, I understand! I won’t be mad, so just come out! Let’s make up!
I’ll come out as soon as I finish this.
Komekko—!
Komekko! Komekko where are you!?
What’s going on at such an hour? What are you screaming about?
Good morning, Kazuma. I’m looking for Komekko. Get a load of this kid. She probably didn’t even bother waiting for breakfast and took off after grabbing some food from the kitchen.
How should I put this? Your sister really is a wild one.
I don’t remember bringing up such a wild child either. Who is she trying to become?
who else besides you?
On the other hand, since she’s never been outside of the Crimson Demon village, Axel must intrigue her. She should be back soon if she went to prance around the town.
Makes sense. I myself had been overwhelmed by this city on day one, so I can relate…
—Say, Megumin, where did Komekko go? I lost to her last night, and I was just about to take revenge.
You lose to even little girls? As an adult, don’t you feel ashamed at all?
Don’t be dumb, Kazuma, haven’t you heard of ‘handicapping’? Since she’s a child, I thought, I should be more merciful. Ultimately, my hubris was the end of me. I started the game one piece down—the weakest piece, Adventurer.
That’s hardly a handicap.
Although, since she hasn’t been back for this long, could she be playing with other kids somewhere or begging for snacks at the guild again?
Possibly. Although, I don’t think she will get along very well with other kids of her age, so she’s unlikely to be anywhere besides the guild. After all, didn’t they say something about preparing a fruit cake for her?
Although, it was all thanks to Komekko’s presence that the adventurers got the willpower to clear out all thedurian quests. They have the right to invite her over for snacks; it’s only reasonable.
Well then, let’s also head for the guild after we eat.
independence from her little sister
Here, try this too, onee-san made this herself.
Over here, young lady, also try this.
Thank you!
You’re the onee-san from that shop I frequent, right? But this is the Adventurer’s Guild! What do you intend to do here!?
Ara! Why, isn’t this our renowned customer? We’ve had our lesson, of course we know it’s dangerous here…
We’re not sure why, but we just couldn’t leave her alone. It’s most likely her unusually high demonic potential. She’ll certainly become someone highly important… So, if we win her over early…
So uhm, since Aqua-sama has blessed us with her presence, we shall take our leave.
Customer-san, please keep an eye on Aqua-sama and Vanir-sama for us! So, Komekko, I guess we’ll see you later?
…Say, Kazuma, what exactly is your relationship with those people? This is the first time I’ve seen such pretty women in your friend circle…
They are employees of a café run by some beautiful ladies. Though the dishes are only ordinary, they’re peculiarly popular, which leaves me baffled. Still, why would they be so attracted to my little sister?
Greetings, Megumin-san.
Megumin-san, we’re essentially finished with the quests. Within the span of the last two days, all the notable missions have all been dealt with in a rapid succession.
Megumin-san
Really. Then I need not worry about being forced to take difficult quests. Everyone’s been working their butts off, and I’ve been stressing out lately.
Onee-chan, the adventurers of this city are so strong!
Indeed, indeed. After all, they’re from the city that I live in.
The blue-haired onee-san is also very powerful!
That’s right. As expected for being my friend. She purified a spectre that’s been around for a long time. So, while Aqua is usually dumb likethat,I encourage you to see her in a more positive light.
And, the onii-san is also powerful!
Mhm, he’s nonetheless the leader of our party. There’s no way he’snotpowerful… Although, I still question whether he was truly ‘victorious’ given the tactics he used…
…Eh? Uh-um, what aboutmybig moments…?
You didn’t have any, did you?
See, Komekko? My friends are powerful, right? The adventurers of this city are all very cool, right? When you get back to the village…be sure to brag about us all.
Say, Kazuma, the tranquility princess was right, wasn’t she? That I’m no more useful than an adamantite snail?
Please stop stressing over losing to a plant, leave it behind.
Except onee-chan isn’t powerful.
…K-Komekko, what did you just say? You said that I, your mighty onee-chan, isn’t powerful?
Mhm, only onee-chan isn’t really powerful.
K-Komekko! What’s going on, have you entered the age of rebellion!? You’ve been learning strange words and have been disobedient to me lately; you are making your older sister feel heartbroken, you know!?
I have a request for you, big-breasted onee-san.
Komekko, I’d prefer if you don’t call me ‘big-breasted onee-san’, if you please.
Please give us a quest that can make my not-so-powerful onee-chan more powerful.
Komekko, let’s go home! My true abilities can only show at the key moments; so normally, I’m pretty lackluster. Let’s go, I’ll put on an explosion firework show tonight after we get home.
Hmm~… To be fair, there aren’t many big quests left. The remaining quests are mostly giant toad subjugation… After all, this city isn’t exactly known for its livestock industry; with toad meat also being delicious, there’s never been a lack of demand. So, this is the only reliable, always ongoing quest.
That will do.
That will do? But giant toads are very weak monsters, they’re only loved for food…
Thatwilldo.
Why areyoutaking quests!? You even accepted a giant toad subjugation quest which is not hard at all. You chose it for the toad meat, didn’t you? Well then, onee-chan will let you witness her true power! Come on, there must still be some big quests left, right? Bring them on, go big or go home. Mind you, I’m feeling incredibly competent today; so, bring whatever you have to me,be it Demon Generals or dragons!
Be it Demon Generals or dragons…huh? If you put it that way, we actually do have onedurian questleft…
Hey, don’t embarrass Megumin-san!
That’s right, she clearly said she wanted to do it, is that not enough?
Yeah yeah, they aren’t a hesitant bunch, so what’s with the hold-up at this point?
Like the adventurers said, I already claimed “I’d do it
Onee-chan must be very powerful!
Understood. In that case, I shall reserve this finaldurian questfor Megumin-san.
Waga na wa Megumin, the elite archwizard of Axel, the master of Explosion Magic! In any duel, all shall succumb before the power of my explosions, be it Demon Generals or dragons!
Ooohohohoho!
Oho! Then we shall go lend a hand, too!
This final quest…isn’t the subjugation of a single monster, but a duo consisting of the griffon and the manticore that have been fighting over territory for ages…
Manticore and griffon. Now that you mention it, I do remember seeing a quest like that before.
Don’t you recall? When we were still buried in debt, we even considered taking this quest.
Was that a thing? I’m a forgiving and forgetful woman; I don’t linger over past matters.
A cool line like that should’ve been by said by someone more likeable than you.
Still, we’ve come a long way. Back when we were little ducklings, we couldn’t have dreamed of taking on tasks like this.
Yeah, back then we constantly went on missions just to pay our debt. I couldn’t even believe myself, but compared to the leisurely life saturated with wealth we have now, the times plagued by debt when we had to work our butts off everyday felt more satisfying…
That is calledrose-tinted retrospection. Most people tend to glorify the past.
Don’t put it like that, Kazuma. It’s not like I can’t relate with Megumin at all. We really were newbies back then, being tortured by all kinds of monsters including giant toads. But in hindsight, those memories are really…
Nah, you guys haven’t changed much. Though you did in fact defeat several Demon Generals and tough monsters, Aqua-san cried a while ago when a neroid she had chased into an alley lashed back at her.
Oi, didn’t I tell you to not spread stories like this!? Why did you think I spent my own precious cash to buy ice cream for you!? That was a bribe for non-disclosure! Since you’ve broken our contract, you better give me my ice cream back!
I helped you get rid of the neroid; I’ll take the ice cream as a show of gratitude.
if you ever get hurt and need my healing magic, you’d have to pay me, too.
The griffon has showed up—!
Kazuma! This one’s even bigger than we imagined! With a beak this fabulous, could it be a relative of Emperor Zell?
Would you stop spoutingn o n s e n s e! M-Megumin, go chant your spell! Put the unseen manticore aside and take care of the griffon first! This thing has top priority!
G-g-g-g-got it! Leave it to me!
Alright, I’ll be the meat shield! This will be my big moment; I must convince Komekko to say that the onee-san in armor is also very powerful! Even though we’re facing a griffon, it’s by itself! We have numbers, if we concentrate our will, we’ll definitely prevail!
Ara, that’s no way to be. Although the griffon is incredibly bothersome, without it, you humans would have invaded this mountain.
I’ll handle this
I-it’s headed here! Hey, Megumin, that damn bastard is coming for you! Stop chanting for now; if we don’t keep our distance, it’ll wreck us!
W-w-w-wait a second, Kazuma! Don’t shake me! The manticore has high intelligence. It was alerted by the threat of my dangerous spell, so it raised our priority. A-ah, it’s c-coming!
Eat this! Snipe!
…The hell is this?
Megumin—! My arrow was deflected, what now!?
It was simply not strong enough! Manticores are high-tier monsters that shouldn’t be around here! To it, beginner adventurers’ attacks are only that: an annoyance!
Aha! You sure give the gentleman vibe, little boy! Oi, wanna see what I can do with this meat whip!?
Eh!?
Create Earth!
Leave this to me, Kazuma! Large monsters like manticores and griffons need magic to fly! What I’m saying is, without magic, they’ll fall right out of the sky!
Hey wait, nothing good ever comes of anything you do! Just let me use the blinding combo like usual and…!
Sacred Break Spell!
Whooooooooaaaahhhh!?
Owowowowowow!
Not bad, boy! You really are something, if I do say so!
Not bad my ass! Same deal with Sylvia; why are hybrid monsters all like this!?
Come on, just try taking a shot from my meat whip…!? Gah, wh-what’s this now!?
Anyone, please come save me—! I’m about to lose some very important things!
!?
Bring it on, bastard; you’ve been acting weirdly for a while now. I actually have a phobia for the likes of you! Now, watch me overcome my fears and tear you up!
Gah! Another manticore! It’s female, a female manticore!
Did she follow along!? Female manticores are stronger! Let’s take her on!
Boy, you’ve got some nerve. A duel, is that what you want!? A duel!? How manly; well, allow me to pierce♂the♂heavens from your backyard!
Spare me! Please spare me!!
Kazuma, I’m ready! Leave this to me!
Don’t waste such a spell on the manticore! The griffon is far stronger, so leave this cannon fodder be and strike over there!
U-understood! I’ve indeed heard rumors saying that the griffon’s level is higher!
Ohh? You dare say I’m weaker even after years of sustained combat?
Lalatina!
Hey, is everything okay!?
Lalatina is under heavy assault from the griffon! No, wait, she appears somewhat happy; she seems very calm and serene…!
Yes, it’s working! Hey, Kazuma—! We’ll come help as soon as we get rid of the other manticore!
Oi, if you want to save your wife then go ahead. The archwizard holding her magic behind me is the best in Axel. Keep fighting here, or go save your wife? The choice is yours.
Things aren’t going too well today! I’ll leave you alone. What I’m saying is, I choose to help my wife…
They got Lalatina!
Kazuma-san, please do something quick! Darkness is about to be abducted! This reminds me of how Emperor Zell caught worms from the yard this morning; Darkness, in her current state, uncannily resembles a worm that’s about to be eaten by Emperor Zell!
Stop with the negative foreshadowing at this critical moment; why must you always do unnecessary things!?
Darkness, hang in there! Megumin, get ready to unleash your spell!
Hitting such a big target should be no problem! No tricks up your sleeve this time!
Eeeeeeeeek!
you deserved it!
Megumin, go! By the power of the best archwizard in Axel, blow all three of them asunder!
After we return to Axel, this glorious moment of mine must be told word for word to my little sister.Waga na wa Megumin! The elite archwizard of Axel, the master of Explosion Magic! …Now, have a taste of the ultimate attack I’ve been holding all this time! E x p l o s i o n—!
I’m calling quits. Look, Kazuma, I’m declaring a break from quests.
Say, Kazuma, I want to ask: did we really improve at all? We’ve never matured one bit since we formed the party, have we?
Don’t ask me; that’s what I want to know.
I want to apologize to Kazuma-san for something… I can never fathom the idea of returning to the olden days again.
—Thanks for the work, everyone! Also, congratulations! With that, everydurian questin the city has been completed! On behalf of all staff members of the Adventurer’s Guild, I thank you all sincerely!
So great! Everyone is so great!
Yeah, we’re great, aren’t we? It’s because we’re adventurers of Axel! Although, your big sister is the greatest. After all, Megumin was the one who killed the griffon and the manticore en masse!
-san
Megumin
Onee-chan is the best!
Kazuma, are you awake? If you are, may I interrupt for a second?
I’m still awake; about to sleep, though.
No… It took massive effort for me to visit, don’t be so quick to fall asleep!
What are you here for this late in the night? Komekko rarely stays over, are you sure you don’t want to accompany her? Although I haven’t a clue when your parents will come pick her up, she can’t stay here forever, can she?
No, um… Actually, Yunyun came to me just a while ago.
hiding
And then? What happened to Yunyun? Did she come to play with Komekko?
Nope. She was here to pass a message from the Crimson Demon village, that the Demon Army occupying the village has been successfully repelled.
Isn’t that good news? Although, that would also mean…
That’s right, I heard that my mother will be picking up Komekko tomorrow.
All the more reasons you should sleep by her side tonight; are you sure you would rather be here?
It’s fine, no problem. She’s a tough child. Or rather, I’m afraid I’m the one who gets hurt more if I stayed with her any longer.
Kazuma, thanks for all your help these past few days, I’m extremely grateful.
Don’t be such a stranger. Mhm, even though I nearly lost something precious due to my laziness and degeneracy, it makes me happy knowing that everything’s like when it started.
Indeed, the battle we had today felt akin to the ones we fought long ago… Say, this counts as a sign of growth, right?
By the way, do you still remember? That time when we first met?
Of course I do; you told me a confusing and awkward name as complete strangers, then abruptly fell to the floor. On top of that, the next thing to come out of your mouth was something about not having eaten for three darn days. Who in the world can forget an experience like that?
Oi, how many times do I have to say this: if you have a problem with my name then tell it to my face.
Kazuma, I actually knew you before then.
Perhaps Kazuma and Aqua don’t know about this, but I was in fact familiar with the two of you before I joined the party.
Haw.
……Let me explain; it’s because of all the fuss you two had made. Getting in trouble at every turn, raging and crying all the time. Be it working at the guild vineyard, working at the grocery; you two managed to get yelled at everywhere. And that’s how I memorized you two.
Oi. So you’re saying that we left basically no good impressions?
However, despite everything, the two of you always seemed to be enjoying yourselves. That was the real reason I chose your party; at the time, I was thinking of all the fun I could also be having if I adventured with you.
Although, if someone told me at the time that ‘I would take a liking to Kazuma’, there’s not a chance that I would have believed them either.
Huh? Was my first impression that bad? It’s quite hurtful of you to describe me that way.
Kazuma Kazuma,
What now? I’m getting very sleepy, so could you stop bothering me? The alcohol is really taking a toll on my ability to stay awake.
It’s about time for us to advance our relationship to somewhere between friends and lovers.
—Sorry for the trouble Kazuma-san, thanks for taking care of my daughters.
No no no, it was nothing. I should thank your daughter for taking care of me…
When you said ‘thank your daughter for taking care of me’, in which context did you mean by ‘taking care’? Though I wouldn’t mind whatever it might mean. After all, my daughter has reached the age to seek romantic partnership…
age to seek romantic partnership
unwanted age
Taking care as in while fighting and adventuring; I didn’t mean anything strange by it.
I know, I know; I’ve heard everything from my daughter. I understand you very well, Kazuma-san. Everything’s fine as long as you can take the responsibility.
daughter
The blue-haired onee-san is so great, she punched a ghost with her bare fists. The armored onee-san is also very great, she got eaten by a giant bird. Onee-chan’s boyfriend is also super great, he killed a woman with weed killer. Onee-chan is alsosuper-duper great, not sure why yet.
Onee-chan isn’t with me tonight, I think she went to her boyfriend’s room, then when I went to check, I heard her saying something like being between friends and lovers.
Komekko! So you were awake that entire time! How dare you eavesdrop on me!? When did you start listening in!?
There’s no need to hide it; as a mother, I’m satisfied so long as you are happy.
Well, Kazuma-san, we’ll be calling farewell now… On another note, though I’ve heard rumors about it before, I didn’t believe your mansion would be this luxurious. With that, I can now entrust my daughter to you without reluctance.
Goodbye onii-san, I want to eat frogs again the next time I visit.
Yuiyui, ancestor of mine! Dost thou honestly have no better topic to discuss during this precious reunion with your beloved daughter!?
Hurry up and have a kid.
Hey, mom…!
Live a great life, all. I’ve already thought of a name for my grandchild.
Teleport!
How much longer were you planning to sleep? Komekko has already left.
Eh!? Why!? Didn’t we agree to go catch neroids together today?
I’m really sorry for the trouble I brought upon everyone this time… really sorry for everyone having to deal with my mother and sister…
Come to think of it, wasn’t everything caused by your heroic posturing before your parents?
Since I’m happy, I’ll let it slide. We could invite her over anytime anyway; we’ll have go catch neroids together next time.
Oi, Kazuma… About what Megumin’s mother said a while ago…
Mommy——!
Then let’s begin, Dustiness-dono. Even if you are my opponent… No, it is because you are my opponent that I will not hold back!
Agreed, Shinfornea-dono. Shinfornea of the sword. Dustiness of the shield. Together we are the two noble families that have protected this kingdom through the years. Let us decide which of us is superior here and now!
—Iris was so incredible back then. No really, it was amazing! I think my little sister is the strongest in the world!
Onii-sama, you seem to only talk like that when it’s about me, but you shouldn’t forget that this nation is filled with talented people. In particular, Claire and Lalatina are my prided retainers.
Even if you say that, I fear that I cannot win against Kazuma.
Now that you mention it, Kazuma-dono is certainly someone who would give me a hard time as well. That said, I would hesitate to call the way he fights as ‘combat’.
Onii-sama, you had a match with Lalatina as well?
Mhm, I did. Well, I’m the guy who defeated the hero of the demon sword, so It’s a given that they would lose to me, right? There’s nothing for them to be embarrassed about.
You really are full of mysteries, onii-sama. Your level is not particularly high and your stats are all so low, but for some reason you still manage to win in the end. I don’t know anyone quite as miraculous as you.
That’s right. That’s exactly right. Listen Iris, there are a lot of things in this world which cannot be measured by numbers alone. What’s truly important is this.
Pectorals!?
The heart.
Oh. By the way Onii-sama, who was trickier for you to handle, Lalatina or Claire?
Hmm, if I had to choose, It’d probably be Darkness. All in all, she’s really tough and has a lot of stamina. Metaphorically speaking, she’s pretty much a barbarian.
Might I suggest a change of wording perhaps? Or would you prefer to experience my ‘toughness’ firsthand?
As for Claire, she admitted defeat after I stripped her of her panties so I really can’t say much about her. Either way, haven’t the two of you already fought before?
Lalatina lives in Axel, so there hasn’t been a chance for that… But that said, a little part of me does want to see how the two would fight one another.
—KIEEEEEEHHH-!
Dustiness-dono, do you understand that this is not a deathmatch but a spar!?
And what about it? There’s no need to worry. After all, we have Aqua who can use ‘Resurrection’ in case something happens, so don’t hold back! Come at me like you wanted to kill me! Now, let us continue with all due haste! I look forward to a much sharper strike than that! Show me the true strength of the Household of Swords!
What has come over you Dustiness-dono!? What has become of your ever-present reason!?
Onii-sama, in your eyes, who do you think is better?
You’re asking for my personal opinion? Given my familiarity with her, I would probably favor Darkness. On second inspection though, Claire isn’t looking too bad, but in certain ways, she doesn’t quite measure up to Darkness.
Sorry about this, Shinfornea-dono, but it seem like he has quite a bit of faith in me, so as regrettable as it is, it’s time for me to stop playing around. Let’s finish this.
You certainly seem to have a high opinion of Lalatina, Onii-sama. Is the difference between the two really that great?
First off, Claire is way too slender, if you know what I mean. By my personal taste, I much prefer Darkness’ figure. Second, long hair scores high points in my book. No… short hair isn’t exactly bad either, you know? But in truth, Darkness has a better body and bigger chest, so it would only be fair for her to win out in the end.
Onii-sama, what are you talking about!? I was talking about who you thought stronger, not who is more to your taste!
So then, I said this. ‘Before my explosion magic, a dragon is naught but a lizard…!’ After that, Iris made eye contact with me as if to tell me that ‘I will concede this prey to you’.
Oh my!
In that moment, I thought to myself. ‘Would it not be for the greater good were I to concede this grand accomplishment to Iris…?’ While it is certain that my explosion magic can slay a dragon with ease, my explosion magic is simply far too powerful. If I were to strike it with my grand magic, there is no doubt that naught would be left of the dragon’s valuable corpse.
The purpose of our journey was to obtain the wealth needed to fight against the demon king army. If my opponent were just a dragon, then I, a crimson magic clansman, can beat it without breaking a sweat. However, I ask of you all, would there be any meaning it doing that!? Having found my answer, I decided that I would only make my move if Iris were to miss her chance, so I prepared my magic and patiently looked on.
How wonderful!
As one would expect of the wise Crimson Magic Clansmen. The wisdom to be able to consider so many factors in an instant is truly superb!
What happened next, Megumin-dono? How was the dragon defeated? Please continue!
’Sacred· Explode’. When Iris shouted that, the entire mountain was covered in light…! Then before I knew it, the dragon was dead.
That’s our Iris-sama! Her talents stand out even amongst royalty!
Would it not be best for Iris-sama herself to personally embark to slay the demon king?
Before that, you would have to convince His Majesty. Surely you know how much he dotes on Iris?
However, is it not because our final trump card, Iris-sama, is present at the capital that we may send the greater half of our forces to the frontlines without worry…?
That aside, the power is as one would expect of the world’s strongest skill. The security of Belzerg is practically guaranteed!
’Sacred· Explode’. Doesn’t this name remind you all of something else?
What does it remind me of…? The name’Sacred· Explode’ reminds me that it is a legendary sword skill that only the most talented of the royal family, armed with the holy sword, can use,
No, wait.
’Sacred· Explode’… Isn’t the name ‘Explode’ eerily similar to ‘Explosion’? Perhaps there is some relationship between them… Ah, probably not huh…
That’s it!
You sir have some very keen insight. Yes,’Sacred· Explode’ and ‘Explosion’ have pretty similar names, do they not? Do you all understand what this means?
To be honest, I don’t think there’s any special meaning behind the similar names.
Shut up for a moment, Kazuma.
Allow me to tell everyone this. The magic, ‘Explosion’, is humanity’s penultimate attack that was devised by a certain grand magician who devoted his life to opposing the absolute beings that exceed human knowledge. If a dragon will meet its end in one strike, then what of demons and gods? Even such great existences will be damaged by this magic of unparalleled destruction.
’Explosion’ and‘Explode’. One is the ultimate magic, and the other the ultimate strike. At this point, it would be strange for you all to fail to see the connection, especially after I have said so much… Yes, the creator of the ultimate strike bore reverence towards this ultimate magic and invented this skill through reference!
I-, Is that so?
No, but the names are certainly quite similar…
Simply put, this skill is a rip-off of ‘Explosion’. Then would it not be correct to say that the dragon was merely defeated by a poor-man’s ‘Explosion’?
What the heck are you saying?
Shut up, Kazuma.
Oi, haven’t you thrown everyone into disorder with your statements? What’s are you going to do if the scholars start doing intensive research because of this?
Do you mean to complain about my conclusion of what the strongest skill is? To start with, the very fact that Explosion was even compared to other inferior skills is very irritating. I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong.
Remember when we visited the castle a while back? You got full of yourself and called yourself a grand magician, but when people pestered you to show some advanced magic, all you could do was act all flustered. Who knows when that might happen again? Wait, you didn’t say anything crazy like that anywhere else did you?
…N-, Nope, not at all.
Oi, don’t tell me… what the heck did you do this time? Was this in Axel? Or maybe the village? Oh I see, so it is the village, isn’t it!? Now that I think about it, you sent some pretty exaggerated letters a while back didn’t you!? So, what the heck did you tell them this time!?
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san. What about that fat guy over there? Try reading what he’s saying.
You mean that noble old man over there? Alright, leave it to me.
What’s this…? ‘We are out of mushroom sauce for my favorite lizard-dragon dish…? If there was that, the meal would have been perfect…’
I see I see. Hey, isn’t that skill really fun to use? I would learn it if I still could.
You’re not wrong, but let me tell you this. When people are giggling in your direction, you have to be extra extra careful. Even if the person you’re using the skill on doesn’t want you to hear their shit-talking, you’ll be able to read it all in an instant. Some time ago, I used the skill on some female adventurers that were smiling towards me, thinking they were interested in me, and ended up taking some unexpected damage. That said though, I ended up confronting them about that. Heck, I persisted until they gave in and apologized. I even made them continue until I was satisfied.
You’re as shady as ever aren’t you? Well, what about those people over there? Do you see those oji-sans that are about as shady as you? I don’t know what they’re doing, but given how they’re gathered near the wall and murmuring about stuff, I think they’re up to no good. Call it a goddess’ instinct if you like, but I think they’re making some kind of evil plot!
Hmm… interesting. Alright, I’ll give it a try!
Hey, I’m pretty sure they’re up to ‘that’ sort of thing! You know, like stealing the castle maid’s underwear!
‘So, are the rumors true? That Elroad’s prime minister was a pawn of the demon king army?’ ‘Mhm, there’s no doubting it. Events will take a turn for worse if our secret dealings with the prime minister are discovered. If we don’t hurry and destroy the evidence…’
What are we going to do, I thought they were just playing a prank, but it seems that we’ve gotten ourselves into something bigger again.
Hey, I didn’t see or hear anything, but shouldn’t we report whatever it is to Iris, Darkness, or some other big-wig? Once we’re done with that we can clean our hands of it.
Hey, look look, over there. Someone is hitting on Darkness over there.
What?
Kazuma, knowing you, you’ll read what they’re saying, right? Tell me about it, ok?
Alright, listen in. Here’s what that guy is saying. ‘It sure has been a while, Lalatina-sama. Ooh what is this! Since we last met, you have become magnificently beautiful! Your looks lead me astray! You are… yes, you are as beguiling as a death ambrosia blossoming deep in the mountains…’ Sorry, I can’t do this anymore, it’s too embarrassing. That said, I don’t know what a death ambrosia is, but is that really a compliment?
That guy said that in a serious manner? Hey, then what about Darkness? What did she say?
‘What are you saying, Count Befrantz? I heard that you had taken personally to the battlefield the other day and that you have worked up your courage for the moment. You are… yes, you are as courageous greater king goblin…’
Kazuma-san Kazuma-san. This is a personal request from me, but hearing you talking like a girl creeps me out, so you can stop now, alright?
Anyway, I understand the general gist of how lip reading works. Hey Kazuma, I’m going to try to read what they’re saying, so give me the correct answer once I’m done okay?
By the may, Dustiness-sama, would you mind if we discuss a potential engorgement?
See-through Pantsu-loving Dustiness shall wifely…
Alright, people are looking so stop! Don’t start weird rumors about Darkness again!
She really does look like Lalatina-chan! Hey little girl, could you tell me who your dad is!?
Agh, it’s none of your business you drunks! Oi Kazuma, hurry up and do something about these people!
She’s mine!
If you don’t want me to beat you to death then shut it!
Hey Kazuma, isn’t it about time we decide this time’s V.I.P.!?
Don’t you mean M.V.P.? Either way, isn’t it obvious that it would be me!?
Oh? Am I, who showed the secret arts of the Crimson Magic Clan, not the clear MVP?
Didn’t you just mix a few materials or something? Not to mention, the guild’s bartender is probably better at you at that anyway.
Oi oi, if you’ve got a problem with it then why don’t we ask the witness? We can have her decide who did the most this time. Well, not like we all don’t already know what her answer is. It’s obviously none other than me!
So, who do you think is number one?
I have to tell everyone… I need to let everyone in the guild know…
W-Wait, Aqua, hold on a minute! Let me explain!
First I should report to the guild lady, then I need to go to the people in Axis Cult, then I’ll visit the grocer, the butcher, the old lady next door…
Aqua! Don’t jump to conclusions! Would you take a closer look at this kid first!?!
…‘Mommy’?
W-W-Well, for a noble, having children at a young age is almost an obligation. But this is great! Her face, hair and eyes are a splitting image of you! I’m sure she’ll grow up to be a very beautiful lady.
Megumin, that’s not it! There’s a proper explanation for this, just, please, listen to me!
That’s another one of your fetishes, isn’t it? Still, something like this is no laughing matter…
N-n-no, that’s not-
…Come to think about it, it all makes sense. With a personality like yours, there’s no way you could be a virgin at this age! You slut! Just which thug did you fool around with!?
Don’t make me kill you! As if a noble lady get into such a relationship that easily!
What’s your name, young lady?
A-Ah, wait, Sylphina, let me-!
Dustiness ford Sylphina.
How could she be anything other than your daughter?
No, she’s my cousin! It’s only natural for cousins to have the same family name!
-Sylphina, these people here are all companions of mine, so you can relax. Here, introduce yourself.
I’m Sylphina. I’m Mommy’s…Lalatina-sama’s cousin. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. My name is Satou Kazuma, I’m a companion of your Mommy and work as an adventurer in this town. You can call me Onii-chan or Daddy.
What nonsense are you saying? Sylphina’s father is still alive!
Kazuma, Kazuma. What do you think? She looks just like a smaller version of Darkness to me.
She has her face, hair, and eyes, but there still something off. If she is really Darkness’s daughter, I’m sure she’d be much more well built.
Hey, I can hear you, you know!? I already told you she’s my cousin! The reason why she calls me mommy is because I’ve been looking after her since she was young…!
You’re Sylphina, right? I’m Megumin. As you can see, I’m a Crimson Demon, and Axel’s number one mage.
Megumin-sama…
Allow me to do a proper introduction. She’s my cousin, Dustiness ford Sylphina. Due to various circumstances, she has moved to this town…
Exemplar?
S-Shut up, Kazuma. Do you have a of problem with it? Don’t interrupt my story until I’m done!
I see, this cover story is quite detailed indeed.
Yeah, so far it does seem to hold up quite well.
It’s not a cover story! And think about her age! Just how old do I have to be to have a child of this age?
S-Sorry. It’s the first time I’ve seen mommy… Lalatina being this happy.
I’m not happy! Listen closely, Sylphina, you shouldn’t get too close to this man. It’d be a big problem if you end up being influenced by him like Iris-sama was.
You said your name is Sylphina, right? Your mommy might say that, but she’s barged in on onii-san when he was taking a bath, and even snuck into my bedroom at night…
Don’t listen to him, Sylphina! Hey, Megumin, help me say something too!
He’s not really lying, is he?
Me-Megumin!?
Sylphina, did you walk from my parent’s house to this mansion? You shouldn’t push yourself like that. I’ll tell my father, so you should rest here for tonight. Here, lie down on this sofa.
Yes, sorry, Mo-Lalatina.
Mommy’s fine. But, call me by name if people other than them are present.
Okay, Mommy!
Ah, if it’s too painful, we can get Aqua to cast recovery magic-
…Say. Kazuma, where did Aqua go? I thought it was unusually quiet. When did she disappear?
Oh, she snuck out the door right before you started talking.
…Mommy left.
Leaving a small child here all alone… Just what is she thinking…
…Sylphina, right? Darkness will probably come back soon, so why don’t you play a game with us while we wait?
Sure!
–I’m back.
Welcome home, my dear husband. How’s the situation outside the town?
The situation outside the town? Well, there were more than 20 dragons flying about, so I thought I might as well get rid of them. Doesn’t even count as warm-up, really.
Hear that, Kazuma? When you grow up, you have to be as great as your father!
I don’t want to be something as dangerous as an adventurer. I would rather become a merchant who deals with other people and get rich that way. I don’t want to do anything that will risk my life.
Eh?
Y-you can’t do that, Kazuma! What are you saying!? You have the blood of the legendary hero! There are still people who are suffering because of the Demon King! As your mother, I won’t allow you to do that! Darling, please help me talk some sense into him!
Well, calm down, Sylphina. That is indeed a more realistic outlook on our future. Even though he’s talented in combat, as a parent, I still wouldn’t want my child to place himself in danger. Isn’t it fine as long as our son lives a happy life?
W-well, that makes sense… Then, Kazuma, you should aim to make it big as a merchant, then use your wealth to support the other less fortunate heroes.
I would rather use the profit and connections to entice some less intelligent noble ladies to gain power and status. Then I’d enjoy a leisurely lifestyle while basking in the veneration of the people.
Darling, Kazuma…he—! Our son is turning into a delinquent!
Calm down, Sylphina, that kid has always been like this… However, Kazuma, tricking noble ladies isn’t something you should do. As a commoner, the massive difference in status will definitely prevent you from establishing a truly loving relationship. Thus, you should rather look to marry a capable, easygoing and intelligent yet impoverished girl.
You heard what your daddy said, right Kazuma!? Letting your daddy down is very not okay!
In that case, I want to sleep with daddy tonight. I want him to tell me his adventurer stories until I fall asleep.
Eh?
That sounds like a great idea. Darling, go sleep with our son tonight and teach him the ins and outs of being an adventurer. I’ll be sleeping with mommy-…Lalatina-sama tonight.
Having a child doesn’t seem so bad.
Don’t take what I just said the wrong way, I was just saying that creating a successor to my ultimately mortal flesh isn’t a bad idea…
If you want children, I’m ready to help you anytime you want.
What kind of horrible things are you saying in front of a child!?
Sylphina, I heard they played with you today? What did you guys play?
Yes, these two played ‘house’ with me.
So, what did you do?
Listen to this, Kazuma! I was just spreading the news at the guild and other places, and then Darkness got angry beyond belief! I was caught and brutalized by Darkness to the point where I had to use heal on myself, then she threatened to use the power of her family to forbid all the liquor stores in the town from selling alcohol to me. I was only speaking the truth! Don’t you think she’s going too far!?
How about you consider how I feel when I’m greeted with ‘congratulations for having a child’ every time I enter the guild!? The feeling when I get teased by the drunkards and having to let the guild staff speak up for me! And they even asked me who the child’s father is…
It’s all because of me, sorry Mommy… It’s been such a long time, so I just got excited and…
Ah, it’s not your fault, Sylphina! I like children very much and never thought of you as a hassle! It’s just because they were ridiculing me and betting on who the father was…
Kazuma got the most votes, second place being the bear-esque noble guy who disappeared to nowhere. Who was next again? Right, that blonde delinquent whose name I can’t recall was next!
Shut it! I don’t want to hear that from you!
Kazuma, are you still awake? Can I come in?
Sure, I’m awake, but I don’t really want to let you in. After all, the only reason you come here at this time is to play with my emotions and get my hopes up before leaving me with blue balls.
The hell? Don’t make me sound like some sort manipulative bitch! I never tried to play with your emotions!
So, what is up? Do you want me to keep you company while you sleep?
Indeed, I want to sleep with you tonight.
Look, I won’t fall for the same trick again. I’m not like Aqua who never learns from experience. Don’t think I’ll just dumbly fall for your honeyed words just because I’m a teenage virgin.
What are you talking about? Weren’t you the one who wanted to sleep with me tonight? Did you forget about what you said while we were playing with Sylphina?
Wh-what? Why are you so guarded? You too have been sending me all kinds of signals lately, so what are you making such a fuss for?
I’m not making a fuss. I’m just frustrated about being that typical male protagonist from a low-quality romcom who always gets cut-off mid development. That’s what making me angry. I’m at my most active age, you know? What do you and Darkness find so fun about teasing an innocent virgin guy like me? You should know that it’s really painful for a guy to get into that kind of mood only for nothing to happen.
Er, well, personally, I just wanted to convey my feelings and deepen our relationship. I didn’t know that it would cause you pain. I-I apologize for that…
If you understand that, then leave. All thanks to you saying such strange things, the character that Aqua treats like her son ended up dying. If I don’t hurry up and make it back to where she was by tonight, she’ll start screeching tomorrow morning.
No, wait a second, I really have important things to say to you tonight, please don’t chase me away! Actually, if you keep treating me as less important than a game, I will really become angry!
What? I don’t really care about sleeping together or spending the night together anymore. I’d get all flustered and excited, and it’d end up being little more than a prolonged mental torture session for a young man like me. I’d rather sleep alone than be blue-balled at the last moment again.
…Sure, it’s my fault to leave you hanging after getting your hopes up, but I really didn’t expect you to make such a big fuss over it… No, okay, let’s put aside the issue of sleeping together for now. Can we just chat for a while?
Well, that’d be kind of a waste, and also be kind of lonely…
You really are troublesome, Kazuma! Anyway, I’m letting myself in!
Hey, cut it out! Why are you blushing like that? If you have something to say, then just spit it out! Why do you people keep insisting on doing things that are bad for my heart? It really makes me feel really uncomfortable, you know!?
H-hold on, don’t rush me like that! We gotta start with small talk, don’t we? There’s a lot we can talk about. Let’s not rush things, we can start with a normal conversation and go from there!
What are you playing at!? Coming to another person’s bedroom this late at night, then asking to make small talk with them!?
Er-Oh, right! What actually happened between you and Iris? Even though we didn’t bother clearing it up because of Komekko’s arrival, I’m still really concerned about what made you throw us aside to stay at the capital.
That’s just, you know, the person I’ve always regarded as my sister, Iris, cried and hung on to me and just won’t let me leave. She even said ‘I like onii-chan so much’ with teary eyes, and stuff like ‘I love onii-chan’ and ‘Iris will die if onii-chan doesn’t stay at the capital’, so even someone as heartless as me was touched.
Why is this man still so weak willed? Also, did she really say things like loving you and dying if you didn’t stay?
AAHHHHHHH, CRAAAAAAP!
Wh-why are you doing all of a sudden? Don’t make such loud noises this late at night!! What if someone comes to check!?
No, Iris! I forgot about Iris! Before I was force-fed the memory wiping potion, Iris told me to write her a letter when I remembered her. She said she’ll keep waiting!
Hold on a moment.
What is it? I remembered something important thanks to your small talk. It’s urgent, so don’t get in my way.
There’s literally a young girl in your bedroom right now, and you’re writing a letter to another girl right in front of her? You really are amazing, aren’t you? By the way, um…
Do you still remember what I said last night?
The thing about being between friends and lovers?
Indeed, that. My wish to be more than friends but less than lovers. I’ve come to hear your answer tonight.
Was that supposed to be a confession last night? When I saw you leave without hearing what I had to say, I thought you were just up to your usual temptress tricks and setting me up to be blue-balled again.
Just what kind of girl do you see me as, Kazuma? I’d never play with anyone’s emotions like that!
So, what’s your answer?
Hey, you’re too close! Your face is too close—Eh, wait, so, I were to say ‘let’s go out’, would be officially be in a relationship? In the first place, what exactly did you mean by ‘more than friends but less than lovers’? Wouldn’t we be better off as a straight-up, ordinary couple? Why do we have to be so fuzzy about that? Isn’t it the most important bit!?
No, if we were to just straight up become lovers, well, think about it, wouldn’t we have trouble knowing how to act in front of everyone? Rather than just charge straight into this, I think we should take this more slowly, step-by-step, inch-by-inch…
Why are you acting like such a maiden? You’re giving me goosebumps, stop!
I am a maiden! Be it in age or otherwise, I’m a proper maiden! Just how have you been seeing me up till now!?
…Could you be getting a little desperate? I don’t think it’s very likely, but you’re not developing some kind of yandere complex towards Iris, are you? Calm down and think about it, even I’m not trashy enough to make moves on such a young girl.
You have quite the gall to say that after abandoning us to stay at the capital. Yeah, I am getting desperate. I’m only able to say this right now because I am calm. When you first told us that you weren’t coming back, I nearly burst into tears. I can’t say this enough, please don’t make me worry like that.
And I’m very well aware that I’m a crappy Archwizard. So if a more sensible and more powerful girl who shares much of my traits were to show up…!
I-I get it! I was in the wrong! That was all my fault, so I apologize! I’m sorry!
So, do you or do you not wish to become more than friends but less than lovers with me?
When you say ‘between friends but less than a couple’, how far can we go? Think about it, isn’t it too broad? You get what I mean?
I know, I know, alright? Come to think of it, we haven’t really done that sort of thing yet, have we? Very well, let’s do it then. It’s too late tonight, so how about tomorrow morning?
Wait, isn’t that sort of thing usually done late at night?
…Hold on Kazuma, I think we’re thinking about different things. What exactly are you asking about? I think we’ve had a similar problem in the past before, so why don’t we say what we are thinking at the count of three?.
Make children.
Go on a date.
Hey.
Yeah, we haven’t gone on a proper date yet. It would be problematic if we were to skip that step and went straight to lovers…
Making babies!? Well alright, not that I’m agreeing with what mom said yesterday, but as long as you are willing to take responsibility… Being forced into getting married due to me being pregnant does indeed sound more fitting for us…
…Hearing the term ‘wedding’ makes me a little anxious. I wonder why…
Wait a second, when you tried to cross that line with me in that hotel room awhile ago, didn’t you say that you loved me too!?
That and this is completely different. Because of what you told me, various issues kept me awake last night, so after playing with Sylphina, I went out and paid a special fee for a nap.
What do naps have to do with you said just now? I don’t follow at all!
Megumin, how old are you this year? You’re about to turn 15, right? So I think that, rather than a ‘make children, get married’ approach, we should start with more regular interactions. Let’s properly think about this, both of us haven’t even gone on a date before, right? So if we were to suddenly have children and have a sudden wedding, it’d end terribly for both us and our offspring.
You were the one who brought up babymaking in the first place!
No, wait, seriously, think about it. Now that I think about it, we still don’t know very much about each other, do we? Come on, Megumin, didn’t you keep saying that you are a proper adult? I love you, so let’s make babies and get married isn’t a very mature idea by any standard.
That’s only because you brought it up! Really, what’s wrong with you? Weren’t you all for this, Kazuma!? You’re strange enough already, but today you’re particularly…!
What should I do with this man …? Acting distant the moment the topic switches away from sex. I didn’t expect you to be this far gone… After going that far with me, after all those things you did with me to advance our relationship to such a heated level, was that all so you could have sex!? How could you turn ice cold as soon as your hopes of reproducing are crushed…!
Hey, hold it, you! We have merely bathed together, slept together and hugged. Don’t put it like that! If you’re going to describe it that, then why don’t I actually do something worthy of being treated like such
If you are going to keep talking about meaningless stuff like that, then I’m prepared to do what I must.
You always were this kind of person, weren’t you? Even knowing that, I still can’t bring myself to hate you. Just how simple a woman could I be…
looking at trash
looking at a suspicious item.
Er, well… Since the atmosphere for confessing is long gone, what should we do from now?
Hey Megumin, since we’ve some free time, why don’t we pack a lunch, find a pretty lake somewhere and make some waves with explosion?
Hey, hey Megumin, this is bad! I might actually be in love with you!
You’re trash! You really are trash! Totally, absolutely, completely trash! ‘Might actually be in love with me’!? Was that supposed to be a confession!? Couldn’t you pick your words a little more carefully!?
…Sigh. You really are someone who always messes up when it matters the most. Really… Well, I did say that I like that unpredictable side of yours, so I can’t get angry even if I wanted to…
…So, what should we do in the future? Well… Uh… About our relationship… After today…
Wh-what should we do? Well, to be honest, I’ve never experienced something this amazing in my life. If you suddenly ask me about what to do when dating a girl, I wouldn’t have a clue. So, if our relationship is really that which is more than friends but lesser than lovers, I guess I wouldn’t need to get all panicky. I’m honestly overjoyed. You might have some strange quirks, but you still are a beautiful girl after all… So um, I’d say… a relationship like that is…alright…-ish?
…O-okay then… Let’s leave it at that for now……P-plus, this way, it wouldn’t be too awkward for the others…
Right, then, before we officially become lovers, it would be best to keep this a secret from Aqua and Darkness… And obviously, for the sake of keeping it discreet, we should put off any mature activities for now…
Eh?
Give him back! The Schneider that I carefully groomed and raised… return him to me, you shitty NEET!!
I made it back to where you were before, so give it a rest already! I can’t help it if he’s dead! Schneider has gone to another world and is doing just fine. Who knows, he might even have defeated the Demon King and be having a parade thrown in his honour right now.
… Really? Is Schneider really doing fine in another world?
Yeah, he is, he has built up a harem of beautiful girls and is living quite happily, so don’t worry about him.
Good morning. Isn’t it awfully early for both of you to be up?
Yeah, I took Darkness and her kid out to play with Zell today. I think it’s the first time her kid has fed a dragon. It was really cute seeing her be that tense.
Speaking of, I don’t see her around. Where did Sylphina go?
Darkness took her out to town, saying that she wanted to have Sylphina play with children her own age.
Is that so. I hope that girl gets used to Axel quickly.
By the way, I know Megumin usually gets up pretty early, but why are you up this early as well, Kazuma-san?
Actually, Megumin seems to have gotten up earlier than usual too…
W-what are you saying?! I always wake up around this time! You just think that because both you and Kazuma usually wake up late! Plus, today’s weather is excellent for explosions. Of course I would wake up early!
Ohoh… I see, so that’s what’s going on with you two.
W-What? What do you mean by that, Aqua?
You better wipe that stupid grin of your face, otherwise I will do it for you!
The both of you woke up early to eat the leftover frog steak from yesterday’s dinner, right? Well, too bad, the earliest riser, that’s right, me, has already eaten them!
You did what!? I was saving that on purpose! I was going to use them in the sandwiches I was taking with me today! That’s why I properly prepared them last night! Why are you always causing trouble for me?
What? I already ate them, so I can’t do anything about that! What are you getting so angry for? If you want sandwiches, I’ll gladly help you make more.
Anyway, where are you guys going with said sandwiches? If you two are going out to play, I want to come too.
EXPLOOOOOOOOOOSION!
Today’s explosion scores ninety-five points! Not only is it potent, but the mist created by the blast makes the morning air more refreshing, and even adds a rainbow garnish over the whole performance. The only thing lacking is practical application. If there were any, it would be worth more points.
There is only so much practicality it can have without an appropriate monster to target. This is still the highest score I’ve received in quite some time, so I think today will be a good day!
Hey, hold on, that explosion killed quite a fair amount of fish. Let’s grab those guys and grill them. The number of frog steak sandwiches is lower than I expected, but we can quite easily grill those fish as a replacement. Nice, great job Megumin!
That-That means…
Today’s explosion is worth ninety-eight points!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you very much!!
Pardon me, Aqua!? What do you mean by stupid?! This is an extremely important step in order to build up my repertoire as an Explosion Connoisseur.
Yeah, Aqua! Recently, the score I get from the explosion will even influence my mood, health, and various other factors for the rest of the day. Explosion isn’t a game!
I don’t understand and I don’t want to understand, but I get it. It’s one of those things that I’m better off not getting myself involved in.
Hey, Megumin, this is a date, right?
I don’t know. I don’t exactly know a whole lot about dating either… Packing a lunch, going to a beautiful place with someone you like and doing something you enjoy together… Is that not what a date is?
These sandwiches are really delicious. Hey, do you want to take a nap after eating the grilled fish? Ah, this really is a good day for a picnic. We should invite Darkness and that Sylphina girl to join us next time.
Hey, you guys are adventurers, right? There was an emergency call earlier. Shouldn’t you hurry to the guild hall?
Alright, adventurers, please line up here. This is an emergency. It’s an emergency summon. Sorry to trouble you all.
Hey, something’s off. Should we run away? My sixth sense is telling me that it’s best to get away from here as fast as possible.
What a coincidence, Kazuma. I’ve a bad feeling too. It’s probably my goddess intuition.
The two of you should relax. If you don’t break the law, nothing bad will happen to you, so just relax.
Do you know what kind of emergency this is?
I have an urgent request for everyone. Indeed, it’s an emergency quest. For there is only a month till the end of the fiscal year. Yes, today is the last day that people can pay their taxes.
Some of you adventurers gathered here have yet to pay their taxes.
W-W-What is going on? What the hell is going on? Hey, Aqua, just what is-
C-C-Calm down. Calm down, Kazuma. Just calm down. I’m sure there must be some kind of mistake!
It’s true, we’ve never raised such a matter with you all before. Of course we wouldn’t, adventurers in general tend to be in rough financial straits. As such, thus far we have exempted you… No, allowed you not to pay taxes out consideration for your economic status.
The adventurer’s guild is of course supported through tax money. Naturally, this includes the reward money given out for dealing with monsters. However, just because they are earned by killing monsters doesn’t mean that they should be exempt from taxes. We’ve simply not been collecting them out of understanding for your financial situation. But everyone present should have earned quite a bit this year… yes, the reward for taking down the Kowloon Hydra… Thus far, you’ve all been allowed not to pay taxes due to the compassion of the state. But surely, after collecting such a large sum of money, you should fulfill your obligation to the state, no?
Umm, just how much will be taken as taxes?
All adventurers who earned more than ten million this year shall be taxed half their total income–
Aqua, what should we do? What the hell do they mean by half? How many hundreds of millions do I have to pay in taxes?
I have no money left! I spent it all! You still have to pay taxes even if you are bankrupt! I don’t want to be in debt again! Let’s run! Let’s run far, far away, Kazuma! The tax laws in this world are very simple, everyone has to pay taxes in the first month of autumn. The income of the entire year up till then will be tabulated, and that amount must be paid by the end of the first month of autumn.
It really is easy to understand. Speaking of, isn’t today the last day of the first month of autumn? Then what happens if we run? What happens if we don’t pay it off by today?
The taxes will be waived! The taxes will be waived once office hours are over on the last day.
Will that really be fine? They won’t hound us to pay up?
What are you saying?
All the laws in this world are made by aristocrats. Of course they would implement laws that favour them. For low income civilians, it’d be cheaper for them to just simply pay the taxes rather than taking a vacation to avoid it, so most people will simply pay up. However, the wealthy and the nobility would take a vacation around this time and will only return at the start of the next month.
Just how greedy are these aristocrats!? How cheap! I want to do that too!
W-Wait, there are some kind-hearted people amongst the aristocrats too, don’t just lump them all together…
What are you holding?
Oh this? You use it like so… 
What are you doing?
Megumin-san, yes? Let’s see… your personal earnings aren’t very high this year, so you need not pay taxes. Thank you for your cooperation!
What are you doing?
Paying taxes is the duty of citizens. Now, come on, let us go, Mr Biggest-Earner-in-this-Town.
L-Let me go! Dammit! You bastard… You bastard!
Hahahaha, aren’t we close friends? You shouldn’t be so harsh. Come on, let’s go. You too, Aqua.
NOOO! Please, Darkness, let me go! Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san! Please do something!
Hey, Aqua, cast your buff magic on us! The ones that boosts strength and speed! If you cast it on us we’ll be able to lift her up and drag her along with us! We can easily carry her if we work together!
Mu…
… Aqua, I’ll let you go. You may flee as you wish. There are already watchmen posted all throughout the town, but if you can avoid getting caught by them, you may do as you will. But, in exchange for letting you go, you must not cast any sort of status boosting magic on this man.
Ah, you underhanded bastard! Hey, Aqua, this is just a trick to divide us! Don’t listen to her, hurry up and buff me!
… So-sorry, Kazuma, I think my chances of escaping will be higher if there’s someone else to occupy them… Plus, if you were to escape, the second richest adventurer in this town will probably be me. If that were to happen, the number of tax collectors chasing after me would increase…
Okay, I got it, Aqua. If you buff me, I’ll tell you a method that’s guaranteed to let you safely escape on your own. What do you think of that?
… Just a while ago, you abandoned us to live a luxurious life at the capital. Do you really expect me to just trust you now?
O-Okay, fine, I’ll tell you that method right now. If you think it’s workable, then just buff my strength or speed, either one would do. Just buff me!
I… Okay, fine, tell me what to do.
Kazuma, let’s meet up at the mansion if we both manage to escape. I’ll buff both your strength and speed!
I don’t know what you told her, but she sure seems quite confident in her chances.
You sure are relaxed, aren’t you? I won’t lose to you in strength after being buffed. I’m going to drain your magic until you pass out, then pick you up like a piece of luggage and run off.
Save those words for when you actually manage to lift me up.
U-umm, Darkness-san? Doing something like this in public is… making me j-just a little nervous…
D-Don’t say that, you’ll make me nervous too…
Why aren’t you moving at all?
Ha, this operation has been in the works for quite some time. I originally intended for it to take place at the start of this month, but a lot of things have been happening recently… And just when things started to calm down for a bit, you declared that you wouldn’t be returning home. You really gave me a headache back then.
But we managed to make it in time…! Plus, from the moment we started planning this operation, I knew that you would try and escape. It’s my job to nail down such high income adventurers like you. In preparation for this day-!
In preparation for this day… ! You-you didn’t deliberately fatten yourself for this, did you!? I know you were worried about how well-defined your abs were, but I didn’t expect you deliberately add more flab to—!?
I’m wearing weights! Look! I tied a ton of weights to myself under my clothes! See! Do you see them!?
D-Damnit! Guild lady, I thought you were on our side!
I’m sorry, but I’m also a civil servant. We won’t get our summer bonus if we don’t do this. I’m very sorry!
Dammit, why did you come up with such a convoluted scheme? At this point you might as well just barge into the houses of rich folks and start taking anything that looks valuable!
No, I can’t do that. People would buy volatile explosive potions, put them in places where tax collectors are likely to search and bait them into setting them off. Then after the potions detonate, they would sue the tax collectors for property damage and demand a large amount of compensation…
… It doesn’t seem like you have any intention of moving. Is there really no room for discussion? Knowing your personality, a bribe probably wouldn’t convince you.
Don’t be silly, Kazuma. The Dustiness house will not make allowances for anyone nor tolerate any form of corruption. Just give it up—
STEAL!
… Hey, Kazuma, your Steal has a high chance of targeting a lady’s underwear. Let’s not do something like that in front of so many people. Cease your resistance and just pay the tax—
STEAL!
… Are you serious?
Yeah, I am. I’ll make you lighter by any means possible, even if I end up stripping you naked, then after that I’ll lift you up and run away.
Ah, High-Earner Satou Kazuma-san, yes? Please come with me… Ah, he ran away! Even Lady Dustiness who was responsible for his capture is running away!?
Aah, I ran away… I ran away to protect my own modesty… Even though it’s my job to make sure this guy pays his taxes even at the cost of my life…
Hey, stop moping around and let’s go! I can’t believe you tossed away the key to the handcuffs in the mansion’s yard before you left! Are you an idiot? We’re heading out of town.
… I’m well aware of your high luck. If I had the key on me, I get the feeling that you’ll easily be able to steal it… Anyway, there’s already people posted at the gates, so you should give up on that plan. Why don’t you just stop struggling? I think you are much more manly now that you are rich than when you were being ridden with debts.
Shut up, I don’t need to hear that from you!
Ha…
Hey, aren’t you the iron lady who’s so proud of her own stamina? There’s no way you could be worn out after just running such a short distance, stop messing around and stand up.
Who are you calling an iron lady? … Lalatina-sama is a dainty lady. She can’t walk anymore. Hmph!
… I’ll stand up and run properly. So pull hard on my chain again, just like you’re planning to drag me off… When the cuff bites into my wrist…
E-Even at a time like this, you…
I found them! Over there! Lady Dustiness has him restrained! That man is the perverted brute of Axel! Send for more people! Don’t let him escape!
Ah, dammit! Let’s go Darkness! Don’t you dare hold me back! If you start doing anything funny, I’ll use Steal on you!
… Ka-Kazuma, after imagining you exposing me in front of such a large crowd, I’m starting to feel like it might not be a bad experience. Am I really hopeless?
Yes, you are! You’ve been hopeless since the day we met!
… You sly bastard…
I’ll be happier if you just honestly told me that I’m smart.
You bastard! How could you use such underhanded means? Normally people would just think of a way to escape from the town… What should I do? If word of this gets out, the other nobles will end up resorting to the same thing when they are unable to escape in time.
That’s a problem for the state… In the first place, you should’ve just used your position to push through some new laws to patch these loopholes. That would’ve solved things handily.
Different departments of the government don’t get along with each other. This is a given no matter what country you go to.
You sly bastard! You sly bastard! Damn you!
Uuu… How could those policemen be so hard headed… They are funded through tax money too… They happily handed over the handcuffs when I asked for them, so why are they so inflexible now…? And you! Just the other day, you called the police on Aqua in order to get back into the house, and now you’re purposefully committing a petty crime in order to escape the tax collectors! Just what are you…!
Ah, it’s really fortunate that I’m chained together with you. Thanks to you, it seems like we’ll be able to return home by tonight.
Shut up!
Get out, you’re getting released. I’ll be sending you home… My apologies for troubling Lady Dustiness so. Please, come this way.
I’m home… What, you didn’t manage to escape, Aqua?
Ah, welcome back, Kazuma. No, it seemed like she managed to avoid capture until the time limit, but…
Uuu… uu… I did as Kazuma suggested and headed for the water purification plant… but I got discovered on the way there… I had no choice but to jump into the small pool they use for agriculture… Then… Then!
From what I’ve heard, the tax collectors tried to force her out by bombarding the pool with fire magic to boil her out. Fortunately, the sun set before they managed to do so, but Aqua seems to be really shaken by it. She’s been crying non stop…
… Oh? You still haven’t unlocked that handcuff connecting the both of you?
To prevent a criminal from easily freeing themselves if they get their hands on a key, each set of handcuffs has a unique key… And the key to this one is…
Somewhere out in the yard because of this idiot. She didn’t want me to be able to easily steal it, and she doesn’t remember where she threw the key. When it’s this dark out, even with my night vision, there’s no way I would be able to find a small key hidden somewhere out in the middle of the yard. There’s no choice but to wait til tomorrow morning and get her to look for it.
… Oh, does that mean that the two of you will have to take a bath together, go to the toilet together, and sleep together tonight? How nice.
Kazuma-san, could you pass the soy sauce?
Ah, sure…
Ah!
Ah, sorry…
N-no, it’s fine…
Thanks.
…I-I’m full…
…What are the two are you so nervous for? We’ve known each other for quite some time, haven’t we? After becoming such close friends, what’s the big deal with sleeping together? If you are worried about being alone, Aqua and I can join you as well. It’d be good to have all four of us sleeping together, wouldn’t it?
P-Please do…
…Hey, as a woman, it’s acceptable for me to want Megumin to accompany me… but what excuse would a man like you have for wanting the same thing? At the end of the day, I’m still a lady, so hearing that doesn’t sit well with me.
No, I know there’s no way I could get anything out of sleeping with you. I too would like Megumin and Aqua to be around to avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings. Knowing your personality, you’ll probably end up hugging me in your sleep and I’ll end up waking up with broken ribs.
W-What are you saying!? What kind of world would a person capable of doing that in her sleep even exist in?
Oh, speaking of which, I think this would be the first time the four of us spent the night in the same room in this mansion. How about I entertain you all with some ghost stories before we go to bed?
N-no, I think I’ll pass on that…
Y-Yeah, this place used to be haunted, you know? It’s best not to talk about ghost stories in a place like this.
Seriously, you call yourselves adventures yet you’re scared of a few ghost stories? It’s no wonder we’ve been receiving petitions about adventurers becoming cowards lately. I really wish you guys would straighten up.
…Come to think of it, you’ve been saying that the adventurers have all gotten lazy recently… And petitions? Oh yeah, your house is currently ruling over this town, right?
I’m sure you’re aware of the situation. Now that the adventurers in this town have gotten rich, they’ve become unwilling to take on quests. We’ve managed to clear the quests that were piled up somehow, but they won’t change their behaviour that easily. Even now, the number of monsters close to the town have been steadily increasing. But with this, everyone will want to work a little harder-
Wait, hold on. Are you saying that this situation is because all the adventurers in this town became NEETs? Then, the reason that this emergency summon is the first time any of us heard about having to pay taxes after being exempted for so long is because…
Seems like you understand. It’d be a different story if they continued to protect the town as they did before, but there’s no need to extend any special considerations to a bunch of NEETs. This special operation is to both raise funds and deal with the NEETs in this town. The guild workers should be quite pleased with this. We’ve managed to increase tax revenue, and we’ve also lit a fire under the adventurers who’ve been living a leisurely lifestyle. I’m sure the population of monsters around the town will decrease from now on. But don’t worry, the money we got from the adventurers will all be used on the adventurers—
Hold on a minute!
What, are you saying that I got chased around the town for half a day for such a stupid reason? To kick all these newly rich and lazy adventurers back into gear?
Nonsense! What do you mean by stupid? Labour and taxes are the duty of the citizens in this country! What’s wrong with collecting the taxes that we are owed from people who refuse to work? This country does not need NEETs! Those who can work but refuse to should be thrown out with the garbage!
There’s a party member denying the life I’ve led up till this point!
… It doesn’t seem likely for anything to happen between you two, so I think I’ll let you sleep alone tonight. And while you’re at it, take this chance to bond a little.
Stop fooling around! Japanese need to take a bath every day or they’ll shrivel up and die! I’m not like you fancy bath-hating nobles who would rather try and cover up their body odor with perfumes! If you understand that, then stop getting in my way!
Wha-What are you saying! Even us nobles would take a bath every day! Just what country do such bath-hating nobles exist in?! … It’s just, considering our situation, I think it’d be better to forgo a bath and instead wipe our bodies down…
After working up such a sweat running across half the town, I really will die if I don’t take a bath! It’s not like I’m asking you to join me, go ahead and wipe yourself off with a wet towel or something while I soak in the tub.
N-no, taking a bath means you’ll be naked… While I’m wiping myself off in a half-naked state, you’ll be fully naked…
It’s my turn! Magic Card: Swamp Magic. With this, Aqua’s monsters will not be able to take action for three turns.
…Uuu, I can’t do anything again. Pass.
I don’t really mind you seeing my naked body, so it’s fine. In fact, it’d be a reward in some ways, so you need not mind.
I’m saying I mind! What’s with that shameless personality of yours? Why don’t you try considering what I would feel when I see your naked body?
My turn. Magic Card: Explosion. My opponent instantly disintegrates.
Waah! Megumin, you’re really abusing those spell cards! This is the third time I’ve lost without being able to do anything!
… What do I do about this? I can’t remove my shirt while I’m still handcuffed… Let’s just cut it. This shirt is pretty worn out anyway.
… Do you really not care about stripping naked while I’m still next to you?
Aah… It’s like all the troubles I went through today are being washed away. I almost can’t believe this…
… To boldly expose your naked body in front of a young noble maiden… No, there’s really nothing more I can say about your behaviour.
Do you think the adventurers will hate me?
… Who knows? In the first place, nobody knows that this was carried out on your orders, right? Plus they were exempt them from taxes for all this time, so I doubt they’ll end up hating you that much. Then again, I did manage to escape, so maybe I’m not one to say.
… I didn’t want to resort to doing this either. But to be honest, the finances of this country are in a bad enough shape that we have to resort to borrowing money from Elroad. The money that we took from them today will eventually find their way back to them many fold… If the adventurers took their jobs more seriously, I wouldn’t be doing this either…
You say that labour is a duty, but what’s wrong with not working after securing enough money to live comfortably? The work of an adventurer is extremely hazardous, you know? There exist a similar sentiment in my country that taxes and labour is the duty of the citizens, but even then there are a lot of folks like me who choose to become a NEET. Can’t you at least give us the freedom to choose what jobs we want?
I’m surprised your country hasn’t yet fallen to ruin like that… How should I put this, there’s a form of entertainment called manga where you come from, no? I recall you saying something like ‘if you have a talent for art, you can earn a living simply by drawing manga’ every so often… So, say there’s someone who draws manga. Then, suppose he ends up extremely rich by selling his manga. If that person were to say that he doesn’t care about completing his manga now that he has enough money to live comfortably for the rest of his life, wouldn’t that be a problem?
There is a responsibility that comes with every job. This is the town of beginners. In order to help new adventurers find their footing, there are a lot of facilities in this town designed to aid them. They are given special treatment under the expectation that they’ll continue to protect the people and the country. Journeyman and veteran adventurers still keep their responsibilities in mind even if they become rich, but the beginners in this town are a little… I don’t know why, but there’s a strange school of thought that has taken root amongst the adventurers in this town.
And that is?
Ah, for some reasons, stupid sayings like ‘If you work, you lose’ have been really popular amongst the adventurers of this town as of late.
…What’s wrong? Why have you gone silent? Seems like you have an idea of why this happened. So, do you have anything to say? Why don’t you share them with me?
…No, I don’t…
One more round! This will be the last one, so give me one more round!
I don’t want to. It’ll be the same no matter how many times you try. You’re no match for me. So, as promised, I’ll have you do a favour for me, okay?
Well, it’s still early, but let’s go to sleep. That way we can wake up early tomorrow and go hunt for that key. Hopefully we’ll find it before we need to use the bathroom in the morning.
… S-sounds good.
Well, we’re going to bed now. Are you sure you don’t want to join us, Aqua? Megumin?
The two of you can sleep alone tonight. Judging from how you were acting a while ago, it doesn’t seem like any kind of accidents will occur. Actually, it’d be better if you two could improve your relationship to the point where those kinds of accidents might occur. It’s about time you two acted more like adults.
…Don’t you make any moves on me just because you can see my bare sexy chest.
As if I would! You’re the king of sexual harassment. I should be the one worrying about you trying to rub yourself all over me.
G’night.
Hey! What? Are really just gonna go to sleep like that? …Y-you’re… really sleeping?
… What were you trying to do?
!?
…Zzzzzzzz……ZZzzzzzz………
You…! You licked my neck!? You licked my neck and did things to my body while I was asleep, didn’t you!?
N-no! You’re wrong! I didn’t go that far! Really, I didn’t! It’s really not like that!
What do you mean ‘You’re wrong’? Won’t you explain how my neck got wet then!? I know your hormones are raging, but never thought you would try something like this on my defenceless body while I slept…!
Y-you’re being too loud! No…! I really didn’t do anything! Um, I woke up to find my face buried in your neck! Then, my drool inadvertently dripped onto it…! I thought I should wipe it off, but when I see you chained to me with such a defenseless sleeping face… For some reasons, a strong wave of shame and guilt washed over me… then I got increasingly aroused and…!
Wh-why do you sound like you’re a little disappointed…
… I knew you were a huge pervert with an extremely erotic body, but I didn’t expect you to actually try something on me at night. You were also planning on going all the way with me back when you tried to drug me, didn’t you? Maybe I should really start calling you Slutiness.
D-don’t do that…! …Un…Uuu! …M-my heart started racing after being scolded and called a pervert and slut by you… Am I really hopeless…?
You’re worrying about that now? You’ve been hopeless since the day we met.
Well, you are a Lady; you were most likely forbidden from getting close to anyone… From my first impression, you were more stern and quiet; someone who would never lecture me—and of course—would never fight with me. Even though you were lewd and had some strange attributes, the past you still came across as being more mature…
My first impression was that you are a little dishonest, yet diligent; someone who stays away from shady businesses, a reliable, determined and gentle person.
For some reason, I feel like you’re making it sound as if I’m actually a brute of a man who’s no longer diligent, determined or reliable and would readily get involved in shady businesses.
That is exactly what I meant…?
… Say, Kazuma,
?
… Do you like Megumin?
… S-sorry, did I ask something strange?.
Well, there’s no way I can hate her, so, yeah, I do like her. Of course, I like Aqua and you too.
… You’re saying that you like me… not as a lover… but as a friend, right?
Say… you like Megumin… romantically, right?
… I-I don’t know. To be honest, I don’t really understand it myself. However, I definitely don’t dislike her. I guess you could say I like her romantically. Just being with her makes me feel at ease… How should I put this… When I’m with her—for some reason—I just feel like I can relax.
… I see.
Everything’s pretty great as it is.
Packing lunch for everyone as we accompany Megumin on her daily trip to somewhere like a lake as you did this morning. I start arguing with you over pointless matters. Then Aqua suddenly wants to go travel somewhere. Hearing that, you complain while at the same time formulating an itinerary for everyone in your mind…
Then, every now and then, you agree to go on a vacation, yet at the destination, something else would make it all go south…
H-Hey, what’s wrong? Calm down.
… But, if you got together with someone, everything would be different. There’d be no way things will remain like this… Why can’t we just stay like this? Forever like this… To pay back the debt, you use everything you have up your sleeve to raise the money… and encounter some unexpected, powerful enemy in the process, with everyone barely making it out alive in the end… Why can’t just keep things as they are?
You want a lover, right? …Does that really have to be Megumin?
N-no… it’s not that I want a lover…
If you simply want a woman to screw… Can’t I be that woman? I can go along with anything you wish, no matter what it is, I’ll endure it.
Are you making fun of me? I can get mad too, you know? It’s not like that, it’s… um…
… You’re really acting weird today. Really, what’s wrong? Come on, let’s just go to sleep. Sleep, and we can deal with this tomorrow…
…Uuuu-
Why can’t I work…? Wh-why can’t I w-work …?
… Well, that was unsightly.
… Back then, I was already taken by that Lord. But you saved me from his clutches. You saved me and gave me freedom… So now all I wish is to be able to protect you, to provide you a blissful life. As long as everyone can live on like this, I’m satis…
So you would sacrifice yourself? Are you stupid? It’s the same thing you tried with Alderp! Don’t just solve every problem by sacrificing yourself! Don’t misjudge me, Darkness! I’m not someone who seeks a lover just to do those things, nor am I the kind of person who’s fine with anyone as long as they are willing to become my lover… Um… Megumin confessed to me a quite while ago. Ever since then I, slowly, without me noticing… started to pay more and more attention to her. Eventually, I thought… ah, so I love Megumin too… It’s something I only recently realized… 
… I also…
… I like you too.
… At first, I simply had the hunch that you were the type of guy I’d like… You… being average-looking, perverted, and seeming to be the kind of trash who only wants a lazy life without doing anything of value. Reluctant to work, and drinking from dawn to midnight, and eventually coming down with a mountain of debt… hehe.
Don’t forget that you played a part in landing me into debt too.
Then, should I pay back those debts with my body?
Sorry, I’ll never say things like that again, sorry.
… Every time I see you face against all kinds of powerful enemies and come out victorious, it always makes me feel energetic and refreshed. That magic sword user who was stronger and more experienced than you. The Demon Generals who were stronger than you by orders of magnitude. If I start counting the number of times you’ve exceeded my expectations, it’ll never end… When you tossed money at that corrupt Lord’s face, I became truly obsessed with you.
… You might have been hopeless initially, but you changed quickly. No matter who what enemy you faced, you, who has the weakest job, with no particularly powerful equipment to back you up. With just a basic bow and a strangely named sword, yet with just these you were able to overcome any obstacle, no matter how impossible they seemed. Then, before we realized it, you’ve managed to clear that astronomical debt…
I don’t know when it happened, but you eventually slipped outside of my strike zone. Although you have been lazing around doing nothing of importance and drinking all day recently… I don’t know when, but you no longer feel like the sort of trashy man that I liked.
… I like you. At first because you were scummy and I liked scumbags, so it was a perfect fit. However, as time went on… my type shifted to just you. No matter what you turn into, I would always like you.
… I like you… yet you say that you love Megumin. Even then, I still like you… and Megumin. Aqua, too. I feared that the things I just said would destroy the harmony within our party, so I was originally going to keep them to myself, but…
What Megumin’s mother said the other day… Megumin phrased it like this, right? Wanting to become more than friends?
It seems like I’m a weak woman after all. Even though I like Megumin too… It hurts whenever I consider that she might take you away from me.
… Kazuma… Will I… really… not work…?
Darkness, I don’t hate you. Looking back, this is the first time an older girl as beautiful as you has confessed to me.
… I never came close to anything like romance in the country I’m from. Back then, I’ve always felt that I’d probably end up being single forever… that I’d probably never get the chance to chat properly with a girl… And here you are telling me that you like me for who I am. How could I not be happy?
… But… I’m sorry. I already have someone in my heart. I’m not thick-skinned enough that I can go ‘I love you too’ under this circumstance, and I’m not experienced enough to be able to go out with two girls simultaneously. I’m not that trashy of a person. I can’t be with you.
…Thank you for answering me honestly… Sorry for all the trouble.
… Then I’ll be leaving, Kazuma. See you tomorrow… Seems like I still like you after all. You could’ve simply went with the flow and deceived me, yet you still went out of your way to give me a clear answer… 
Gahh!?
… Hey, are you okay…?
… Pffft!
!?
I’m going to kill you! I’ll kill you then myself right after!
Just to get revived by Aqua in the morning, right? I get it! It’s my bad for laughing at you! But I couldn’t really help it. It’s your fault too! How could I not laugh after seeing such a scene play out after a tense moment?
I was really serious! If a woman gathered her courage to confess, no matter how stupid she ends up looking, any man who laughs at her deserves to be killed! …Ah, right, it’s you we are talking about… If anyone would do something like that, it’d be you! Hey, at least let me hit you once!
You… But… Because…! You tried to leave with such a serious face… ! Pffft… Hahaha…!
I am going to kill you!
I-I’m sorry! I understand, I understand! I’m my fault! It’s my fault for laughing at you! Just one punch! Would you forgive me if I took a hit from you!?
… I see. Stand still and close your eyes, then.
Here goes. You’re prepared for this, right?
B-bring it!
… !?
You… You… !
Hey, wh-what’re you doing, Darkness!? Wait! No, this is bad! This is bad in every possible sense!
Don’t you always enjoy calling me Sluttiness or Lewdness? I’m always lewd-this lewd-that…! You’re right, I am lewd! I’ve already made up my mind! Forget about sleeping tonight, I’m playing with you till sunrise!
Alright I get it, please calm down. I-I don’t think losing our first times in this way is a very mature thing to do, so calm down-!?
No, wait, Darkness! Seriously, calm down! Stop, don’t do this-!
I recall that you did this to me back at my home some time ago… Seems like the tables have turned tonight… !
…? …Ah?
D-don’t do it! Don’t do this, Darkness! Damn, how could this… ! Having only the weakest class, I can’t possibly match the strength of a Crusader like you…!
Hey, Darkness, my right hand! My right hand is free! If you don’t restrain my right hand with your left soon, I’ll retaliate! Be mindful, I have Drain Touch!
Eh? Ah…!
… Hey, what happened, Darkness? Why did you stop?
Idiot, what’s that mouth of yours for!? I’m already half-naked! I’m totally defenceless against whatever you can do with your mouth right now!
Ah! R-right…
Dammit, how could you tease me like this? Your name really checks out, Lewdness! But I’ll never surrender to you! But please stop hesitating and get on with it!
A-alright! Then… here I come… !
Ah, wait a second! It’s getting too cramped down there, so please unbuckle my belt! Remember, you have to say ‘You might be saying that you don’t like it, but your body doesn’t lie…!’ while you’re doing that!
Ah, right, I understand…! You might be saying that you don’t like it, but your body doesn’t lie…!
Idiot, why did you let my hands go free!? Keep holding me down and don’t let me resist!
Ah! S-sorry!
Just like that. Unfortunately, you’ll have to get off my body for a second. Approach me from the side as I’m lying down… Yes, like that. Then, use your right upper arm to press down on my left wrist, and then reach for my right wrist with your hand… That’s it. That way, your left hand is now free, see? Oh, and use your giant breasts to push my chest down so that I can’t get up…!
L-Like this…? Right, then I’ll reach down with my left hand to…!
Ah! Ouch ouch ouch! Why the hell did you tighten it! You’re supposed to unbuckle it! Unbuckle my belt! Also, remember to say ‘Ufufu… that looks pretty painful… !’ while doing so!
A-ah, right! S-sorry for being so clumsy…! Fu… fufu, that looks pretty painful…! So far, I don’t remember hearing you say ‘no’ even once…!
Very nice, that was some great ad-libbing!
Eh? What the?
Hey, hurry up! Go on! Don’t stop now! And remember, your mouth is free while you’re loosening my belt. Consider what your mouth can be doing to my defenceless, naked upper body…!
Save me! This woman is about to violate me!
Ahhhh!?
Man, you guys were really noisy… ! I told you two to get a little closer, not to start a fight in the middle of the night!
Hey, I’m really sleepy. I already worked hard to find the key, so can I go to bed now?
Man, you really are something. Not only did you harass me during my sleep, but you even dared to do such things to me despite my ferocious resistance…!
Ah! You, you bastard…!
… For some reason, I feel like I should kneel before you too.
Well, it’s good that you took the initiative.
Seriously, and here I thought that letting the two of you stay together for the night will bring you a little closer… Darkness, did you tell him everything that you wanted to say?
!?
Why are you apologizing? This isn’t a topic that I have any say in. You should value your own emotions more. After all, we are still not proper lovers yet. It’s not my place to say anything about who this indecisive man decides to go with. So, did you properly get everything off your chest?
Now’s the time to show off how dependable you are. In order to not lose my affection, you should do more cool stuff like monster hunting more often.
Well, I don’t think it’s likely, but just to confirm, nothing happened between you two, right?
No, thanks to this guy’s ferocious resistance, I wasn’t able to do anything.
… Oh, yeah, what was it that Darkness did when I had my eyes closed just now? Was it my first… what do you call it…?
!?
G-good morning, Kazuma. You sure are early today.
I’m not up early. I just couldn’t sleep thanks to what you did last night. Why do you and Megumin keep teasing a teenage boy like me? Raising my hopes only to leave me hanging. Do you actually like me or do you just find it amusing to see me suffer?
Th-That’s… N-No, nevermind. What happened last night was my fault. I wasn’t thinking straight. To think that I had to be comforted by a girl that’s younger than me… I really failed as a noble… Please forget about what happened last night.
How could I ever forget that? Not only was I handcuffed to an older noble lady, I got stripped half-naked and even got my first kiss forcibly stolen. That doesn’t exactly happen often, you know?
That’s not what I was referring to! No, wait, of course I want you to forget about that too!
Why are you raising such a fuss this early in the morning? Are you excited because you spent a night with this man? You can’t lose control of yourself like this, Darkness. I know that you have some strange inclinations, but you should still respect yourself more.
That was too much, Aqua. But guess what, I know full well how things will progress for a man in this situation. From now on, I’ll have a raucous lifestyle where Darkness and Megumin both fight for my attention. Then, when you are left alone, you’ll end up feeling lonely and eventually realize what your true feelings are.
That I should have acted sooner to fix this damn NEET?
No, of course not! You originally only thought of me as a housemate, but after this you’ll slowly realize that you actually have romantic feelings for me. But sorry, Aqua, I just can’t bring myself to see you as a romantic partner. I can only see you in the same way I see Emperor Zell or Chomusuke.
Hey, hold on a minute! Why do you make it sound like I was casually dumped?
Hey, I’ll be coming back late tonight, so you don’t have to make my portion of dinner or wait for me. I’ll be staying over at my father’s place…
Hey, Kazuma, what’s wrong? You look much more slovenly than usual.
You are just as blind as usual. Take a good look. This is the face of a harem owner.
Your bed head is really amazing, isn’t it, Kazuma-san?
If you’re free, do you want to visit the adventurer’s guild? You don’t have any plans today, right?
Don’t make it sound like I have a lot of free time. I plan to take Emperor Zell to defeat monsters outside town today. I’ll have him start defeating monsters from a young age and start accumulating experience points. If we start his education now, he might be able to swallow the entire Demon King’s castle in a single gulp by next year. 
The only way I can see this ending is with you and the chick being swallowed in a single gulp. Anyway, where did Megumin go?
Megumin left early in the morning. She said something about boasting about her victory as a woman to Yunyun.
Oh, yeah, now’s the time where the adventurer’s guild comes in handy. I think I’ll be accompanying you after all, Kazuma. I’ll find some bored looking people to help me raise Emperor Zell’s level.
I really don’t think there’ll be anyone frivolous enough to help a chick grind levels… but alright then, let’s head to the adventurer’s guild.
Giant Frog subjugation quest here! We still need a mage!
We still need two frontliners! Ones clad in metal armour! Is anyone available?!
Seems like several goblins have been spotted in the forest! That’s goblins! The beloved goblins that are worth a lot of money! In order to make sure the newbies aren’t going to get wiped, we’re going with a larger than normal party! Anyone who needs money, feel free to join up!
Anyone who can’t deal with the frogs, want to try dungeon delving with us? We have a policy of avoiding combat and only searching for treasure! People with the thief class are welcome, you’ll be handsomely rewarded!
Hey, what’s going on? Why’s everyone so hardworking? This isn’t like you guys.
Oh, it’s Kazuma. Well, what else could it be? It’s the taxes yesterday. The taxes. Everyone here was caught by the tax collectors and lost half of their hard-earned money. We’re just feeling the pinch from our wallets being suddenly lightened like that.
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, do you think there’d be anyone who’s free to help Emperor Zell gain some levels? Everyone here seems so busy.
That’ll depend on how much you are offering as a reward. Speaking of, do you have a reward prepared?
Well, I have some coupons that can be redeemed at the Axis church for a free confession from me. Do you think that’ll be enough?
They’ll probably just rip it up on the spot, so don’t even try. Everyone’s panicking over not having money, after all.
Hey, isn’t that Kazuma!? I’ve heard from the tax collectors! Lalatina is the mastermind behind this sudden tax collection, right!?
Hey, we were chased around by Darkness too, you know? You’re complaining to the wrong person. In her words, she said she did this to get the lazy adventurers back to work again, and to resolve the country’s financial issues.
Yeah, it’s true that we haven’t been accepting many jobs lately, but even so, didn’t we just recently deal with all the piled up quests…?
She says that it’s to resolve the country’s financial issues, but who knows what she’s actually using that money for? I’ve been hearing rumours, you know? That Lalatina’s been spotted dragging around a young boy and teaching him who knows what.
And now Darkness is looking to become a shotacon too? Just how greedy is that woman?
Hey, Kazuma, isn’t this a good opportunity? Look at the covetous gleam in everyone’s eyes.
Aqua-san, I don’t want to hear that from someone who ended up crying after dropping 100 eris down a drain because she was planning on using that to buy ice cream.
Shut up, you boorish man. If you keep spreading such baseless rumours, I’ll lay a curse on you that will have you waking up each morning to find that the bed is wet… Anyway,
I’ve found Darkness’s actions to be suspicious recently. As her guardian, I feel a need to resolve the issues plaguing her!
I’ve been curious about what she normally gets up to for a long time. Hey, aren’t you guys curious about what she usually does?
Hey, oji-san, is Darkness really here?
Yeah, you can’t mistake it, Aqua-san. Everyone’s seen Darkness here wearing an erotic outfit and grinning as she looks upon the children playing. I’m not lying.
Lalatina-sama, you shouldn’t do this… It’s still way too early for us…
What are you saying? The earlier you learn about it, the better. Plus, you’ll need to know this stuff when you become an adult. So, come on, no need to restrain yourself…
B-But, Latatina-sama…
Fufu, you say that, but you are actually really curious about it, aren’t you? You can go ahead and touch them.
Here, go ahead and touch it. This belongs to you from now on.
B-belongs to…
So, what do you think of it?
It’s firmer than I expected, and it’s so smooth and soft. 
Don’t just touch it, why don’t you try sniffing it too?
Hey, guys, is the door stuck or something? I’m getting sick of standing around out here, so I’m heading on inside.
So, what do you think? A freshly printed book has a really nice smell, doesn’t it? I particularly like the smell of this ink.
I like this smell too, Lalatina-sama…
W-Why are you guys here…?
Hey, Darkness, what are you doing? This seems just like a school.
Y-Yeah, it is. Kazuma mentioned it before, in a certain country, there exists facilities such as this that gives education to children free of charge. The town of Axel has been putting a similar program into action, in order to give the children whose families couldn’t afford private tutors a proper education…
Have you always been doing this kind of stuff?
Hmm, well, I suppose you could say that. By the way, this is the outfit that I normally wear, but I’ve heard that it’s also the uniform of female teachers of a certain country…
My father has been thinking about reforming the education system for quite some time, so we’re funding this experiment in Axel out of the Dustiness family’s own coffers.
To be honest, it’s not something I often show to others, so having you all find out about this is a little embarrassing…
By the way, what did you guys come here for?
So um, you know how we got taxed yesterday? We were concerned about where all that money was going to, so we came here to check things out. Ah, after learning that all my hard earned cash is being used to provide children with an education, I’m now overflowing with the motivation to work. Right, guys?
Yeah, as expected of Lalatina!
The name Lalatina isn’t just for show, I see!
You are really cool, Lalatina!
You’re so cute, Lalatina!
Shut up! Don’t call me Lalatina! Do you guys want to get punched!?
What’s wrong? Please don’t mind us, okay?
Bu-But, I heard that the food and clothes in this orphanage, and these books too were bought using the money earned by these adventurers…
Yeah, that’s right. These adventurers fight monsters day and night in order to protect you, and they even give a portion of the money they earned in order to help people like you who’ve lost their parents. So you need to appreciate those feelings and properly treasure that book…okay?
… Yeah, I understand. Thank you very much, everyone.
I have something to discuss with these adventurers, so please quietly study with your textbooks while we talk.
…I showed an embarrassing side of me…
Say, Darkness, is this orphanage really supported with the money you robbed from us?
What do you mean rob? Don’t make it sound that bad. The tax money that you contributed went into helping adventurers who got injured on the job and retired adventurers. The occupation of an adventurer has always had an uncertain future after all. With this, the adventurers who’ve gotten too old to work will at least be guaranteed enough money to eat.
Is-is that so? But, those children earlier…
The Dustiness house is paying for their upkeep, but, as ashamed as I am to admit it, we’ve had some financial issues as of late. The money we taxed from you was used to shore up that deficit, so that’s why… But don’t misunderstand! I will definitely properly repay it! Several people got injured dealing with the piled up quests the other day, so there’s been some unexpected expenses…
Umm…
So, that’s what I did with the tax money you contributed… Is it acceptable?
Well, we heard that Lalatina was teaching something or the other to children! So, well, after learning that our money was used for something like this, we are very, well, er, you know, right, everyone?
Yeah, of course, it’s Lalatina we are talking about. We’re just worried that she might be trying to quietly shoulder some big burden on her own!
Right? And just like we feared, Lalatina has been pushing herself again! Right?
Aren’t we comrades? The fact that you’re nobility should have nothing to do with this. If you want, we could even escort them on their way to and from school.
No, there hasn’t been any difficulties in particular so far. Just hearing those words is enough, thank you. The safety of the children from regular households as they commute to and from this school is already being handled by a worker of a certain magic item shop.
Still… Hearing you all say that really makes me motivated. Thank you very much. I was sure that you all would still be holding a grudge over what happened yesterday.
What are you talking about, Lalatina!?
Yeah, Lalatina, don’t be so distant!
How could we ever doubt you, Lalatina!
Umm, I’m really happy to hear you all say that, but I really wish you would stop calling me Lalatina…
Hey, isn’t this a little different from what you were saying before? Darkness, I’m telling you, before we came here, Kazuma told everyone-
Hey, what are you doing! Cut it out!
I here thought you were just a perverted noble. I certainly didn’t expect you to be doing such righteous deeds. Why couldn’t you act more like this in your normal life? If you behaved like this, you wouldn’t be unmarriageable and would probably even have a few children by now.
What are you talking about!? I’m not unmarriageable, I just chose not to get married! Had I wanted to, I would have plenty of suitors to choose from!
Oh, speaking of which, Lalatina, I heard that you had a child with Kazuma!
Oh, yeah, that’s right. Congratulations, Lalatina!
Don’t go off and play any strange erotic games on your own now, Lalatina!
But isn’t it great? Lalatina-chan does have some weird inclinations, after all. I always feared that she’ll end up getting abducted by some strange folks.
I was worried that she would happily head off one day to live in some strange monster’s nest. Hearing this puts me at ease.
Kazuma looks to have a pretty secure future. There’s no need to worry about being too poor to afford food if you are with him!
You guys! Even after I took pains to explain everything…! You guys don’t get it at all!
We get it, we get it! Every noble has their secrets, after all. It’s okay if you don’t want to admit it! We know how it feels!
I hope that the joyous day where the two of you officially declare the date of your marriage ceremony isn’t too far off!
You guys don’t understand! You don’t understand at all!
So, seriously, how have things been going, Kazuma? Did something really happen between you two?
It’s Kazuma-san we are talking about. There’s no way that something’s actually happened, right?
Yeah, he’s famous for chickening out at the last moment, after all.
All you folks who are still somehow virgins despite working as a rough and tumble adventurer, you better get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness! Don’t think I’ll always be on your level! I even crossed that line yesterday, right, Darkness?
Idiot! What are you saying! How could you bring up such a topic right now?!
She-She didn’t deny it! You’re kidding, right? Lalatina actually admitted it!
Wait, seriously? Lalatina-chan, did you actually do it? Hey, how far did you go? Please tell onee-san the details!
I thought Aqua-san was just misunderstanding something again when she said that Lalatina had a child…
No! You’re mistaken!
What’s so mistaken about it? You tied me down last night, stripped me half-naked and did those kind of things to me! And that was my first time! Are you seriously calling me a liar?
No, I do think I was in the wrong, but—!
Don’t think that the first time is only important for women! We guys also value our first time highly! It really doesn’t sit well with me to have my first time passed off as some kind of accident!
N-no, that’s not what I…! Sorry, that was my fault! I wasn’t thinking straight back then! So, please, let’s both agree to forget about that, please!
That’s all I will say about this. I’ll leave what actually took place to your imaginations.
You really are…! No, that’s not it, we just—!
Oh, by the way, I saw a girl in there with blonde hair and blue eyes like Lalatina-chan in there earlier. Is she the child you had with him?
You guys, you better cut it…!
—Fuhahahaha! Have you cheeky scamps been studying hard today? Moi have come to fetch you all! Now, all who wish to touch my mask, please properly line up… Hmm, what’s going on here?
Hey, you, what are you doing here? I don’t have time to deal with you right now, so I’ll graciously let you live. Now scram! There’s a deserted alley in that direction, go laugh to your heart’s content over there! As you can see, the children are in peril right now!
Just what is going on? The orphanage has been very peaceful up till now, so how did… Do you not feel at peace unless you bring trouble to everywhere you go?
Don’t make it sound like everything bad that happens is my fault! These children just suddenly collapsed for no reason. You’re a more likely suspect! You didn’t do something to these children, did you?
What are you saying, you bringer of misfortune? As if the ever popular-with-children moi would ever do something like that! The only people who would lay such a curse would be members of the most villainous Axis Cult such as yourself!
But this is really troublesome. To think that they would come down with Colorin disease…
Hey, Vanir, do you know what caused all these children to collapse? What’s with that cutesy sounding Colorin disease?
These cheeky scamps have all contracted Colorin disease… It’s an extremely peculiar disease. It will remain dormant for a time after infecting someone, but once that period of dormancy is over, it will disperse a fast acting toxin into its surroundings just like so. From what my all seeing eyes tell me… That girl over there is the host.
There are two ways to cure this disease.
First off, treating the children apart from the host is quite simple. A constant application of recovery magic and detoxification magic would see them healthy in no time. But…
Detoxification magic would not work on the host. We can only prolong her life using recovery magic while we work on a special antidote.
What’s this antidote!? How do you make it!?
There are five ingredients required to make it. The onion of an onion duck, the root of a mandragora, tears of a ghost, and there’s…
And the last ingredient is… This might be tricky to acquire, but it’s the nails of a high ranking devil.
God Blow!
What do you think you’re doing during an emergency like this!? Now the floor is all covered with dirt! This is no time to fool around!
Yeah, I’m hitting you precisely because it’s an emergency! Ghost tears will be easy to get, we just need to go home and tell a few sob stories. Nevermind that, hurry up and hand over your nails!
Moi is only using a temporary body to inhabit this world. Other than my mask, the rest of my body is made out of dirt.
Right, how about we pay a visit to those girls in that shop? ‘Excuse us, but we need to pry off one or two of your nails.’
You fool. Moi said it needed to be the nail of a ‘high-ranking’ demon, didn’t moi? Those hatchlings wouldn’t even register on the scale.
That leaves us no choice. Very well, it’s time to resort to the demon summoning ritual that have been passed down through the Crimson Demon clan…
Wait, Megumin, that’s a little… Vanir, do you not know any other high-ranking devils? Can’t you do something with those all-seeing eyes of yours?
… Hmm, well, moi does know of a high ranking demon who lives close to this town.
Wh-Where is he!?
You can cast Create Water, so water isn’t an issue, but have you brought enough food with you? What about handkerchiefs and tissues? Hey, Kazuma, do you know how to set up a tent? I’ve heard that some people won’t be able to sleep if they suddenly change pillows, so maybe it’s best that you bring it along with you?
What are you, my mother? You don’t have to worry about us. We’re veteran adventurers, you know? Our levels are pretty high right now. Plus, it’s not that harsh of a journey, so you really don’t have to worry so much. Oh, and I don’t need a pillow.
I can’t help it. I won’t be going with you this time, so take care. If you get killed by a monster, I won’t be able to resurrect you. Don’t pick up and eat anything strange you find, okay?
Aqua, we travelled to both Elroad and Arcanretia, remember? We’re all accustomed to travelling, so relax.
It’s because a sheltered lady who knows little of the outside world like you is traveling alone with a shitty NEET that I’m worried.
Oh, and Darkness, you need to be especially wary while traveling. Take care not to get assaulted.
You don’t have to worry about that. I’m a Crusader, taking attacks from monsters is my job, so don’t worry. I’ll keep Kazuma safe.
What are you talking about? I’m telling to be wary of Kazuma so he doesn’t assault you while you are traveling alone together.
Hey.
Yeah, you should take care not to be attacked.
I don’t think I’ve done anything that would make you suspect that I’d assault a girl… no, wait, I recall grabbing a girl’s hand and some other stuff happening back in the Crimson Demon village, but… no, sorry, it’s nothing.
No, what are you saying? I’m telling you to be careful not to get attacked by Darkness because the two of you will be alone together.
Megumin! Don’t make it sound like I’m some kind of pervert! Just how little trust do you have in… No, nevermind.
What’s this?
That’s the portable toilet that Wiz was selling at a discount at her store. It’s a convenient item when you are traveling, so keep it with you.
In that case, I’ll gratefully accept it… No, wait. Say, Megumin, I know I’ve seen this thing before. If I recall, there’s some kind of flaw in its operation…
It seems like it has a function where it creates a loud noise to mask the sound when you’re doing business. So if either one of you are attacked, please use this to create a commotion and attract attention to yourself.
… Hey, you don’t need that! I wouldn’t think about doing those sort of things while the children are still suffering!
Well, I leave the matter of the devil’s nails in your hands. Aqua and I will do our best to hold down the fort until you return.
I really wanted to meet him and forcibly peel off his nails, but I have to take care of the children, so I’ll just have to bear with it. Hey, Kazuma, you better properly finish him off after getting the ingredients, you hear?
Didn’t you hear what Vanir said? The guy we are dealing with might be a devil, but he’s also a noble of this country, you know?
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san.
What? Do you still have something to say?
It’s a new test product that Wiz is offering in her shop. Apparently this is patterned after something you tried to make before. You can’t tell what will happen while you’re on the road, so take this with you, just in case.
Hey, Darkness, let me take the reins for a bit.
Don’t be stupid. It takes some skill to properly handle a carriage. You need to keep both the speed of the carriage and the stamina of the horses in mind, neither going too fast nor too slow…
The only thing you’ve been doing for a while is holding the reins. Come on, let me try. It’s really boring here.
Okay, fine. Just a little while, alright? Don’t pull on the reins too hard. In general, you can just let the horse handle it.
Don’t whip it! That’s only to be done in the case of an emergency! Really, don’t do it! This isn’t a joke, don’t fool around like you usually do! Do you understand that?
… There’s nothing that looks like a handbrake or steering wheel here. And where’s the clutch?
What are you saying? Don’t just start spouting nonsense!
Relax. It’s just an isekai joke.
What does ‘isekai joke’ even mean…? We’ll be free until we reach the next town, so let’s take this chance to learn more about you. I’ve been curious for quite some time.
So, let’s start with your place of birth.
I come from a country called Japan. It’s one of the leading economic powers in the world, and full of people with black hair and black eyes, like me.
Japan… Japan…
You should have at least heard the name before. Pretty much all of the strangely named folks that you’re familiar with came from Japan.
Yeah, that’s it! All those people with black hair and eyes like yours always seem to possess some amazing power. That Mitsu-something guy with the magic sword was also like this. He had that abnormally powerful weapon… Just how did he get his hands on something like that… The others were like that too. The ones who carved their names into history all basically had features like yours. Then, that means…
… Don’t tell me that you also have some kind of amazing skill or weapon?
I don’t have anything like that. The only thing I have is the high luck I was born with and a slightly above average intelligence, and I suppose just a little bit of bravery and the heart of an adventurer… 
In other words, you’re just a powerless, ordinary man…
Hey, what do you think such an ordinary man like me has achieved! Don’t sigh and look so disappointed! An ordinary man like me having accomplished so much is pretty amazing, you know!? You should be praising me! Shower me me with praise and compliments!
How should I put this, have you changed a little recently? Is it because Aqua has influenced you, or the other way round… Or have you always been like this…
Don’t lump us together. All she does is eat, sleep, and drink, and does stupid things all day. Putting me in the same group as her is…
Isn’t that no different from what you normally do?
Aren’t horses cute? How do I put it, I quite like how they always have such a gentle gaze. I’m fine with cats and chicks, but I think I like horses the best.
Hey, don’t look away. And look into my eyes… Seriously. Anyway, back to the original topic, you told me that you were a ranker in your home country, right?
Hey, why are you looking at me like that!? You mentioned that you were a ranker in your country before, didn’t you? You were given all kinds of nicknames and were looked up to by everyone, and you spent your days hunting with your companions and challenging formidable bosses… 
Well, that did happen, but it’s all in the past now. It’s kind of like an embarrassing history of mine, so it’s best not to bring it up.
Why? What’s so embarrassing about it? Those are the memories you made together with your close friends, aren’t they? Those are all respectable achievements. You should take pride in them.
Or what, do you perhaps find it embarrassing? Even though you constantly boast about defeating how many Demon King Generals?
Hey, Kazuma, I recall you saying that you can’t return to your country anymore… Do you ever feel lonely over not being able to meet your family?
I’ve never once felt lonely since I came over to this world. There wasn’t ever a chance to, what with you guys raising a fuss all the time. Actually, I’ve never even thought of my family until now… Wait, AHHHHH!
W-What’s wrong, Kazuma? Do you sense an enemy?
No, that’s not it! I just remembered! I lent my brother five hundred yen! He said he lacked five hundred yen to buy the equipment he needed for his club, so I lent it to him! He still owes me that money!
Fiv-Five hundred yen? Is that a large amount of money?
Well, if you convert it to the currency used here, I’d say it’d be worth about 500 Eris.
Just write it off! It’s not like you’d miss such a small amount of money. I heard that you tried to bribe Rain off when they were about to throw you out of the castle. Seems like you still haven’t learnt your lesson and caused quite a commotion back there. When I wrote to them to report that you’ve regained your memory, Claire-dono and Rain sent a tearful letter of apology along with several gifts. I felt that they were way too weighty and had them respectfully returned, but…
What do you think you’re doing with tributes meant for another person? I haven’t forgiven them! If I see them again, I’ll definitely make them regret being born a woman. I’ve got some really nice punishments in store for them that would traumatise even you.
…S-Say, about those traumatic punishments, just how far are you going to go? Could you tell me some details…
Shut up! It’s definitely something that even you will hate! Stop blushing!
To think that our travels would progress so well as long as Aqua isn’t around. I wouldn’t mind taking a few more trips like this.
Hey, Kazuma, I don’t think Aqua is deliberately trying to create problems when we travel. Through I do get how you feel after having such a smooth journey… Rather than that, just what are the ‘samurai’ tribe that you mentioned? Can you please go into more detail?
You sure are interested in samurai, huh? Well, it’s just like I said. They wield wickedly sharp swords known as Katana on the battlefield, and they’ll split their bellies at the drop of a hat.
Split their bellies?
Yeah, if they offend their master, they’ll split their bellies. If they lose a battle, they’ll split their bellies. If they surrender, they’ll split their bellies.
Isn’t that a little extreme? If you have to split your belly when you surrender, doesn’t that invalidate the purpose of surrendering in the first place?
Samurai value honor highly, after all. As to how much they value it, they value it enough that they’ll purposefully style their hair in a manner that would invoke fear in their enemies. Then, in battle, they’ll go around collecting the heads of their foes to use as trophies.
Are they some kind of head hunting tribe? But are they not concerned about wiping themselves out? They split their bellies so readily…
What about the others? I want to hear more about the ninjas you mentioned earlier!
Ninjas are primarily active at night. They use the cover of darkness to infiltrate fortresses and take down their prey. Oh, and I also heard that they make use of poison.
Attacking from the cover of darkness, great at breaking into fortresses and poisonous… They really sound scary…
Oh, and in manga and stuff, they can use lighting or fire release or something and breathe fire or lightning in battle.
What? They are capable of using magic breath too?… What else can they do?
The most famous skill they have would be the clone creation technique. They can create countless copies of themselves.
They really do sound scary. I see, are these ninja monsters are hermaphroditic… ?
It’s great that we managed to stumble upon this cave. With this, we don’t have to set up a tent, and we can block the entrance with the carriage after moving the horses to the back of the cave. Looks like we’ll be able to sleep soundly tonight.
Yeah.
We have some jerky and hardtack, so let’s have ourselves a simple dinner with these.
Yeah.
After dinner, let’s lay down a blanket somewhere in the cave and go to sleep. It’s a pity that we can’t have a bath, but we can at least wipe ourselves down.
Yeah.
What’s wrong with you? Are you even listening to me?
Yeah, I am. You want me to use Create Water to make some water for you to wash up, right? Give me a sec, I’ll do it right now.
I didn’t say that… Well, I do want some water, but…
Ah.
N-no, I don’t need any water. I had a bath before setting out this morning, after all!
Oh yeah, I don’t need to wash up either! All I did today was sit on the carriage, so I didn’t sweat too much.
Tough!
Hey, what the hell? I’ve heard that hardtack is tough, but I didn’t expect it to be this tough. How are we even supposed to bite into this?
Why are you asking me that? … Aren’t I a sheltered lady? I know little of the outside world. This is something that you should know.
Salty!
Hey, isn’t it dangerous to eat this? We’ll definitely get hypertension and die if we eat this. Actually, isn’t this just a ball of salt?
Shouldn’t this be used as stock in some kind of stew or something? It certainly looks like it’d be bad for you if you eat it straight up…
H-Hey, Kazuma, where are you going this late at night?
I’m a NEET who grew up in a country of fine cuisine like Japan. There’s no way I could eat this! Especially not after our standard of living has been steadily rising! I have Farsight, Enemy Detection, and Snipe. I can easily bag a rabbit or two. I’ll go out for a short hunt, you stay here and gather up some twigs and branches. If it’s just long enough to cook a meal, making a small fire shouldn’t attract the attention of any monsters.
You really are reliable at times like this…
Kazuma, are you awake… ?
… Kazuma?
Have you fallen asleep…?
It’s fine, Kazuma’s sleeping… Right?
Hey, what are you doing! Why are you making such a racket this late at night?
No, this is, umm, the portable toilet just suddenly started making this kind of noise…!
I see. I was wondering what you were up to when you got up in the middle of the night. So you’ve been holding it in for the entire journey…
Don’t just casually say something like that! And you were awake!?
Of course I am! I’m alone, in the dark, with a woman who’s assaulted me many times before sleeping next to me. Under such circumstances, of course I’d be wary.
Who would do something like that under such circumstances!? Nevermind that, what do we do with this!? I can’t make the toilet stop ringing!
Hey, monsters are starting to gather! They’re being drawn by this noise! Enemy Detection is pinging like crazy! Wake the horses up! I feel bad for waking them in the middle of the night, but we have to go! Grah, I should never have said that things are progressing smoothly just because Aqua isn’t here! You useless piece of trash!
I’m really sorry! I’m sorry for being a useless Crusader!
Please, my name is Dustiness ford Lalatina. I have urgent matters to discuss with your lord, that’s why I’ve made my way here. Please call for him.
Our lord will not see anyone without prior appointments. Even if it is Lady Dustiness, I cannot make an exception…
Please, can’t you do something about that?
E-Even if you say that, those are the rules…
Please, I don’t have much time left!
Now that it’s come to this, I’ll lend a hand. Hey, you guys, this girl is probably going to end up standing there until she meets the lord. It’s going to turn into an endurance contest.
No, I really am in a hurry, so I can’t afford to wait around!
…No, come on, just go along with me. It’s not like you can just force your way inside.
… If you put it that way, then I suppose I can at least send word to the lord…
That’s great, Darkness. With this, we’ve taken the first step—
That won’t do! Please let me see him!
What are you doing? I know that we are in a hurry, but you should put a bit more trust in Megumin and Aqua. Don’t you remember what we came here to do!?
Please, let me use your toilet…
—We ended up embarrassing ourselves thanks to you!
That’s my line! You were the one who raised your voice and attracted a crowd!
I told you to handle it in a secluded spot somewhere. This is why I hate dealing with noble ladies, their pride gets in the way at the strangest times. You still dare call yourself an adventurer?
No, I know that having to deal with business out in the wilderness is unavoidable for an adventurer, but what does that have to do with me being a noble lady…? Ugh, this is the first time I’ve regretted becoming an adventurer.
Thank you for waiting, Dustiness-sama. The lord will see you now.
Hey, Darkness, you mentioned that this noble is a little odd, didn’t you? What do you mean by that? What kind of person is the lord of this castle? Is he a pervert like you?
Just what do you think us nobility are? The ones you’ve met are all a little weird, true, but most nobles are highly respected and an example to the common folk… Er, well, leaving me aside…
The lord of this castle is Count Zereschrute. He’s known as the Lord of Brutality.
Hey, Darkness, maybe we should regroup and come back with some more people…
It’s been some time, Lord Zereschrute. My apologies for the sudden visit, but this is a matter of some urgency…
Lady Dustiness, thank you for making the journey… I’ve heard the details, it seems like you need one of my nails to brew some kind of antidote… And if you are seeking that, am I safe in assuming that you know what I am?
Hey, Darkness, is this man really a noble of this country? You didn’t figure out his true identity until recently, right?
What are you saying, Kazuma? We are currently in the middle of important negotiations, so don’t butt in. My apologies, Lord Zereschrute, this man is Satou Kazuma. He is my escort and also my companion as an adventurer.
I’ve heard about him. He’s said to be an adventurer who has vanquished quite a few generals of the Demon King’s Army. He doesn’t look to be anything special, but they do often say that looks can be deceiving…
Hey, how are you two just conversing normally? Come on, Darkness, isn’t he suspicious as hell? Why is he wearing a penguin suit? Are you saying that this thing is really a noble!? Where should I even begin!?
Hey, say something. What the hell is going on with this country? Not only are people like you and Claire counted as high-ranking nobles, now there’s a guy wearing a penguin costume? Did you ever tried to find out what the guy looks like underneath it?
Do you recognise the magic armour that the Count is wearing? It’s not a costume, it’s a piece of armour from a far away land. It’s durable, flexible, waterproof and retains heat well in winter… In this country, as long as you have the talent, a few peculiarities can be easily overlooked. We require skilled people in order to fight against the enemy of all mankind, the Demon King’s Army.
No, no matter how you put this, this is way too suspicious. The guy inside may very well be a spy for the Demon King’s Army!
Now, now, calm down. You don’t have to worry about that, I have no intentions of helping the Demon King’s Army. You can trust me on that.
Anyone who would honestly trust you after seeing what you look like needs to go see a doctor.
Well, hear me out, young man. If you know my true identity, you must have some basic knowledge about devils, yes? To us devils, humanity is an important partner that we need to coexist with. Please believe me.
The devil Vanir who introduced you to us once mentioned that us humans are machines that create wonderful meals for you devils.
What, you’re acquainted with Vanir-sama? Then that speed things up a little. Indeed, you humans produce wonderful meals for us. The dark emotions and thoughts that you experience are our sustenance. If you understand that, then hurry up and feel some dark emotions, you ill-mannered brat.
My apologies for his rudeness, Lord Zereschrute. We have not shared the fact that you are a devil with the citizens of Axel, and we promise not to speak of your secret to anyone else. So, please…
If I recall, Lady Dustiness is a devout follower of the Eris church, yes? Is it really okay for you to overlook a devil like me? And you are an important figure in this country too. Surely you can’t let a suspicious character like me run free, can you?
In the past, I’m afraid I wouldn’t simply let it go.… However, this man made me realize just what it is that I need to protect. What I should be protecting isn’t the pride of the nobles, but those without power. He taught me what it really means to not let my principles get in my way of what needs to be done, and I believe I’ve become a better politician because of that. And… I need to thank you, Kazuma. If it weren’t for you, I would still be a hard-headed crusader. If it were the past me, I most likely would not have been able to overlook Lord Zereschrute after learning his true identity.
So, what do you think, Lord Zereschrute? Was that a satisfactory answer?
… No, it’s not my intent to hear your motivations… If I recall, Crusaders are able to use holy magic. I was simply worried that it might cause problems if you were to lose your magic by going against the teachings of the Eris church…
Umm… I can’t use magic, so there won’t be any problems on that front… Thank you for your concern…
Well, that’s good then. Oh, those are the feelings of shame that Vanir-sama likes so much. I’m not particularly fond of them myself, so there’s no need to offer such emotions to me.
—Now then, let’s go back to our original topic. You wish to have one of my nails, yes? Unlike greater devils like Vanir-sama whose real body still remains in hell, for a devil who has brought his true body into this world like me, even removing a small portion of my nails causes me great pain.
Regarding that, we don’t have a lot of money on hand currently… but I swear, on the name of the Dustiness family, that I will repay you. It might take some time, but I’ll definitely offer a fitting recompense. So, please…
I’ll prepare the money.
Wha-?
I may not look like much, but I have quite a sizable fortune. And I’ve been doing some forward trading lately as well.
Y-You, since when did you get involved in that? Don’t do it! An amateur can very easily go bankrupt fooling around with that.
You see, Darkness, according to the information I gathered, it seems like a higher than usual amount of snow sprites are predicted to appear this year. That means that this year’s winter will be colder. With that in mind, I targeted crops that will be highly affected by the cold… Furthermore, I even got an expert on such matters to handle it.
No, I’m not concerned about money. I’m sure you are aware of the state of my finances. My territory is prosperous, and I make great contributions in taxes every year. That’s why I’m allowed to hold such a rank despite my appearance… On that front, it could be said that I contribute more to this country than the Dustiness family that’s known for its poverty.
U, uu…
… I see, then, how about using the backing of the Dustiness family to help expand your territory?
Kazuma, what are you saying? Don’t go deciding that on your own!
No, no, I’m quite happy with the lands I currently have. I have no desire to expand my territory at this point.
Hey, Darkness, doesn’t your family outrank him? Can’t you use your authority to strongarm him into giving what we want?
Don’t be stupid! I did say I wouldn’t let my principles get in the way earlier, but even so, there’s no way I’m doing that!
I can hear you, you know?
Hey, we aren’t demanding anything unreasonable like asking you to hand over your fortune or anything. It’s just a mere piece of your nail. Why don’t you just hand it over. Like that, the children will be happy, we will be happy, and you’ll get to keep your identity secret. It’s a win-win with three wins, so just hand it over.
I can’t see that as anything but a threat.
Hahaha, Zereschrute-san, did you know? There’s a fearsome Archpriest of the Axis Cult who would fly into a rampage at the mere sight of a devil in Axel. If she learns that you rejected our request, I wonder what will happen…
Hey, Kazuma, that’s going too far! I can’t tell who’s the actual devil now!
Hahaha, as expected of an acquaintance of Vanir-sama! I didn’t expect there to be a person bold enough to try and intimidate a devil! Truly amusing! Well, I’m not entirely without desires. It’s just that what I want is not wealth or material goods.
Could that be… my body!? You are eying my body, aren’t you!? You want me to offer myself to you in order to save the children! Damn you, Lord Zereschrute! As expected of one with the title of the Lord of Brutality. Fooling everyone with your cute appearance, only to reveal the brute hiding inside…
N-No, that’s not it! Devils have no gender and are have no interest in the bodies of humans. Stop making me sound like some kind of brute!
Then, would you like to accept a little noble’s challenge?
You see, some nobles like to entertain themselves by watching monsters fight and betting on the outcome.
Didn’t the prince bring out a gryphon when we were in Elroad? It’s something of a status symbol for nobles to have powerful monsters on hand.
Fight the monsters that that penguin brings out and show your strength, huh…
The problem is if Darkness can win on her own.
I don’t know what he’s planning, but you need to be careful now that you’re fighting alone. Sure, he says that devils have no gender and aren’t interested in the human body, but who can tell if that’s really the case. Seeing a female knight get roughed up and flung into all sorts of positions is just what a villain would want, so who knows what kind of monster he would bring…
You’re looking forward to that, aren’t you?
…No, not at all.
Welcome to my colosseum. Normally, this place is used to pit monsters that other noblemen bring against each other, but… Today, the main event is you, Lady Dustiness!
Bring it on, Lord Zereschrute! I’m a devout believer of Eris and a Crusader, no matter what kind of monster you bring, I’ll never submit!
As expected of the honourable Lady Dustiness! Well said, very well said! The feelings of shame, humiliation, and anguish that such confident warriors experience when laid low are the kind of emotions that I desire! Now, proud Crusader! Show me what you can do!
Let’s start small. Lady Dustiness, show me how you handle this group of goblins!
This is terrible.
Kuh, to think that I’ll be restrained by goblins…! You little demons, what do you intend to do after immobilizing me!?
Just what’s the meaning of this, Lady Dustiness… You are a great noble of this country, and the one who vanquished many generals of the Demon King’s army. You shouldn’t be having this much trouble with such a small group of goblins… Oh, I see!
I see, so you understand that this is for show. True, if you were to demonstrate your true strength, these goblins would be defeated in a flash. But that wouldn’t make for good entertainment, and thus the point of this exercise would be…
Furthermore, I cannot sense even the slightest hint of humiliation or anguish… I see, I see… So you intend to demonstrate that you can withstand any attack from a monster without having to lift a finger!
I will not sully my blade with the blood of goblins. My sword does not exist to vanquish monsters at your leisure, Lord Zereschrute. It exist to protect this country!
It would seem that mere goblins won’t be able to bring out your true capabilities… Enough, goblins, you may retreat!
Lady Dustiness, I should warn you.
What I’m about to release now can be said to be natural enemy of Crusaders. They might be close to extinct now, but they were once known as female knight killers, princess knight killers, and other such names. Yes, they are a legendary monster indeed.
W-What?
Yes, you should at least know of the name. Monsters that are known as the enemy of all women…
Wait, the enemy of women? Don’t tell me… A demon slime? Or perhaps a roper? No, wait, you said they are extinct… Don’t tell me, you—!
Looks like like you have an idea of what’s coming. The natural enemies of Crusaders, and a monster that was once as common as goblins!
Come forth, pure-blooded male orc! Show us the strength that once struck fear into the hearts of women all over!
How could this be!? They were supposed to be extinct! To think that there are still male orcs left in this world…!
Mwahaha! Now, entertain me! Let me see what it looks like when a pair of lecherous orcs starved of female contact make a proud Crusader submit to them! Let me taste the best emotions of shame!
Dammit, how could this happen? I really want to step in, but if I do, all your previous efforts will be wasted. Hang in there, Darkness! Don’t you dare lose to these orcs!
Why did you move all the way to the front seats? It’s true that having you interfere would be a problem, but hearing you get this excited is also a little…
Go forth, orcs!
Hey, Darkness, what is this? Did you do something to those orcs!? You didn’t buy a bunch of orc children some time ago and did unspeakable things with them, did you?
Who would do such a thing!? Please stop treating me like some kind of slut! Anyway, these guys seem to be afraid of me for some reason.
Hey, penguin, do your job and train them better!
I don’t want to hear that from you! Just what’s going on? Why are the orcs frightened?…  Could it be the divine protection that Crusaders receive? Evil creatures like orcs must be able to sense that and be scared away by it.
Enough, seems like you two won’t be able to deal with her. You may stand down.
What’s wrong, Lord Zereschrute? Weren’t you going to bring me to my knees? Is that all I can expect from the Lord of Brutality!? You disappoint me!
Grr…
Fufufu…Mwahahaha! I underestimated you, Lady Dustiness! It seems like neither goblins nor orcs will get us anywhere. Very well, allow me to handle this personally!
Hey, are you seriously going to fight in that costume? Isn’t it too early to give up? Come on, you still have a few more dangerous monsters, right? If you have orcs in your bestiary, you must have some demon slimes or ropers or something, right!?
Well, it’s true that I may have such monsters at my disposal, but if she’s still resolute even after seeing evil creatures like orcs, I doubt monsters on that level will do much better. After all…  I’ve not sensed even a hint of fear or dread coming from Lady Dustiness.
Wha—!?
Now, show me your power, Lady Dustiness! I’ll bring you to your knees and feast on your delicious dark emotions!
… There’s nothing I can say.
Yeah, really.
… I didn’t expect you and that devil to be so compatible.
… There’s nothing I can say.
Yeah, there really isn’t.
… I didn’t expect you to actually forget that I was there and thoroughly enjoy it…
Hey, don’t make it sound so obscene! That’s a first for me too! To think that he could be hiding something so hideous under that cute exterior…
Well, I did end up seeing something amazing, so I guess it’s fine…
Please forget about it! Ugh, first Vanir and now Lord Zereschrute, I really hate dealing with devils!
It’s good that devils have no gender, otherwise…
Didn’t you say you liked me just a short while ago…?
Hey, Darkness, look at that.
… Really, there’s nothing I can say… Is that Chris? What’s she doing here?
Hey there, your old pal has come to help out.
Assistant-kun, Assistant-kun! Look! There’s a really big inn over there! Shall we stay there tonight?
Big Boss, do you have the money to stay in such a fancy place? I always got the impression that you’re the kind of person who quickly blows away all your money the moment you get it.
Of course not. I donated most of my money to the Eris Church and drank the rest.
That’s no good, Big Boss. Then what are you going to do about tonight?
Oh, Assistant-kun, are we really that distant? Haven’t we ran around the city at night together? We’re already close friends, aren’t we? Such close friends should of course sleep in the same place!
I’ll cover Chris’ lodging fees. You did rush all the way here from Axel to help, after all… Still, Chris, it’s not bad to be so devoted to Eris-sama, but for the sake of your future, you should at least consider saving up some money.
Yay! Thanks, Darkness! Yeah, I’ll think a little more about my future from now on.
You don’t need to thank me. You’re the person I’m most worried about. I have my family estate, Kazuma here has both a mansion and a fortune. Aqua and Megumin can rely on him for their daily fees. But what about you, Chris? You don’t have a fixed home nor do you have any savings. Sure, it’s very adventurer-like, but maybe you should consider moving together with us…
N-No, I’ll be fine, Darkness. I might not look like it, but I have plenty of places to stay, so I can get by somehow.
Tell me how exactly do you plan to ‘get by’!? You’re not planning on breaking the law again, are you? If you get caught, I can’t just let you be. It might be different in the past, but right now I have to use my authority in a just manner. Please don’t make me have to do that.
What happened, Darkness? Why would the hardheaded Darkness say something like that? Hey, it’s your fault, isn’t it? You were the one who led her astray! Give her back! Return my earnest, hardheaded and easily fooled Darkness to me!
Don’t blame me, Big Boss. She’s always been a little shot in the head.
Hey, Big Boss, we should go stake the place out soon. And now that I think about it, we don’t really need a place to stay. There’s a girl who needs the medicine as soon as possible, so we should leave as soon as we are done here.
Uuu, do I have no choice but to be an accomplice to a crime…? Me, personally…
Now, now, Darkness, this is necessary in order to save a girl’s life, right? Then we don’t have a choice. I do feel a little sorry for this Lord Zereschrute guy, but we need those ingredients.
Big Boss, you really do take good care of your flock.
…? I don’t really get it, but thank you?
Anyway, Big Boss, please stop looking around like that. You aren’t a country bumpkin, you know? Plus, your silver hair is really distinctive.
I’ve been curious about it for some time, but when did the two of you get this close to each other? You two even formed some kind of thieving band before I realized it. I don’t recall you having that much contact with each other…
What’s the matter, Darkness? Does the relationship I have with Assistant-kun bother you? Come to think of it, I still haven’t asked how far you got with Assistant-kun, right? I wouldn’t mind answering your question if you are willing to answer mine.
Hey, Assistant-kun, Assistant-kun, Darkness is acting really strange. Just what did you do?
I didn’t do anything. In fact, we are so awkwardbecauseI didn’t do anything. Simply put, Darkness confessed to me, but I rejected her because things have been going well between Megumin and me.
Eeh? You rejected Darkness!?
Big Boss, you’re way too loud! We are awkward enough as it is, so why do you need to say that!?
But… But…!
Assistant-kun, does that mean you’re going out with Megumin?
No, right now we are more than friends, but not yet lovers, I think.
What does that even mean? How far did you go with her? Have you kissed her yet?
I didn’t do anything with Megumin yet…
I’m surprised. I always thought Assistant-kun was more unrestrained, the kind who would eat a girl up if given a chance.
I see, so Darkness still has a chance, right?
No, I’m a pretty faithful man, you know? Even if you try and fan the flames like that…
But you are the surprisingly responsible type, aren’t you? If you cross a line here, you’ll take responsibility, right? Then, if Darkness properly kisses you now, not on the cheek but a proper kiss, then you…
I have already kissed Darkness. On the lips.
Wait, what!? Didn’t you have a thing going on with Megumin!? You haven’t done anything with her, but you have done that with Darkness? What does that mean? I’m still young so I don’t really understand what you adults are saying!
Hey, Darkness, doesn’t that spot look like a good place to stop this carriage? It seems to be pretty secluded.
Yeah, I guess there’s fine.
Hey, don’t just ignore me! Tell me! Hey, Darkness, we’re old pals, right? So tell me exactly what happened that led to you kissing him!
Kazuma, just what are you telling her!? Please don’t ask any more about that, Chris!
Hey, Kazuma, just what are you agonizing over? We have already come this far, so let’s go. The children are suffering as we speak… I’ve already prepared myself mentally, so stop dragging your feet and go.
Okay, Darkness, we are professionals. Regarding such matters, you are a newcomer, so you need to listen to what we professionals say.
Yeah, Darkness, you’re a noble lady, so you aren’t too familiar with such stuff, right? Don’t worry, leave it to Chris-san. After all, Assistant-kun and I were the ones who successfully broke into the royal castle.
Sure, you infiltrated the castle, but didn’t you end up getting chased all over the place?
That’s because Assistant-kun…
Big Boss, now’s not the time to reminiscence about the past. Even as we speak, the children are…
That’s true, but I don’t want to hear it from you!
Big Boss, did you bring a rope?
Of course. Ropes are the best friend of thieves.
Do the two of you normally walk around with those things? No, I suppose you brought them because you knew we’d be sneaking in…
That’s not it, a thief needs to have something like this on hand at all times.
Big Boss, Darkness is a sheltered lady, so what’s common sense for us may not seem like it to her…
Ah, right, sorry, Darkness.
You seem pretty skilled at this.
Damnit, the rope’s too slippery to climb!
Assistant-kun, given the strength of my arms, it’d be pretty difficult to get over this wall.
Big Boss, let’s tie some knots into the ropes. That’ll give us some handholds and make it easier to climb.
Hey, you two, I think I’ll be able to climb up just like that with my strength. Should I go up first and pull you two up?
Hey, Darkness, a newbie like you shouldn’t just say whatever comes to mind.
Yeah, Darkness, a moment of carelessness could cost you your life. You don’t have experience, so it might seem easier than it actually is to you. Just leave it to us.
I-is that so? Sorry, I shouldn’t have interrupted.
Right, then, Darkness, follow behind us.
Big Boss and I both possess the Lurk skill, but you obviously can’t use it, so don’t let go of my hand, okay?
O-Okay!
Right, since you’re my underling for this mission, you can call me Kazuma-senpai.
Kazuma-senpai.
Yeah, just like that.
Darkness, can you say that again?
Ka-Kazuma-senpai.
Hey, Assistant-kun, stop fooling around and let’s go already.
Big Boss, didn’t you ask me to do a similar thing when I first became your underling?
This and that are different matters. Anyway, let’s hurry on, Assistant-kun.
Listen up, newbie. Around this time, the master of the place will most likely be at the higher floors. Most big shots and bosses prefer to live in high places.
No, I’ve visited this castle many times before. Lord Zereschrute should be sleeping close to the arena where the monsters are. Let’s head there first.
Right, Darkness, what we just told you is what to expect in general. Of course, we are aware of where the master of this castle currently is. We have the Enemy Detection skill, after all.
I-is that so? Sorry, I once again said something unnecessary.
No, that’s fine. You’re new to this, so it’s to be expected. And there are times when a newcomer can offer a fresh perspective on things. It’s fine to voice out if you think something amiss. Right, then, let’s head to the basement… Wait, before that…
This is my turn to shine. I’ll have it open in a jiffy with my Lockpicking skill.
Assistant-kun, this is bad! There’s no keyhole on this door!
Are you serious, Big Boss? What should we do now? This isn’t a magic door that can only be opened with a password or something, is it?
No, for these kinds of doors, you need to do this…
It’s a lifting door commonly found in old castles. It’s extremely heavy and requires someone strong enough to lift it in order to enter, so it’s quite efficient at deterring thieves… W-what’s wrong, you two?
Hey Darkness, what would you have done if there was a trap? It’s only because of my high luck that it wasn’t trapped this time, but…
Yeah, Darkness. What were you thinking, just carelessly opening that door like that? It’s only because you’re with the luckiest person in Axel that it isn’t trapped.
S-sorry. I really didn’t think of that.
No, it’s fine. You are new this this, after all. But, maybe you should lead the way from now on.
Yeah, you’re the newbie, but we’ll let you take the lead just for this time. Don’t worry, we professionals will be supporting you from behind.
R-really? If you say it’s okay…
Assistant-kun, Assistant-kun, aren’t we just in the way?
Big Boss, there’ll still be chances for us to shine. At the end of the day, Darkness is still a little bit of an airhead. As pros, we need to properly support her.
Hey, Darkness, monsters are guarding the staircase ahead of us. You won’t be able to hit them, so Big Boss and I will handle them. You keep an eye out for anyone else approaching.
I got it! Let me see what you can do!
Assistant-kun, Assistant-kun! Those are orcs! They are the male orcs that were thought to have been exterminated a long time ago. Is it really okay to kill them?
If possible, I’d really want to avoid killing such noble creatures.
Noble creatures? What’s up with that? … But I get it. I’ll deal with them. You told me those orcs have trouble dealing with women, right? Then I’ll go ahead and use bind on them, Assistant-kun and Darkness, you two keep a lookout. 
Assistant-kun! Help me, Assistant-kun!
That wasn’t what you told me, Assistant-kun! Weren’t these orcs supposed to have trouble dealing with women? Wait, don’t! Stop! Assistant-kun! Darkness! I’m getting stripped!
Uuu… Thank you, just a little more and it would’ve been…
These guys started shivering in fear after seeing Darkness charge in to rescue you, so they are definitely still afraid of women. Is it because Chis resembled a boy that they…
Shh! Don’t say anything more, Kazuma! Come on, Chris, it’s okay now, so let’s get dressed.
Uuu… Darkness… I can’t get married anymore…
Don’t worry, Chris, those are monsters so that didn’t count. They don’t count.
Anyway, thanks to Big Boss’s sacrifice, the path to the basement is open. So, come on, let’s hurry on.
Hey, Assistant-kun, isn’t this castle a little strange? You two mentioned that he’s a nobleman who enjoys keeping monsters, but isn’t it odd for him to let orcs guard his doorways? And I’ve been detecting the presence of monsters wandering all over the place. This really doesn’t feel like they are being kept in cages…
There’s a reason for that, but I’ll leave it for later. Anyway, we should avoid getting into conflicts from here on out.
Even with Enemy Detection telling us their position and Lurk allowing us to hide, I didn’t expect to be able to slip through without fighting a single battle…
Things are progressing smoothly, aren’t they? What do you think, Darkness? This is what happens when Big Boss and I work together.
Right, Assistant-kun, with our high luck, it’s only natural that things will progress like so when the two of us are together.
… But didn’t you run into problems climbing the wall? And when you ran into that door, and when you tried to fight those orcs, and…
Hey, Darkness, don’t say anything more. Everybody makes mistakes. You too have been staying awake at night because letting Sylphina contract that disease on the journey to Axel and spreading that disease to the other children has been eating away at you, right? Yeah, everyone makes mistakes. The question is whether you let those mistakes get you down or you pick yourself up and fix those mistakes like we do.
Yeah, Assistant-kun is right! It doesn’t matter if you make mistakes along the way as long as everything works out in the end. So you shouldn’t let it get you down, Darkness.
You two… Yeah, now’s not the time to wallow in my despair. Bringing back the ingredient comes first…
… Hey, wait a minute. Yeah, I was a little depressed over making such a mistake, but I don’t think that is really relevant to what we were talking about…
Darkness, quiet down. Seems like there’s only a single path ahead. Could it be that the penguin count’s room lies at the end of this hallway?
Yeah, it certainly feels like there’s a boss room ahead. That’s what my intuition as a veteran thief is telling me.
Indeed, Lord Zereschrute’s room should be right ahead… Still, I can’t shake the feeling that you two have been playing tricks on me…
Hey, Assistant-kun, is this really the castle of an evil aristocrat? Between the door and the hallway, I can’t help but feel like this place is more suitable for a general of the Demon King’s Army…
Well, it’s not really accurate to call him an evil aristocrat, but… In any case, if we don’t retrieve a certain item that this lord has in his possession, the life of the girl will be at risk. That hasn’t changed.
It’s just as Kazuma said, Chris. The goal of this mission is bring back the ingredient we need to brew the antidote. Just focus on that, Chris… Really, please, don’t lose your head here.
Hey, what’s wrong? Why are you warning me so many times? Just what’s behind this door?
Welcome, mysterious intruders! I’m sure you are well aware of what this place is! Fufu, you mysterious intruders who I’m meeting for the first time.
Dammit, he knows who we really are!
Hey, Assistant-kun, what do I do? Is this what you were repeatedly warning me about? It’s impossible! There’s no way I’d be able to attack something this cute! Just no way!
Hey, Chris, don’t let your guard down! It may look cute, but there’s something truly horrific hiding inside! Our goal is to get a fragment of his nail! His nail is a vital ingredient in creating the antidote to Colorin disease!
Nails that are used in the creation of the antidote to Colorin disease…
Oh yeah, Chris, use bind to restrain Lord Zereschrute! I’ll block all his fierce attacks with my body!
As expected of the intruder who looks just like a certain shield of this country! Your resolve is admirable indeed! But how long can a mere human withstand my true strength, I wonder…?
AAAAAAH!? Wait, don’t—!
He-Hey, Chris, what are you doing? Just use Bind on him! We just need a piece of his nail, we don’t need to kill him! Actually, no, if you kill him, his body will be sent back to hell. If that were to happen, we won’t be able to retrieve that all important nail fragment that we need.
Hey, Assistant-kun! What are you doing!?
What are you doing!? That’s my line! Don’t forget what we came here for! What we need is his nail!
Oh, right! We need to remove one of his nails before killing him!
What’s with this berserk little kid!?
I’m a woman!
Who cares if you are a guy or a girl! Is that a magic dagger? Or is it a cursed item? I can feel an extremely strong bloodlust towards devils emanating from that dagger! Just touching it causes me to go numb!
I would prefer to say that it has received a divine blessing! This is a powerful dagger specifically enchanted to deal with devils like you!
You crazy girl! Why do you have such a strong hatred for devils?!
Crap, he’s trying to reveal his true body!
I’ll restrain him with Bind! Big Boss, can you cut off the tip of his flippers!?
Don’t worry about me, Kazuma! Restrain him along with me!
Bind!
Y-You little—!
Ah!…Ah!
Assistant-kun, this devil is really disgusting!
It’s best that you don’t see what’s inside, then! It’s far more disgusting!
Darkness, please hang in there for just a while longer. I’ll get his nails-!
AAAAAAAAH! Curse you! Would you stop using that dagger!?
Hey, the only things tentacles are allowed to attack are Crusaders! This has been a rule since ancient times!
Darkness, we have it! The nail of a devil! Assistant-kun, how long do you think your Bind will last?
I-I put my all into that Bind, so it probably will last for quite some time…
Darkness! I’ll cut that wire with my dagger, so hang on!
Sorry, that’s the special mithril alloy wire that I commissioned…
Aaaah, come on, why!?
Chris, I’ll be fine! More importantly, the two of you, take that nail and go!
Don’t worry, the Count knows who I am. He might vent his frustration on me, but he won’t kill me. Forget about me, hurry up and go!
If I stab it with this dagger…
The more you stab it, the more tentacles he will be able to bring out! Just listen to her, Big Boss. Go bring the carriage over, there’s something I want to try.
Assistant-kun, Darkness! Hang in there! I’ll be back very soon!
Darkness, I don’t care which one, just pull one of your hands out. I’ll take this chance to pour Aqua’s juice down the hole!
I-I got it. But you shouldn’t force yourself to stay! Hurry up and go! Even I won’t be able to hold out against such a strong opponent for long…!
Darkness, show me your resolve! Show me that your stamina will not lose to any devil!
Leave it to me! Now, Lord Zereschrute, I might have lost to you this afternoon, but allow me to show you my true power!
Hey, why is this girl feeling elated? Is she crazy!? She’s crazy! She must be knocked in the head somewhere!
Assistant-kun, Assistant-kun, Senpai’s at the orphanage, right? I have, you know… something urgent to attend to…
Alright, I’ll pass your regards to everyone. You really helped us out, Big Boss.
Yeah, I’ll be going now.. Make sure this girl doesn’t push herself too far. And…
It’d be nice if I could tell her my true identity someday…
I’ve brought back the ingredient we need! Hey, Aqua, please see to Darkness’s wounds! Is Sylphina still…
Welcome home, Mommy!
Hey.
Ah, Aah, Aaah!
Well, Darkness seems to be pretty happy, so I guess it’s a good thing, but…
Oh, you’re back! Come and see how energetic these children are!
You’re back. Welcome home.
I managed to bring back the ingredients, but what’s up with this horrible scene?
Well… This is the result after Aqua got serious and repeatedly cast her healing magic trying to save the children. They were given far more vitality than they needed to beat the disease, and ended up far more energetic than anyone expected. As you can see, the results are…
Seems like all the ingredients have been assembled. If it weren’t for this woman’s efforts, most of the children in the orphanage would’ve been half dead by now. That muscle lady’s daughter might look healthy, but her body is still in a dreadful state, so it’s best to start brewing immediately. If it weren’t for this woman, you would’ve been cutting it close… Hey, storekeeper, it’s your turn to shine!
Great work, Darkness, Kazuma! Leave the rest to the number one genius of the Crimson Demons. Don’t worry, I spent many nights studying the recipe!
That’s wrong. You need to put this in first. I learnt that in school, so there’s no way I could be mistaken!
Nonsense! The knowledge of devils are the most accurate thing in this world! You can’t go wrong with following Moi’s instructions… Hey, you trouble-making woman, what did you just put in?
Don’t get in my way, you strange devil. What I just added it the Axis Cult’s Aqua water. With that, the effectiveness of the antidote will be massively boosted.
Why? Why do you always do something unnecessary!? Actually, what would you do if you accidentally touched the potion as it’s about to be completed and turned it into water!? Hurry up and get lost, you goddess of misfortune!
Everyone, as the owner of the magic shop, my recipe is obviously correct. Don’t worry, there aren’t any mistakes, so just follow my instructions!
I don’t care what you guys do, just hurry it up!
EXPLOOOSION!
Wow…
How many points is that?
I feel that the shockwave today is a little weaker. Can I assume that you reduced its power for Sylphina’s sake, since she just recently recovered from her illness?
Precisely. A true master of explosive magic can obviously adjust its destructive power. It’s only natural to keep the audience in mind if they are present.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Say, Kazuma, were you guys always doing this kind of stupid things?
Darkness, how could you call this stupid? You’re saying the same things as Aqua!
Exactly! Even if it’s you, I won’t forgive you if you keep saying that.
Very well, I’ll accept that challenge, Megumin! Now, bring it on whenever you want!
Ah, wait, Darkness! How could you take advantage of me when I can’t move! Please stop! Ah, no, they’ll see my panties, stop pulling at my skirt! I’ll start calling you Lewdness like Kazuma does… Okay, I surrender! I surrender, so please stop! Kazuma, hurry up replenish my mana with Drain Touch!
By the way, where did Aqua go off to?
It seems like she realized she could use the shockwave from Explosion for fishing. Lately she’s always been rushing around to gather the fish that float up after each Explosion.
Thanks to her, we are probably going to have to use this spot for Explosions for some time. What a drag.
Everyone, look! It’s a big haul today! I might even consider bringing one back as a souvenir to that ill-mannered demonic black furball.
That kid has grown picky as of late. She won’t eat raw fish or bland food. The other day, she followed me into the shower and started using Aqua’s laundry as a scratching post. I wonder what’s going on with her.
Wait a second, what did she do with my laundry? Why is that kid only hostile to me!?
I personally gathered these fishes, so obviously the biggest one would go to me.
Hold on, Aqua, while the one who gathered them might be you, but I’m the one who killed them. The biggest one should obviously go to the most capable in this party, me.
Umm, I’ll give you half of my fish… I can’t eat that much anyway…
That won’t do, Sylphina. Children need to eat more. Otherwise you’ll end up with nutrient-deficient body like Megumin.
Oh, now you’ve said it! Then let’s use strength to decide who receives the biggest fish! Bring it on! Come at me whenever you want!
Thank you.
After boldly proclaiming that I will protect you back then, I ended up getting saved by you again.
This isn’t the first time it’s happened, and it’ll probably keep happening. Ah, I’m getting really tired of cleaning up after you all. Well, I did manage to save that girl, so I guess it’s fine. Plus, I did have an adventurer-like experience for once.
…Just confirming, but you really aren’t a lolicon, right?
Do you want me to punch you!? Why don’t I use your body to demonstrate that I’m not a lolicon!?
You don’t have the guts to go through anyway.
There’s a very good reason why I don’t cross that line. I… no, all the men in this city have a very reliable companion.
Is that so? Then I’ll wait till you wish to tell me. What kind of life you really led before you came here, where did you come from… and, while you’re at it, what Chris’ true identity is.
Eh? Wait, you were awake back when Chris said that?
Of course. I’m the Crusader with the strongest defensive power and stamina in this city. How could I stay unconscious for that long? I’m going to need to properly lecture Chris one of these days.
…Ah, it seems I like you more than I thought…
I-I, umm, Megumin…
I understand.
I’m older than you all, and a noble above that. I have no intention of tearing apart my friends by throwing a childish tantrum. I don’t want that to happen. But…
You can forgive a little bit of teasing, can’t you?
Y-You…
You need to pay more attention to the time and place. Look behind you.
?
Mo-Mommy, sorry, I…
W-Wait a minute, Sylphina, this is—
While I did say that it’s fine to express your feelings, I didn’t recall allowing you to have a secret affair with him. Pushing your child onto someone else to have a tryst, just how much of a pervert are you!?
Bu-but… that’s…
I need to let everyone know… Darkness tried to force herself on Kazuma-san, I need to let everyone know…!
W-Wait, that’s not it! Well, it’s not exactly untrue but— Ah, Aqua! Get back here!
Well, this doesn’t feel too bad. It’s like I’m the main character of a harem show. I’ve gone through plenty of hardships so far, but it seems like my luck is still pretty good.
This man…!
Here you go, Kazuma-san. Black tea and some cookies. These cookies happen to be Aqua-sama’s favourite.
Sorry for making you deal with Aqua every day… Oh, this black tea is delicious. You must have used some good leaves. I’m used to living the celebrity life, so I know quite a bit about stuff like this.
S-Sorry, but I can only afford the cheapest black tea for this shop…
I see, so it’s all about the person brewing the tea. Well done, Wiz. If your shop ever runs out of business, you can always become my maid.
Please don’t say such things, Kazuma-san! B-but, if that ever happens, I might take you up on your offer…
There you are, Kazuma! Big news! We have big news!
Kazuma-san, Wiz-san, sorry for intruding. Um, we were doing research on Mages who have the potential to be our future rivals, and…
The Ice Witch is in this very city!
She was the leader of a party that wanted to be known as the strongest adventurer group. Even though she isn’t a Crimson Demon, she’s an extremely skilled mage who could use all kinds of magic, including Advanced Magic. She kills monsters and soldiers of the Demon King’s Army without mercy, even if they begged for their lives. That’s how she got her nickname – The Ice Witch.
So… What happened to that witch? You don’t even know who she is, do you?
About that, we know that she put her life on the line to challenge one of the Demon King’s Generals, but after that, all traces of her vanished. Her name and personal information are being kept secret by the Adventurer’s Guild, so all we know about her is that she’s a woman.
Hey, why don’t they know it’s you? They know that you were a famous adventurer, right?
The people in this town only know that I was a member of a high level party. And… While Megumin-san’s story is slightly exaggerated, I can’t say that it’s wrong, so I’m afraid that they might become scared of me…
What are you two talking about there!? The Ice Witch is in this very town, you know!? That Ice Witch!
Why are you two so obsessed with her? What would you even do after meeting her? Ask her for an autograph?
The Ice Witch has such a cool name! I couldn’t possibly ignore her! I want to challenge her to see if she’s better than a Crimson Demon!
I-I don’t really agree with that, but I’m curious as to what kind of person she is…
I’m sure the Ice Witch wanted to live a quiet and peaceful life in this town. Please leave her alone.
T-That’s right… And I heard that the Ice Witch is a really scary person!
I-is that so? As a Crimson Demon, I wanted to settle this…
H-hey Megumin, Wiz-san has good common sense, so maybe we should heed her words. I’m sure that rumour about her was true…
What rumour are you talking about? It might have been greatly exaggerated, you know?
…Because all the other members of her party have paired up, the Ice Witch was left single, so she cursed this world and launched a suicide attack on the Demon King’s castle…
I heard that the Ice Witch was slaughtering monsters to vent her frustrations over being unable to find a boyfriend. Well, in any case…
She must look really ugly if she was passed over within her party and had such a scary nickname. That’s how the rumour goes…
Owowowowow…! Hey, why do you only raise your claws against me!? We’ve lived under the same roof for almost a year by now. Isn’t it about time we reached some sort of understanding?
Ah! Stop right there! How dare you touch my biscuits! I hope you’re prepared for the consequence of stealing a goddess’ offerings!
This cat must really hate you. Even I’ve been getting along well with it. I often wake up from naps to it sleeping on my belly.
And why does that happen? Is it because the two of you are evil spirits, so that’s why you two get along so well? Cats symbolize laziness, right? Could it be attracted to the epitome of laziness?
Oh, what’s this? Seems like you’re getting stared down right now. Let me translate her catspeak for you. ‘While cats do seem to symbolize laziness, their true duty is to bring happiness to people in a lazy way-nya. You have the least say out of anyone on the topic of laziness-nya. From now on, you should stop calling yourself the Goddess of Water and start calling yourself the Goddess of Sloth-nya.
You’re pretty brave to say that to my face! I will have to teach you and that arrogant ‘nya nya nya’ furball a lesson today!
In addition to sloth, why not list violence under your name too huh, you mad goddess!? Get rid of that irritable attitude right— Oh? What is it? Do you have something so say?
Hey, Aqua, I wanna ask you something. Do you goddesses grow? Or in other words, say you lose more than half of your power, how would you go about replenishing it?
Isn’t it obvious? It’s obviously faith-based. The power of goddesses comes from their beloved followers. By the way, even goddesses grow too, you know? I’ve only stopped growing because my beauty and power are both maxed out.
…O goddess, hallowed be thy name…
Wait a minute, why are you suddenly praying to a cat? If you wanna pray, do it to me.
Oh, have my honest prayers been answered?
… … This thing… What does it find so attractive about Kazuma?
I’m back.
Wuah, how could my familiar be sleeping in such a place without any consideration for its master who’s busy outside!? It’s been getting way too picky about food recently too. A willful demon like that deserves punishment!
Nyaaargh!
Sa-Say, Megumin, could you also let me hold Chomusuke?
I refuse. If you really want to touch this furball that badly, then go clean the bathroom in my stead today.
Ahhhh, how unreasonable!
Aah, I lost again! Hey, Chris, how are you so good at cards? Kazuma’s only good point is being lucky, but I think you’re even luckier than him.
Isn’t that obvious? It’s because Big Boss is-
A-Assistant-kun?
-A Thief of the Eris Church.
Ah, yeah. Eris is the goddess of fortune, and it’s only natural for a thief to have high luck. Yeah, I get it now.
Say, between Chris and Kazuma, just who has the higher luck?
Of course, that’ll be me. Remember when I was manning Aqua-san’s store during the Eris thanksgiving festival? None of the customers received a winning lot. It’d be pretty difficult for Kazuma to do the same thing.
Wait, what are you saying? That did happen, but didn’t I successfully steal your panties? The success rate of Steal is highly dependent on Luck. That means that my luck is higher.
No, hold on, that doesn’t count! Resisting Steal requires high magic resistance! I’m a Thief! Of course I wouldn’t have any magic resistance!
This is my current luck stat, and it’s still growing as I level. I’m sure you know what this means.
As expected of Kazuma whose only high stat is luck. I really wish I could get even one percent of that.
Hey, what do you mean by that? My intelligence is pretty high too.
So, what about yours?
Come on, let me see!
Seriously? Is the value on her luck stat bugged? I should take this up with a guild worker.
N-No, it’s fine! It’s not like it’s causing me any problems…
But this is a problem. There’s no way to tell who has the higher luck like this.
Why don’t you guys decide this through a game of Rock-paper-scissors?
Rock-paper-scissors? Well, I’m fine with it, but can Assistant-kun really best me in luck? You haven’t forgotten who I am, have you?
Do you really think I relied solely on my luck to defeat all those Demon King’s Generals? There’s no way I would accept such a challenge without something up my sleeve.
Oh? You sure talk a big game. Come to think of it, didn’t you lose to me in a contest of Steal back then? Do you intend to use this chance to take your revenge?
Very well, let’s decide this once and for all! As adventurers, we should act like adventurers and give this our all. Rock, paper-!
Eh? Wait, now? Eh, hold on, er— paper!
Wait, assistant-kun, why are you stripping!? There’s no need to strip! I’ve already won!
What are you saying? Aren’t we adventurers that put our lives on the line? We can’t possibly play the same kind of games that children do, can we? Are you saying I’ve already lost?
Okay, very well, I accept. After all, there’s no way I can lose!
That’s what I’m talking about! Everyone, show me some support!
I’m rooting for you! Blessing!
May the Blessings of Aqua be upon you! Blessing!
Hey, call some more priests over! Aqua-san, please…
If Kazuma loses, let me go next! I’m a thief too! I’m pretty confident in my luck!
Hey, no fair! Other people shouldn’t be allowed to support you like this! Assistant-kun, wait!
Just then, just when I thought I finally got away, I felt something land on top of my head. I looked up…
And saw a large swarm of cellar spiders crawling on the ceiling above me!
WAAAAAH!
U-Umm, this is quite scary and all, but it feels somewhat different from what I had in mind…
What are you saying, Kazuma? Those are cellar spiders, you know? The little ones that scuttle everywhere and will drop onto your body if you let your guard down for even a moment! There’re very few other things that are scarier…
Please stop, Aqua-chan! It’s reminding me of the last time I went into a dungeon…
Then let me tell you a special horror story of mine. This happened on my tenth birthday…
My family is very poor, so we often have troubles getting food. So, on the day of my tenth birthday, well, I didn’t really expect too much for my celebration, but… my sister gave me a birthday present.
So, the present… She must have spent quite a bit of effort to gather them up for me. Her face was caked with mud when she happily walked up to me and said ‘Onee-chan, I caught a lot of big and black ones!’ before giving me a wriggling bag-
WAAAAAH!
Stop that, this isn’t the kind of story I wanted to hear! These aren’t horror stories at all!
Th-Then… let me go next… I have a story where a mysterious girl’s scream could be heard coming from the basement of a certain noble’s mansion every night…
Yeah, and then upon investigation, it turns out to be that noble having a tryst with a female servant every night, right? … Hey, don’t just go silent on me. We are asking for horror stories here, not erotic ones.
Then, how about you share a story, Kazuma? You must have some great ones, right?
– I see, anyone who sees a picture of that woman will die within a week. So it’s like Premonition of Death? But with Aqua-chan around, wouldn’t that problem be easily resolved? Compared to that woman, that terrifyingly skilled Dullahan is far scarier.
Also, about that Sadako ghost, how would you communicate with her if you don’t have that ‘telephone’ magic item that Kazuma mentioned? Doesn’t she only appear if someone is already using that item? Suddenly appearing from behind like that, is she using the Lurk skill to sneak up on them? Wouldn’t that just make her a burglar who only targets folks who are rich enough to afford that item?
Then let me tell a story next. This will definitely be very scary for men.
In a city somewhere, there’s a man who lives by himself. That man is troubled by door-to-door salesmen continuously pestering him, and eventually thought of a great idea to deter them.
However, one day, the man heard a knock on his door, and wondered if he was hearing things. That’s because this is what is written on the sign he placed.
Written on the sign is ‘The resident of this house is a hardcore homosexual. If you are prepared for what comes after, feel free to knock on the door.
WAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Shopkeeper with the rare skill of exclusively stocking up on trash, why don’t you go ahead and explain to Moi, why exactly is this garbage sitting in front of us?
Calling my skills rare… I’ll still buy this item even if you compliment me, Vanir-san.
Moi was not complimenting you, you useless shopkeep! Just tell me the good points of this product!
The products I bought this time are stuffed animals. Of course, it’s not simply a cute looking toy. Behold! It’s a wondrous item that will automatically follow its owner once they are registered! By giving them to children, we’ll never have to worry about children getting lost ever again!
I see. Tell me, what exactly are its downsides?
Roger! It’ll always follow its owner even if they aren’t lost, so I suppose it might cause the children to cry when they wake up in the middle of the night to visit the toilet.
Vanir-san! Do you really wish to abandon the lost children of the world!?
Do you really want to hear the cries of children so badly?
Onee-san, thank you very much for your help the other day.
This is Wiz’s Magical Item Shop. It’s stocked full of various useful items. If you ever feel unwell again, or run into some other problem… Please feel free to visit anytime.
Mommy!
You think you can make fun of the nobility and they’ll just take it lying down? Stay right there! I’ll kill all of you!
Mommy, why you angry? I’m hungry, mommy! Give me boobie-Gaaah!
Come on, Darkness, acting so violently during a party is against etiquette, you know? Look at everyone having fun. Is it really so hard to read the mood?
A-Aqua is telling me to read the mood…
Mommy! I need your help collecting ingredients for my cure, so boobie- ah, wait, ow ow ow ow!
If you want boobs so much, why don’t you use your own!? Here, I’ll squeeze them for you!
Stop! Lalatina-chan, stop! You’re tearing them off!
There’s a child here, so stop screaming about boobs this and boobies that! Megumin’s mood is getting worse, so let’s put a stop to all this boob talk right here!
You’re the one who said it the most, Aqua! And I’m not in a bad mood, don’t make it sound like I have a complex about my breasts!
T-Thank you very much, everyone. I’ve recovered thanks to you…
Right, it’s Darkness’s treat, so let’s drink till we drop! I’m in a good mood today, so let me show you my special party trick!
Uuu, I feel like I always end up getting teased whenever I visit the adventurer’s guild recently… Just why did it end up like this…?
Alright, cut it out!
Ka-Kazuma…
Her boobs belong only to me!
I’ll kill you!
Right, then please sign or stamp here. Thank you very much! We’ll be receiving many other high-quality ingredients in the future, so please visit us again. Thank you for your patronage!
Ah, thank you! I’ll hit you up again soon!
…Say, Kazuma, just what exactly did you order?
This? Hehe, listen and be amazed! This is that famous dragon meat!
Dragon meat!? You splurged again!?
Shut up, you penniless noble! You don’t understand the economy at all!
Eh?
Listen up, Darkness, someone who can easily earn big bucks like me needs to constantly spend that money instead of simply sitting on it. If too many rich people sit on their money, it’ll cause the economy to stagnate. If anything, what I’m doing now is a praiseworthy act of charity.
Is-Is that so? I was taught to keep my feet firmly planted on the ground, so I don’t usually splurge on luxuries…
You really are foolish. There’s a proper reason for nobles to throw extravagant parties, you know? When rich nobles spend money, the money will end up in the hands of the commoners in the town. And when the commoners have money, that will naturally attract merchants seeking to make a profit off them. When a city has more merchants, life in the town will become more comfortable and bustling. Once such rumours spread, new residents will be attracted to live in the town, and as the residents in the city increase, so would the tax revenue that the nobles collect.
Wha… I-Is that how it works?!
That’s why I’m living such a luxurious life. Plus, I’ve heard that eating dragon meat can raise your stats. My stats haven’t been increasing much recently even after leveling up from eating high-quality ingredients. I’m just using my wealth to further raise my power in preparation for future battles with the Demon King’s Generals.
Ka-Kazuma… you even thought that far… In that case, I’ll use my family’s funds to buy dragon meat for you.
W-well, we shouldn’t take it too far. And, you know, eating dragon meat every day will get tiresome, so we don’t have to buy it every day. I just heard it was a high-quality ingredient, so I bought it to sample…
I didn’t expect you to be willing to brave the tough and stinky dragon meat to become stronger… I really misjudged you. I don’t really like eating dragon meat because it’s so disgusting, but… It’ll be fine. This is to raise our power as adventurers, so I’m sure my father will understand.
Hey, is dragon meat really tough and stinky? It’s a high-quality ingredient, so isn’t it supposed to be delicious?
Dragons are the strongest of monsters. They are mostly muscle with little fat to speak of, and their flesh stinks just like the flesh of other carnivores. It’s only high-quality because it increases your stats if you eat it.
Say, Megumin, do you have any interest in high-quality-
I have pride in my lineage as a Crimson Demon, so why would I have any interest in the power of dragons? You can have that draconic power all to yourself.
… Aqua, you’re a gourmet like me, so-
I already have high stats, so there’s no point in raising them any higher. I’ll pass on dragon’s meat. You can savour it all by yourself, weakling.
What are you saying?! You’re eating this too! Maybe some dragon meat will finally raise that pitiful intelligence of yours!
Whose intelligence is pitiful, you brute!? The brilliant me has no need for that stuff. Look at this! Would someone with pitiful intelligence be capable of making such a thing?
Clay figurine number two, Explosion Maniac Megumin! I’m quite proud of how this turned out. I’m sure it’ll fetch quite a high price.
Hold on, Aqua! That’s what you were making with all that clay? You didn’t add any dangerous details under the dress, did you?!
I couldn’t help it, I ran out of pocket money. That strange devil said that he’ll buy anything of worth I wish to sell, so I’ve been making figurines of the adventurers in Axel and selling it to him.
Then you could’ve just made figurines of yourself! Ah, hold on, it feels like the panties can be removed too! You didn’t…!
Say, can you sell that to me?
I’ll give you a discount.
I’ll blow both of you up! Give that to me, Aqua! In the first place, didn’t you already get some pocket money from Kazuma!? What do you keep spending all of it on!?
Hey, Aqua, about what you said earlier… you said it’s clay figurine number 2, right? Then, number one is…
Clay figurine number one is scantily-clad noble, Lewdtina. It was really tough to recreate the lewd negligee you often wear as of late. Though, I got quite a good price for it.
Umm, is Megumin here?
-It’s just low-grade tea, but, please enjoy.
T-Thank you very much.
Um, this is just a simple gift, but…
… Well, it’s nice for you to bring gifts, but what did you come here for?
This is a letter I got from the village…
Let’s see… My glorious comrades, the time has come. Now’s the time to sharpen your axes and show off the fangs that you’ve so carefully honed. May all who have received this letter return to the Crimson Demon Village within the month-
I see, so you acknowledge me as a potential chief of the Crimson Demons. Very well, let’s make preparations for the journey, Yunyun! Let me demonstrate that I am indeed the one most suitable to be declared the most exalted of the Crimson Demons!
Eeh? You need to at least know Advanced Magic and Teleport to even undertake the trial, you know? And we don’t need to make any preparations, I can take us there in an instant with Teleport.
…Then why did you bring this letter to me?
Knowing you, if I don’t tell you in advance, I’m sure you’ll come and make trouble for me. You’re my rival… Ow! C-cut it out! Don’t vent your anger on me just because you don’t have the qualifications to take the trial.
Kazuma, seems like she’s done with her business here, so shall we get to work on dinner?
Yeah, we should. Hey, it’s getting late, so why don’t you join us for dinner, Yunyun? You even brought us a gift, after all.
C-Can I?! But having dinner together feels like a family affair, so I feel like I shouldn’t be here, actually in the first place visiting this late is my fault, so, sorry, Kazuma-san, but showing up at a friend’s house uninvited and joining them for dinner is, ah, no, it’s not like I dislike it, actually I’m really happy that you invited me and-
Oh shut up, it’s just having dinner together! You don’t need to get that excited over it!
Wiz, Vanir, are you here? I had some free time, so I came to visit…
Why, why can’t you just listen what Moi says! Moi is the devil that sees through all! If you would just listen to me and follow my instructions, you wouldn’t end up in the red! Why must you attract garbage to you like a lamp attracts bugs in the summer!?
If I only listen to what Vanir-san says, then it might as well be your shop! I want to make this shop prosper together with you, Vanir-san! We are immortal, so we can both take our time! And the items I brought in today aren’t garbage!
What are you guys arguing about this early in the morning? Did Wiz bring in some strange products again?
Oh, if it isn’t the newly-rich brat! Moi has gotten some really good products today! Hey, hurry up and get rid of that garbage!
I’ll say it upfront, but I don’t need it. Anyway, it doesn’t seem like Darkness has arrived yet. I heard her say that she was going to bring Sylphina here to thank you for all the help you’ve provided during that incident.
The best form of thanks would be to buy those pieces of trash off my hands. Still, she really is an honest noble lady. She tearfully bought the scantily-clad noble figurine at double the price last night. Anyway, brat who’s been proceeding well with your companions recently, Moi really has a good deal for you today, so why not hear me out?
I won’t buy anything that seems suspicious… what’s this?
It’s a contraceptive. By the way, it goes for ten thousand eris.
Right.
Thank you for your patronage! If a man takes a sip from it, it’ll remain effective for a week. And, esteemed customer, there are some energizing potions and aromatics that will help put things in the mood here that will go well with that…
I’ll buy them. I’ll buy them all.
Thank you very much!
You look pretty pleased with yourself, just what did you buy?
I bought some things to protect my companions. You’re all my important companions, after all. It wouldn’t do to start panicking if something does happen.
After saving Sylphina the other day… You always have your companions in mind…
Uh, yeah.
Vanir-sama, please help me-!
Sacred High Exorcism!
Byaaaaaa!
What’s with this pen-pen? Hey, Kazuma, this pen-pen just reeks of a devil. I really hate that it looks this cute while smelling like that.
You really have no mercy… This is the something-or-the-other count that we visited in order to get the ingredient we need for Sylphina’s cure… Though it seems like he’s dead now.
I see, so this is the devil that bullied Darkness. I just let my magic loose because I felt something unpleasant, but this is fine. I wanted to go exorcise him after hearing the story from you.
That’s unfair, Aqua. I wanted to take revenge for Darkness too…
Eh?
Sacred High-
Hey, stop that, you’ll vanquish him again. Come on, he’s already scared out of his wits.
V-V-Vanir-sama, this violent blue-haired woman, could she be…
Yes, as you might have suspected, she’s our natural enemy. Your remaining lives were all purified by her upon entering my store, but because you expired in front of me, Moi was able to restore one of your lives. However, if you run into her in the future without me around, then that’ll be it.
Um… I don’t know who you are, but you are an acquaintance of Vanir-san, yes? I’ll go put on some tea.
A-Ah, I don’t need to eat or drink, so you don’t have to do that for me…
So, what brings you here today, Zereschrute? Actually, you are a high-ranking devil in your own right, so Moi really didn’t expect you to be vanquished from just a single blow. What happened to the other lives you had in stock?
T-that’s… I ran into a big problem recently…
The Goddess Eris has been appearing at my castle every day to kill me. That’s why all my lives are gone.
Say, Kazuma, I’m starting to feel sorry for this penguin. Of course, I still won’t let him off.
No, actually, do let him off. He’s an aristocrat of this country, and from what I know he’s been doing a pretty good job…
Hey, aren’t you the young man who was with Lady Darkness back then? Could you please tell your companion to lay off me? I’m merely an upstanding devil that enjoys the feelings of anguish and humiliation. You seem to know Goddess Eris somehow, so can you please help me out here?
I would like to help, but it’s not like I can contact her anytime I want.
Is that so… I quite liked that castle, but it seems like I have no choice but to let it go…
So, what do you intend to do from now? Moi would not recommend living in this town. There’s a rabid, devil-hating hound that claims this place as her territory, after all.
I heard that the Succubi have set up shop in this town, so I came to ask if I could be hired as a bouncer or helper. And if a customer with some special tastes show up, with the aid of the Succubi, I’ll be able to taste my favourite feelings of anguish and humiliation. I thought it was a good plan, but…
I’ll immediately exorcise you if I see you in this town.
Aqua, there’s a zipper on the back. I really want to see what’s inside.
Yeah, you shouldn’t be fooled by his cute appearance. Oh, what’s with this flipper!? Hurry up and show us what’s inside! Otherwise I’ll purify you!
Don’t, wait, stop!
Sorry to disturb you, Wiz, Vanir. I’m sure you’ve heard from Kazuma, but I’m here today to than-…eh?
Well, well, if it isn’t Lady Dustiness who invaded my castle the other day and made a right mess of things. Hehehe, to think we would meet again like this…
Ahhhh!
W-Why is Lord Zereschrute here?
I’m saying this for your own good, but I think it’ll be best if you hurry up and leave this town.
Even if you say that, I escaped from my castle in the middle of the night, so I don’t have any money nor a place to stay.
Young man, is the girl next to Darkness the one you needed the medicine for?
Yeah. Her name is Sylphina. She’s Darkness’s daughter.
Hey, Kazuma, stop saying that she’s my daughter… N-No, you’re my daughter, Sylphina, so don’t make such a face.
Oh, it’s good to see that she’s well! You don’t need to be so guarded, Lady Dustiness. As a devil, it’s only natural for me to come to blows with a Crusader. I don’t hold a grudge over that incident.
I don’t really get it, but if you say so… Still, what are you doing so far from your territory?
… Say, Kazuma, you met with Eris-sama when you died, right? Does she seem like she has a lot of free time on her hands?
You’ll receive divine punishment if you say that sort of things. Rather than having free time, it’s more like she’s taking revenge for you.
I-is that so? Why is Eris-sama keeping such a close eye on me… Still, I’m terribly sorry, Lord Zereschrute. You might be a devil, but it’s not like you’ve done any wicked acts…
No, there’s no need to apologize. Managing a territory is fun, but it’s about time I moved on to something new. But, if you really feel that way, I would appreciate it if you could use the backing of the Dustiness house to allow me to live in this town.
Don’t get ahead of yourself just because you’ve helped Darkness’s child. She seems quite attached to you, so I won’t purify you in front of her, but I make no such guarantees if we were to meet on a secluded street somewhere.
Emergency quest! Emergency quest! All adventurers in town, please gather at the guild hall immediately.
Before you say it, I didn’t do anything.
Hey, why are you staring at me like that, Kazuma? I don’t know anything about this.
I’ve got no idea about this either. I’ve been properly toeing the regulations concerning the locations and usage of Explosion.
Hey, don’t look at me. I’m the one who’s the least likely to cause any trouble. That tax collection incident only happened because the guild came to consult me.
I repeat, all adventurers within the town, please gather at the guild hall immediately… All adventurers…
The Treasure Island has appeared!
Hey, what is going on? Explain it- damn, you’re fast!
What’s up with them!? Leaving Vanir and Aqua aside, even Wiz ran out like she was possessed.
What are you saying, Kazuma? It’s the Treasure Island! It’s a literal island of treasure! We shouldn’t be wasting time here, let’s hurry up and go!
I-I’ll have to stay here to take care of Sylphina…
Kazuma! I picked up a set for you! Come on, let’s head out of town! Hurry!
Hey, come on, properly explain it to me already! Just what is a Treasure Island? Judging from the name and your reactions, it seems to be a pretty profitable quest, but…
Treasure Island is the common name of the genbu. A giant tortoise known as a genbu has appeared outside of town. The genbu spends most of its time underground, and only surfaces once every ten years. It’s said that it rises up to sun its shell in order to rid itself of the mushrooms, parasites, and other harmful creatures that have taken root on its body, but no one knows for sure. What we do know is that it will remain on the surface until the sun goes down. And genbu lives on a diet of precious gems and metals deep underground, and such precious gems and metals will be stuck to its shell.
Isn’t that giant tortoise going to attack the people digging into its shell? And there are already a lot of adventurers who went on ahead of us. Won’t it all be gone by the time we get there?
The Treasure Island is a very docile creature. As long as no one does anything too crazy, it won’t attack people. And there’s no need to worry about all the treasure being gone. Soon, you’ll see why people call it a Treasure Island… Anyway, what is the weird devil doing here? Genbu are divine beasts. Divine beasts are the enemies of devils, you know?
If it were up to me, Moi wouldn’t be doing this either! But this useless shopkeeper once again bought some garbage and put us in the red again! If Moi doesn’t do something soon, this month’s rent will be…
It’ll be fine, Vanir-san! We might be in the red now, but if I properly raise the goods I bought, I’m sure we’ll end up making a huge profit… s-so don’t look at me like so coldly, you’re scaring me!
… Am I dreaming?
Let’s go, Kazuma! We have until sunset! We are going to dig until our rucksacks are full to bursting!
Right, now that I’m here, time to put in some effort… Oh, isn’t that Dust and the others? They are here too?
… Say, I don’t know how much this is worth, but is it really that easy to make money with this? Actually, aren’t there only adventurers here? There isn’t much danger, so wouldn’t it be better to get the citizens out to help too?
It’s obviously because it’s dangerous.
Aaaah, crap! I dug into a rock mimic!
H-hey, what is that? Isn’t this bad? Hey guys, should we hurry up and help…?
Leave them alone! Everyone here is an adventurer! They’ve already resolved themselves to die at any moment! Going out there to help him would be to trample all over that resolve!
Exactly! Even if they can’t fend them off by themselves, dying on a quest is an honour for an adventurer! And… And my debts…!
A-Are you really fine with that? What happened to your humanity?
Pl-Please help me!
… He’s crying out for help, you know? Are you sure you want to leave him alone, you self-proclaimed whatever?
Ahahahaha! This is high-quality manatite! And this one is flaretite! I was worried about my lack of pocket money, but I’ll have more than enough after this!
Uuu… I’ll be able to cover rent somehow if I sell my body… don’t worry, I won’t die even if I sell my body… yes, I won’t die…
Hey, Wiz, just stay here and dig, I’ll go help him in your place!
It’ll be fine, Kazuma-san. A lich’s fingernails and hair have high concentrations of mana. I’ll be able to get quite a bit of money by selling them as materials to the adventurer’s guild.
W-Wait, stop. Seriously, stop! That’s what you mean by selling your body? Anyway, all we have to do is to quickly help him out and get back to mining. Hey, Megumin, Aqua, let’s go. It’ll be over in a flash with the four of us here.
Tsk, just when time is of the essence… You damned rock mimics dare get in my way!? Eat this!
Normally Moi would rather puke blood than lend a helping hand to a goddess, but I’ll ignore it just this once. Let’s just hurry up and get this over with. Vanir-Style Death Ray!
Hey, if you could’ve taken care of them so easily, you should’ve done it from the start!
Oh, shut up! This month’s rent isn’t some kind of joke, it’s a matter of life and death! I hope you are satisfied with that, useless shopkeep! Hurry up and clear some of your debts!
… Say, Megumin, can you do something for me?
…Eeh!? A-Are you sure? Well, I haven’t used my Explosion yet today, and it’s certainly a suitable target for my one day, one explosion routine…
But are you really sure about this? Treasure Islands are docile creatures, but if you blast one with Explosion, it might just anger it enough to attack. Plus, there’s an ironclad rule amongst us adventurers to never attack a Treasure Island…
Well, it’s just my intuition, but the Treasure Island won’t get angry. If anything, it’ll probably be elated. It’ll be fine as long as you follow my instructions and don’t hit it directly. So, please, Megumin.
I’m not responsible for what happens after this, okay? And even an explosion artisan like me might slip up sometimes.
Eh? Wait, what are you two doing?
Explosion!!!
Say, Kazuma, those are payment for Megumin’s Explosion, right? Then it’s fine for us to pick them up and sell them, right?
With this, the debts of the store and the rent will be…
Kazuma-san, Kazuma san! I have a little favour to ask of you.
What is it? I’m not giving you any more pocket money. I already gave you this month’s allowance, and you should’ve made a lot of money with the ore you got from the Treasure Island yesterday.
That’s not it. The favour I wanted is for you to lend me your strength as an adventurer.
You sure are saying some dangerous things early in the morning. Just what are we going up against? Just to let you know, I’ve already resolved to live a leisurely and peaceful life as a rich man. I’m not going to pick a fight with anything dangerous. If you want to go hunt some undead or settle a grudge with a devil, then go put a request up at the guild.
I’m not asking you to deal with monsters. I’ve had my fill of dangerous places, and I too would like to live a leisurely life as a rich person.
For now, can you come out to the yard? I would like you to demonstrate your amazing powers out there.
I don’t really get it, but I’m fine with it as long as it isn’t dangerous. Very well, I’ll demonstrate the hidden power sleeping within me.
Chirp.
… You really aren’t growing much at all, huh?
There’s a plot over there, right? I would like you to scatter plenty of nutrient-rich dirt over it.
… You’re asking me to use my power to plow the fields? Me, who could be considered a hero?
You too, Megumin? What, are you two planning on creating a home garden or something?
Oh, Kazuma, you’re finally awake. Look at this fine plot. If you scatter some magically-created dirt over here, we’ll definitely be able to grow some wonderful vegetables.
I always wanted to have a vegetable plot in the yard. We have the space, and vegetables are expensive, after all. We’ll be able to save on household costs, and we’ll also be able to eat fresh vegetables at any time. I’ll let you taste some tasty vegetable curry once it’s done.
Well, I’m happy about that and all, but… Is it fine for us amateurs to grow vegetables? They won’t fly around and attack people like cabbages, will they?
… You can’t just grow vegetables as you wish, right? You need some kind of permit or something, right?! Actually, where’s Darkness? She’s part of the government, that’s why you guys waited till she’s out to do this, right?!
Calm down, Kazuma. Sure, you do need some qualifications to grow vegetables, but high-level adventurers are allowed to start a vegetable garden at home. It’s a special privilege. And we are high-level adventurers, so there’s no issue.
Exactly. My level is already above forty. A home garden or two is acceptable for me.
It’s a little surprising that Megumin’s level is that high, but there you have it. So, I would like you to create some nutrient-rich earth for the plot. I know you like using Create Earth to blind others or create mud for use as a prank, but this is what it’s originally supposed to be used for.
Come to think of it, I have heard something like that before. Oh, what the hell, Create Earth.
Just to be sure, what seeds are you planting?
Komatsuna, potatoes, radishes, bell peppers, mackerel, and spinach. That farmer oji-san said that those vegetables grow well around here in this season.
… Say, was there something weird mixed in there just now?
Oh, you’re wondering why we are planting summer vegetables even though it’s almost winter, right? But this isn’t Japan. Vegetables are overflowing with vitality, so they’ll grow well even in winter.
… Phew. Finally, the sowing is done. I think we did pretty well. All we need to do now is regularly water them and give them a little massage here and there, and they’ll be ripe for harvesting by winter.
Hey, did you just say massage just now? We are growing vegetables here, right? We aren’t actually raising cattle or something, right?
We’re only planting some easily-cared-for vegetables right now, but we’ll definitely take on some tougher vegetables next year!
Yeah, let’s plant some cabbages or tomatoes in the spring, or even a mandrake or two next year!
I can’t ignore that! You said mandrake just now, right?! You want to plant a mandrake here?!
Why are you turning back now after coming all the way to someone else’s house?!
Me-Megumin?! What are you doing out here?
I visited unannounced just yesterday, so it’d be pretty awkward to visit again so soon. I was thinking that it’d be better to wait a few days before coming again…
It’s fine to visit everyday if you are free! Why do you keep worrying about all those little details?! Anyway, you probably came here for a reason, right?
C-Can I really visit every day? Will you really not find me annoying? You won’t suddenly stop talking upon hearing that I’ve come to visit…
I don’t care about that! If anything, your current attitude is more annoying! Anyway, hurry up and get to the point!
Actually, about that chieftain’s trial I talked about before…
— So, basically, the trial to decide the next chief of the Crimson Demons needs to be undertaken together with a partner, right?
Yes. In the past, the prospective chieftains would usually undertake the trial with an outsider swordsman as a vanguard, but… Well, Crimson Demons are stronger than any swordsman. Eventually, they realized that with two Crimson Demons as a team, they could just blow through the trial with pure firepower without caring about vanguard or backline positions.
So, you couldn’t find anyone else, so you came to invite me, huh? … You really are hopeless. Very well then, let me show you my power!
Eh? No, you won’t be of any help if you come along. You’ll just become a hindrance after a single blast. There are three stages to the trial, you know?
Well, I agree with your assessment, but if that’s the case, why did you come here?
T-That’s…
Actually, I have a friend… guy… no, an adventurer acquaintance who would be suitable for a vanguard, but when I asked him, he went ‘Huh? I made a whole ton of money off the Treasure Island, so I don’t think I’ll work for awhile. Well, if you can introduce me to a busty Crimson Demon onee-san, I wouldn’t mind helping you’, and other such horrible things… 
I don’t know who that is, but he doesn’t sound like a decent person. It’s best not to associate with such people, otherwise folks will start thinking that you’re birds of a feather.
No, it’s more like we just happen to run into each other a lot, or more like someone who frequents the same store that I do…
Umm, Kazuma-san! Would you accompany me to the Crimson Demon village and undertake the trial- Ow, ow, ow! What are you doing, Megumin!?
What am I doing?! What are you doing?! How could I possibly keep letting you use Kazuma as you please?! There’s no need to bother Kazuma with this! It’s just the trial of the Crimson Demons! I’ll be able to handle it!
Hey, Megumin, to be honest, if you come with me, it’ll just be a bother-
You can really say some mean things when you want to, huh?!
I’m a high-level Crimson Demon! I’ll be a much better vanguard than a low-level swordsman like him! It’s just a few monsters, I’ll smash all of them up with my manatite staff! Right, Kazuma, I’ll be leaving the house for a while!
Well then, I’ll be out of town for a while, so don’t do anything stupid while I’m away, okay?
Did you get the mistaken impression that you’ve become a sensible person recently? To tell you the truth, the most problematic person in this town might actually be you instead of Aqua.
Darkness, please keep an eye on those two for me while I’m out. Apart from a heightened sex drive, you’re pretty normal, so please make sure that Aqua doesn’t do something stupid and Kazuma doesn’t do something suicidal.
D-Don’t say that I have a heightened sex drive! Megumin too, you have the shortest temper in this town, so take care not to pick a fight with anyone you come across. I’ll keep an eye on Kazuma and make sure he doesn’t start following any random pretty girls that show up.
You are the one that gives me the most worries when it comes to the topic of women, but… Oh well. You two are the kind of people who chicken out when it actually happens, after all. Aqua, please keep an eye on them and make sure they don’t get up to anything inappropriate.
I got it. It’s a little early for them to start having children. If I hear any strange noises, I’ll make sure to remind them to take proper precautions.
You don’t get it at all! Ah, just make sure not to leave those two alone.
Hey, I know how to control myself, you know? I did properly reject Darkness instead of becoming the captain of two boats.
Oh, yeah, I suppose you did properly reject Darkness. Sorry, I should have a little more trust in you.
… Step out into the yard, I’ll teach you two a lesson.
Well then, I’m off to blow right through that trial back in the Crimson Demon village. Please behave yourself while I’m gone.
Right, now that Megumin is gone, lets settle the division of chores. She said she’ll be back in a few days, but we should still properly settle this.
I’m getting pretty tired of being put on toilet duty all the time. Please give me some cooking duties or the like.
No, every time you cook, you end up wasting most of the ingredients. You always end up turning a few bottles of seasonings into water. It’s too wasteful.
Then I’ll handle cooking. Darkness’s cooking is pretty plain, and Aqua’s out of the question. In return, Darkness will handle the cleaning, and Aqua will handle the toilets and the baths.
S-Say, is my cooking really that plain? I thought I’d have at least have a certain level of cooking skill…
Why am I always in charge of the toilets!? And isn’t it a little unfair to be only in charge of the cooking? We’ve got a new vegetable plot to take care of now, so you should at least help a little!
Vegetable plot? Hey, Aqua, why is this the first time I’ve heard about it? Did you make a plot in the yard!? It’s illegal for an amateur to grow vegetables, you know!?
You look pretty intelligent, but you are actually surprisingly dumb, aren’t you, Darkness? High-level adventurers are an exception to that law! Come on, take a look at my adventurer’s card! Now, lend me a hand! I’ll give you a few delicious vegetables too!
Wait, Aqua, I have a really bad feeling about this, so please stop this home garden project! The only thing I can see down that road is our vegetables causing trouble for our neighbours!
…Hmm?
That said, trouble always has a way of flinging itself at my door…Sigh, being a hero sure is tough.
…Hah!?
Oho, ‘Exploring the mystery of the strongest of the weakest job, Satou Kazuma: The man who defeated countless high bounty monsters and Demon King’s Generals despite having the job of Adventurer’. Chomusuke, take a look. This is a newspaper. It’s a really big deal for your name to appear on it. Hey, don’t use it as a scratching post!
Aqua! Aqua! Come over here quick! Take a look at… Wait, hold on.
Right, these beautiful girls they are referring to are…
Hey, this is a little off.
Please don’t come all the way out to the frontiers to hunt me down. As long as you don’t pick a fight with me, I won’t cause any trouble for you.
Let’s go on an extermination quest!
Killing monsters is the job of adventurers, so I don’t mind, but is it really okay with just us? Shouldn’t we wait for Megumin to come back?
That’s exactly it! Megumin is in our party. Of course, that’s a good thing, but I just recently noticed something. Because Megumin usually deals the finishing blow, our levels barely rise. Of course, I’m already perfect, so my level going up wouldn’t mean much, but still, I’m like the figurehead of this party. If I’m not the highest leveled person in it, our reputation would suffer, wouldn’t it?
I don’t know when you became our party’s figurehead, but, yeah, I would like to raise my level too.
I occasionally exorcise the ghosts at the cemetery together with Darkness, but it seems like stray ghosts just won’t cut it. They aren’t worth much experience points at all. So, let’s take this chance to gain a ton of levels. It’ll surely surprise Megumin when she gets back.
Megumin might throw a fit if she finds out we had an adventure without her, you know?… Still, she’s off in the Crimson Demon village undergoing some trial or the other right now, and it’d be bad if the gap in our levels continues to widen any further…
It’s fine to talk about closing the gap in our levels, but how exactly do you plan on doing so? The only one who gains any experience points is the one who deals the finishing blow, right? Neither of you have any methods of attack.
Don’t worry, I have a plan. Just leave it to me!
… I found it. Is everyone ready?
H-Hey, Aqua, you’re not going to…
First, I’ll stop his movements with my attacks. Then, Kazuma, use Bind on him. Once he is immobile, we’ll surround it and beat it up.
A-Are you really a Priest?
Oh, if it isn’t the acquaintances of Lady Dustiness. What a coinciden-.
GOD BLOW!
Hey, penguin, get a hold of yourself! Vanir, are you here!? Your friend lost his life again!
You accursed woman! Do you not feel content without making trouble at my store every day?!
Everytime you revive this pen-pen, one of your lives will be lost as well, right? Then that’s perfect. My boundless divine energy provided to me by my followers or your extra lives that are barely worth 30 eris each, I wonder which of them will be used up first?
Hey, Aqua, don’t tell me the leveling target you were talking about is…
Of course, I’m talking about this pen-pen. He’s weak enough that I can easily vanquish him with a single blow, but I gained a level when I last defeated him. That means that he is worth a lot of experience points. So we’re using him to increase our levels!
Pii!
–P-Please have some tea.
… You sure have some guts to serve me hot water as tea.
W-Wha!? I’m pretty sure I served tea… I-I’ll go rebrew it.
There’s no need to put on another pot, Zereschrute! She’s just messing with you!
Young man, I may be a devil, but even devils can get depressed. Might you listen to a few grumbles of mine…
Seriously, it will really be best for you to get out of this town.
By the way, I don’t see Wiz around. Did she go somewhere?
If you are talking about that delusional shopkeeper, she started talking about strange things like feeling the presence of a challenger and the like after Moi had her work ceaselessly for a week. That doesn’t look good, and we’re in the black after that Treasure Island incident, so Moi had her resting in the back.
By the way, young man, why did you come here today?
Ah.
Hey, do you really intend to raise your level by repeatedly defeating that penguin? The friends I made back in the Crimson Demon village recommended a technique to quickly level by finishing off immobile monsters, and this feels just as unpleasant.
It’s really annoying that it looks so cute. Even if it is a devil, hearing him repeatedly scream does tug at my heartstrings. And here I thought it was a great idea. What should we do now?
Why don’t we just raise our levels like normal? Megumin isn’t here, but we should have raised our skills quite a bit by now. It’s a great chance for us. Normally, we would just let Megumin wipe out the monsters and call it a day right then.
Right, let’s get some practice so we can perform a little better after Megumin’s exhausted her mana.
Frogs! Today is the day we take revenge on the frogs!
No, I don’t wanna! I can’t see frogs as anything other than my natural enemy!
But, Aqua, considering our combat strength, hunting frogs would be the best course of action for us… I’m wearing metal armour, so the frogs won’t eat me. This way, we’ll be able to avoid getting wiped.
That means that the frogs will definitely go after me! I have the ability to learn, you know? This will definitely end with me taking another dip inside a frog’s stomach!
Fine, let’s choose another monster. How about going to the forest a little further away from town? Right now, there should be a lot of monsters that are stocking up in preparation for hibernation. If we go into the forest, I’m sure we’ll be able to catch them while they are eating-
No, I don’t wanna! There are a lot of bug type monsters in the forest. They’ll definitely be attracted by my beautiful aroma and make a beeline for me.
Then how about this? There was that lake that Aqua purified before, right? The crocodiles that were deprived of their habitat should have moved to the nearby wetlands. They should still be near to the lake, so why don’t we go hunt them down and finish off the request from back then…
No, I don’t wanna! You say that, but it’ll just end up with me purifying the wetlands in order to draw out the monsters, right? In that case, the one who ends up attracting all the attention would be me! So I definitely don’t want to go back there!
Hey, I feel like it’s starting to get cold, and there doesn’t seem to be any leveling method more efficient than taking down that penguin. This is getting more and more troublesome.
Oh, you get it too, right? Sounds like Kazuma is getting tired of this too. Then, why don’t we call it a day for today and buy some ingredients for a hot pot on the way back?
Right, let’s just go with the frogs. Darkness, just bring her over to the general area.
I got it, I’ll be leaving the attacking to you. Well, against such huge frogs, even I might occasionally land a hit or two, so look forward to it.
Nooooo! Why is this happening? This isn’t like you at all, Kazuma-san! Normally you would’ve happily agreed with me after I made such a lazy-sounding suggestion!
S-Shut up! Don’t think I’m a man who just lazes around all day! I’m a man who will get things done when he wants to! Stop grumbling and come along!
Kazuma is acting really strange recently! It’s abnormal! It’s like a long time NEET finally got the courage to go to work, and after receiving a little bit of praise on the first day, gets overconfident and starts thinking of himself as a man who get things done! Where did you get that baseless confidence from!? Is it because you kissed Darkness!? Did you cross the precipice of adulthood because you got kissed!?
S-Shut up, Aqua! Please forget about that already! And you, don’t steal glances at me like that! Actually, Kazuma, I can’t see any frogs at all!
Right, Darkness, first, I’ll use my dynamite knock-off to wake up the frogs in the area. Then, you’ll use Decoy to draw the frogs over to you. They’ll gather around you at first, but once they realize that you’re wearing metal armour, they’ll start seeking another target. Their next target should be me, but I’ll take them out with my bow before they reach me.
S-Sure… What’s up with you today? You’re surprisingly bursting with confidence! It’s like a long time virgin entering an adult shop for the first time and, after receiving a little bit of praise, gets overconfident and starts thinking of himself as a man who can get things done…
Shut up! What’s up with you two?! Is it really unusual for me show some confidence?! Dammit, even if Megumin isn’t here to fawn over me, I’ll show you that I’m a man who gets things done! Tinder!
Right, they’re here, Kazuma! The… frogs…
Kazuma! Why are there so many frogs!? And why are they all looking at me!? What’s up with this!?
I told you! I definitely told you! This is why I didn’t want to deal with frogs! These frogs are definitely the creations of devils! Evil creatures they created to take on a goddess like me! WAAAAH! This is why I wanted to go home~!
Shut up! If you don’t want to die, stop crying and start casting some support magic on us! Anyway, it’s really strange for so many of them to appear! They didn’t appear because your bad luck drew them to us, right?
Hey, Kazuma, this is probably because of the Treasure Island! These frogs must have hidden themselves underground in fear of the mana of that divine beast. They must be so afraid of the Treasure Island that they would rather starve themselves than surface, but your magic item woke all of them up.
Apologize! Apologize for blaming it on my bad luck! This whole thing is your idea this time, so take responsibility and do something!
I didn’t expect a single stick of dynamite to attract such large numbers! But I’ll apologize for suspecting you! I’m sorry, so accept your fate and get eaten together! Darkness will survive, so she can save us later!
Nooo! I don’t want to get covered in slime anymore! I don’t want to smell of fish or be defiled anymore~!
Fuhahaha! Bring it!
Sob…sob… I don’t want to go outside anymore… I’ll stay inside for the entire winter…
Come on, I’ll heat up the water for you, so go ahead. I’ll wash up later.
Sob… This whole thing happened because you woke them up with your dynamite, but I really hate myself for forgiving you just because you showed me a bit of kindness…
I’m back.
Thanks. Please wait a while if you want to use the bath, I would like to go in after Aqua’s done… What’s wrong? Why are you staring at me like that…
N-no, it’s nothing. I was just wondering how it feels to be eaten by a frog after seeing everyone get eaten…
Welcome back, Darkness~ The bath is free, Kazuma~. Try not to drink the bathwater I left behind. It might be clean after I’ve purified it, but you might still get a stomach ache if you swallow any leftover frog bits.
Just what kind of man do you think I am, you slimy bitch? I’m still covered in slime, so if you don’t want to be forced to take another bath, you better apologize right now.
I’m sorry, Kazuma. I really don’t want to get slimed again, so please forgive me.
Say, Kazuma, I’m quite tired, so I think I’ll skip dinner today. In place of that, I’ll help myself to some snacks and wine, okay?
Hey, by snacks, you’re not referring to the precious caviar I’ve been keeping, are you? I got that from a strange butler who mixed everything into miso soup back when I was living in the capital!
Megumin really helped us out a lot…
Nah, that’s definitely not possible-
No, wait, if she weren’t here, I would’ve gotten some proper divine treasures or abilities and wouldn’t have died in the first place…
Kyaaaa!
—W-W-What are you thinking!? Why are you screaming instead of me? Isn’t this odd?
I’m not going to be treated as a sexual offender because I happen to chance upon this situation! I firmly believe that if a man stumbles onto this kind of situation by accident, the woman has no right to be angry! I’m the one who was here first! If our sexes were reversed, you’d be the one branded as a sexual offender! Why must the blame always fall upon the guy!? This world is the one that’s screwed up!
I-I get it, you aren’t at fault! I didn’t have any intention to blame you in the first place-
In the first place, why is a woman’s word enough to brand a man as a sexual offender!? Isn’t that odd!? If we were on a train together and you touched my butt, even if I raised a fuss about you being a pervert, no one would even raise an eyebrow!
Hey, wait, why would I touch your butt… what’s a train in the first place?
When I become prime minister, I’ll arrest both men and women equally! I’ll definitely not allow false charges! Cameras will be placed in all carriages, and anyone who makes false charges will be severely punished!
O-Okay, I get it, so please just quiet down a little! What would you do if Aqua comes to investigate!? Actually, what are you even saying!? I’m not following you in the slightest!
But if the pervert is a beautiful lady, there wouldn’t be a crime unless the other party reports it! When I go back to Japan, I plan to run for office with that as my platform-!
… I thought I would wash your back…
Ooh…
Kazuma…
D-Darkness, p-please focus on this part next…
I-I got it…but Kazuma, umm…
Pant, Pant… Darkness, I, I can’t…
Kazuma, I can’t take it anymore, this is…
What are you making such lewd noises when I’m just washing your back!? You are making it sound like we are doing something obscene!
I can’t help it. I thought it was a dream the last time you washed my back, so I didn’t get the chance to properly enjoy it.
That’s scary in its own way. Does that mean you act boldly and do whatever you want to me in your dreams?
Of course, it’s my dream, after all. Did you know? In a dream, no matter what kind of extreme situations you experience, it won’t run afoul of laws or copyrights. A woman I highly respect said that.
Who the hell told you such stupid things!?
Seriously, I’ve been concerned about the company you keep for quite some time. Who is this highly-respected woman? This is the first time I heard that you had such a friend.
She’s a gentle woman who is above you in both personality and body.
That isn’t something you should boldly say when a man and a woman are alone together!
Anyway, what made you think of offering this service in the first place? You’re not seeking some more allowance like Aqua, right? How much money do I have to pay for this service in the future?
Hey, I worked up a lot of courage to do this. Don’t call it a service. This is just thanks for saving Sylphina. I already properly thanked Megumin, Aqua, Vanir, Wiz, and the other adventurers, but I haven’t properly thanked you yet, so…
That’s cold! Can you step further away before splashing water on yourself!? Unlike you, I don’t like getting splashed with cold water after soaking in a warm bath!
I don’t act like that 24/7, you know!? It’s because you keep saying stuff that makes people embarrassed!
H-Hey, are you serious? How far do you intend to go? Is it really okay not to pay an extra fee for this?
Just shut up already! Ah, come on, make sure you properly secure that towel. This isn’t like one of Aqua’s jokes, you hear? I’ll wash your body thoroughly, so stay still.
Okay, okay, I get it. We’ve known each other for some time, after all. I know you’re not entirely satisfied with this.
You don’t get it! You don’t get it at all! Nevermind that, just stay still!
Sigh… I can’t believe I got seriously nervous over this. I feel like such a fool… Hey, I told you not to move! Are you purposely showing it off to me!?
Hey, you aren’t going to say this is the end of it, right? After coming this far while dressed like that, do you really think a healthy young man would be satisfied with just a backrub?
Huh!? But, don’t you have Megumin…
Yeah, things have been going pretty well between Megumin and me lately, but are you fine with that? Are you really fine with that!? Didn’t you say something like ‘Ah, it seems I like you more than I thought’ to me a few days ago?!
I-I said that, but…
I was really happy back then.
That’s…
I was really happy when you told me that. Yeah, I did reject you, but men are troublesome creatures, you see. We’ll still feel a little disappointed if the other party obediently gives up just because we rejected them once. But this is the case for you women as well, right?
T-That means, instead of Megumin, you…
Ah, that’s impossible. I’m a pretty faithful man. Now that we’ve progressed to this point, there’s no way I can leap into the arms of another woman. I’m aiming to be a decent man, after all.
Wait, hold on, you’ve already chosen Megumin, but if we keep going like this, won’t we end up in an extremely risque situation…?
Is this too difficult for you to follow? Very well, I’ll put it in simpler terms. I want to become a proper, decent man. But it’s not like I can’t understand your feelings of love that are so overwhelming that you just can’t restrain yourself anymore.
It’s not like I like you to that extent… No, it’s nothing.
Basically, this is what I’m saying. I’ll definitely resist you if you try and get me to cheat on Megumin. I’ll resist, but be it be my level or stats, there’s no way I can successfully fight you off if you were to do anything lewd to me. But I’m the Kazuma-san who highly values my companions. No matter what you do, I won’t hate you because of it.
W-W-What are you saying!? People call you Kazutrash or Scumzuma, but that doesn’t even begin to describe you! Why did Megumin fall for such a man!?
S-Shut up! You were saying you liked that sort of man too! In the first place, there’s no way for a healthy man to resist after being flung into these kinds of erotic situations one after another! If anything, you should be praising me for not having crossed the line up till this point!
Who would praise you for that!? How stupid! Ah, nevermind, I was the fool! I’m feeling unwell today, so you can handle the rest on your own!
Oh, you’re leaving now? You haven’t even finished washing my front yet! What kind of thanks is this!? You keep saying that I’m gutless, but you’re pretty gutless yourself, aren’t you?! What was it, a member of the Dustiness family will never yield? Don’t you dare flatter yourself with such words!
Fine, I’ll wash you! But that will be it! I won’t go any further! I’m not that easy of a woman that I’ll fall for your cheap provocations!
Enough with the words, hurry up and get to it! That is, if you have the resolve to go through with it! Aqua’s dead drunk after eating my high quality snacks and Megumin’s in the Crimson Demon village! In other words, there’s no one left to interfere! Don’t think someone will conveniently barge in just like what happened the last time.
Hey, that hurts! If you want to thank me, then be more gentle!
You really complain a lot for a man! I’m just going to hurry up and get this over with!
Can’t you do something about that?! I can’t help but be bothered when I see your towel rise like that!
That’s just a little party trick. I took out a few frogs earlier, didn’t I? I gained a couple of levels and learnt the party trick skill.
As if there exist such a useless trick! Seriously, what kind of man are you… You really aren’t a match for the pure and straightforward Megumin! Hurry up and break up!
Too bad, Megumin’s already head over heels for me! Who in hell would listen to you!? I think I’ll go find Megumin when she gets back and have her properly pamper me!
You really are the lowest form of trash… Oh, I know. I should’ve done this from the start.
I’ll make something happen between us before telling Megumin exactly what happened. I’ll let her understand exactly how weak of a man you are and make her give up on you. It wouldn’t hurt Megumin if she gradually gives up on you of her own volition. If you can escape from my clutches, I’ll accept that you are a fitting man for Megumin!
I-Megumin… Don’t think it’ll go exactly as you planned! Let go of me!
You say that, but you aren’t using any skills or resisting at all! You’re actually looking forward to this, aren’t you? Now, I’m sure you know what comes next…
Just what exactly comes next?
Help me! This woman barged into the bath to attack me!
Y-You bastard! You really are the trashiest of men!
Then, Darkness said ‘…Ah, it seems I like you more than I thought…'
Kyaa!
T-Then? What happened next? How did you respond, Kazuma-san?
I responded… ‘Sorry, I already have Megumin. You should give up on me.’
Kyaaa!
Wait, hold on! You and Megumin are an item!? When did you become this popular!?
It’s only natural, after all, it’s me we’re talking about! The one who defeated many strong enemies and even got featured in a special article in the newspapers! Here, take a look!
… Hey, isn’t this the newspaper published in the capital?
Why would Kazuma-kun appear in that?
Why are you two so quiet? What, do you guys think that I’ve become unreachable because I’ve become a celebrity? Don’t worry, I don’t plan on leaving this town anytime soon. We’re friends, aren’t we? You can just casually call me Kazuma…
No, I don’t really care about that.
Yeah, that thought hasn’t crossed my mind at all.
Then why are you acting like this? Are you envious of me now that I’m featured in the news?
You’ll be targeted by other famous adventurers, you know?
—So, yeah, a couple of adventurers I know told me that, but it’ll be fine, right? They won’t attack me or anything, will they? In the first place, a sudden assault is a crime, right?
Y-You… You used the authority of my house for all kinds of frivolous matters again… Hey, where do you think you’re going, Megumin?! I’m lecturing the both of you!
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, please give me that article. Look at this, I’m described as the beautiful, blue-haired Archpriest.
I don’t want to, I want to keep a copy of my own special article too. Look, my introduction is the ‘strongest of the weakest class’. It really tickles my chuuni soul. Nevermind that, Darkness, it’ll be fine, right? The security of this town is good, right? If some rough-looking adventurers start spouting dangerous things, the police will cart them off, right?
Duels between adventurers are allowed by the Adventurer’s Guild. You fought with that magic sword user some time ago, remember? Anyway, even in the worst case scenario, Aqua can-
Revive me even if I die!? Don’t joke with me!
Don’t worry, Kazuma. I’ll deal with any adventurers who come seeking a challenge, so you can rest assured and continue boasting as you wish.
Don’t spoil this man, Megumin! I feel like you’ve been excessively overprotective of him lately. Just what happened!?
What happened? You dare ask me that?
Ah…
It’s because someone had an affair and stole the first kiss of the man in my heart!
A-Affair!? Megumin, don’t make it sound so obscene…
I thought you were a sheltered young lady, so I let you confess your feelings and settle things out of the goodness of my heart, but you! You aren’t satisfied by just confessing! Last night, too, you tried to seduce my man with that erotic body of yours!
I-I didn’t try to seduce… Hey, Kazuma, you say something too!
Kazuma-san, you’ve changed! You are no longer the virgin NEET who had to rely on me to get through life! Since when did you become a harem protagonist?!
Aqua, listen closely. There’s no such thing as simple friendship between a girl and a guy. Even if it starts out as such, eventually they’ll start becoming conscious of each other in a romantic way. And if a rich and talented and reliable man with a secure future like me is hanging around them… Yes, this is but the natural result.
This guy is saying something strange again. Still, even though we’ve been together for quite some time, for some strange reason, I have never once regarded Kazuma-san in a romantic manner.
What a coincidence, I feel the same way. Every other girl I’ve been with has made my heart skip a beat at least once or twice, but you…
And what’s with the clothes you’ve been wearing within the mansion recently?! They are so thin that you might as well be a woman of the night! Do you really want to show off your body to Kazuma that badly?! You do, don’t you?! Every time you take a bath, you always hang out close to Kazuma for no apparent reason!
T-That’s not it… I-It’s because it’s getting hot!
It’s almost winter!
And you purposefully wear these kinds of clothes in front of him! Kazuma is a weak-willed man, so I definitely won’t allow you to tempt him like this!
I’m not trying to tempt him- Ow, ow, ow! Don’t pull on me, Megumin! You’ll rip my sleeping gown-
You’re wide open!
Grah!
I defeated the harem NEET!
What’s wrong with this little one? If she wants to go out, she would normally just jump over to the window and start pawing at it.
Ouch… Did you see something unspeakable? Is there a ghost over there or something?
Ah, hey, why are there so many stray ghosts in the city? I’ve been regularly cleansing the cemetery, so why are there so many of them here?
… Hey, don’t think I’m at fault just because ghosts are involved. I really have nothing to do with this! These ghosts aren’t naturally occuring, someone summoned them here!
I let her off because she serves me tea and snacks whenever I visit her store, but it seems like she’s finally shown her true colours! I’ve already taken a bath and changed into my pajamas, so I don’t feel like going out today, but I’ll go out early next morning to lecture her!
Is anyone here!?
… If it isn’t the lonely woman who raises such a fuss so early in the morning. What business do you have with my store? Moi is a little busy right now, so if you’re here for something pointless, please come back at another time.
I came here to settle the score with Wiz after she summoned all those ghosts, but where is she? Actually, what do you mean by lonely woman? If you’re praising the great Aqua-sama for standing alone above everyone else, I wouldn’t mind praying for you to be reborn as a paramecium instead of a devil when you finally run out of lives.
Moi is calling you lonely woman because even the easily-seduced harem brat wouldn’t fall for you… H-Hey, Moi is always ready to accept a challenge from you, but didn’t we agree not to turn the merchandise in this store into water!?
Say, Vanir, where did Wiz go? We have something to discuss with her.
That prodigal storekeeper hasn’t been back since she left sometime last night. She has never had much luck with men, so it’d be a good thing if she found a nice guy to spend the night with.
Wait, you’re kidding, right!? She looks so mature, so how could she spend the night at a guy’s place like this!? First Kazuma and now her, everyone’s turning into a pervert!
Vanir-san, please help me-
Turn Undead!
Hyaaaa-!
What the hell do you think you are doing!? You really did a number on Wiz this time!
Calm down, you perverted NEET. This is just a little light punishment for summoning all those ghosts last night.
You finally came back. Just where did you fool around, you promiscuous storekeeper? Didn’t Moi tell you that there are new goods coming in early this morning?
Yeah, that’s it! You have the face of a cake that no man would take, so why did you suddenly start spending the night out? Judging from your personality, I’m sure you got tricked by some bad man! Someone like Kazuma-san!
H-Hold on, you two! Why am I suddenly getting purified!? And why are the two of you saying such despicable things about me on top of that!?
Just ignore them. Anyway, what’s wrong? You seem to be in quite a panic.
I ran into a stalker!
—Here, drink some hot tea and calm down. It’s best to warm yourself after experiencing something scary.
T-thank you, Aqua-sama… But this tea makes me go numb whenever I drink it…
So, what exactly happened? What’s this about a stalker?
Yes, a stalker! This happened yesterday evening…
Without removing his hood, the black robed man said: ‘My name is Duke. I’ve come from a faraway place to meet you… I’ve spent many years investigating you, and throughout all this time, my only thoughts are of you.’
He then said: ‘I’ve done nothing but train my body. Do you know why?’ Of course, I said I didn’t know, but then-!
He screamed: ‘It’s obviously so I can take you over!’ And threw away his robe. I quickly ran away… Afterwards, I was too afraid to return to the store, so I summoned a few ghosts and asked them to monitor the stalker’s movements…
I see, so that’s why the ghosts started gathering in this town. Ah well, guess it can’t be helped. Make sure you send them back to where they came from after this.
They aren’t stray dogs, Aqua. Actually, couldn’t you just send them to heaven right now? So, anyway, was the reason you didn’t come back until now because the stalker was hanging out near the store?
No, I don’t know where he is. I released a lot of ghosts into this city, but I couldn’t get a fix on him at all… Actually, it seems like most of the ghosts were exorcised by him…
So the culprit is an Axis Cultist?
Indeed, there’s no need to use Moi all-seeing eyes to determine that.
Hey, hold on! Don’t turn my precious children into scapegoats!
Umm… Can you help me think of some countermeasures…?
But, we don’t even know where the black-robed stalker is right now, right? Hey, don’t you constantly boast about your all-seeing eyes? Why aren’t you putting them to use right now?
Moi does not need you to tell me that! Moi have been using my powers on him for quite some time, but Moi still can’t get a lock on him. It doesn’t seem like he’s an ordinary pervert. There’s a high chance that he is strong enough to fend off Moi all-seeing eyes.
Unmarriageable Shopkeeper, perhaps you should change your way of thinking. It’s not often that you find someone who’s so madly obsessed with you. It might not be such a bad idea for you to get together with him, you know?
H-How could I!? He’s a man who would attack someone on sight! And please don’t call me Unmarriageable Shopkeeper.
Is Wiz-san here? There’s a letter for you.
Ah, thank you.
It’s a letter from that stalker, yes? Moi may be able to find out where he is if Moi uses my powers upon that letter. Do you want me to launch an attack on him?
Thank you, Vanir-san, but I’ll settle this by myself. This letter is calling me to meet with him outside town tomorrow.
I… This is the first time someone confessed to me, so I would like to seriously answer him.
–So, Wiz intends to give him her answer tomorrow.
A stalker, huh. My self-proclaimed rival seems like she might lean a little in that direction, so I’m a little worried about her future… These kinds of people are really scary when they become desperate. There’s no telling what they’ll do when they snap.
Still, to think that such a pervert would appear in this peaceful city… How could he cause trouble for the upstanding citizens of this town?
… I didn’t think the day would come when I could hear the word pervert come out of your mouth.
W-What are you-!?
Wiz said she’ll settle it herself, but what exactly does that pacifistic girl plan to do? Does she seriously intend to accept his confession? Megumin and Darkness have been obsessed with perverted thoughts lately. If Wiz gets a boyfriend too, wouldn’t the number of playmates I have be drastically reduced?
Hey, Aqua, I’m not obsessed with perverted thoughts! I’m not like Darkness who dresses like a woman of the night to seduce men! I’m a pure maiden who hasn’t even kissed a man yet!
Hey…!
Hey, Kazuma-san? You have a really evil look on your face. What’s wrong?
At least say this is the manly face of a guy protecting his friend!
Hey Kazuma, now’s not the time to ogle her! Hurry up and activate Lurk.
Hey, Kazuma, I feel like a stalker somehow. At this rate, will we end up becoming her second and third stalker?
Don’t say that, Aqua. This isn’t stalking, this is simply keeping watch over a friend who might be heading into danger from afar.
We call that ‘stalking’.
Seems like you read my letter. I’m glad that you accepted my request.
… After hearing you say that to me, there’s no way I wouldn’t be here…
It has been too long… I’ve been searching for you for a long time. It really surprised me to hear that you opened a magic item shop in this town. But I’ve finally met you. This made it worth spending all the time on the road to get here.
D-Did you really travel such a long distance just to meet with me?
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, don’t just listen for yourself. Interpret for us too. What are the two of them saying?
I’m only listening in with my Lip Reading skill, so this is just my interpretation, but… It seems like that man traveled a long distance in order to confess to Wiz.
Eh!?
I’m sure you know why I called you out here. Just as I said the other day… I’ve always been thinking about you. I’ve trained my body so that I’ll be a worthy fit for you!
E-Even if you say that… And this is our first meeting, I don’t even know how to respond! And I don’t think it’s good to boldly perform such actions in the middle of town!
Hey, Kazuma! Wiz seems to be blushing! Just what did that guy say?
He said ‘I’ve always been thinking of you,’ ‘I’ve trained myself just for you,’ and stuff like that. He seems to be the kind of guy who thinks that being strong will make him popular with the ladies.
It’s pretty much their first meeting! How passionate of him!
Yes, now that I think about it, it might have been a bit too hasty of me to do that in the middle of town. I chose a deserted alley, but…
Just because nobody is there to see it doesn’t make it okay! That sort of thing should wait till we know each other better…!
… I see. Yes, it is indeed a little unfair only for me to know about you. Seems like there’s a need for me to say a little about myself…
Y-Yeah. After all, I don’t even know your name…
My name is Duke. My specialty is fire-aligned Advanced Magic. It’s the complete opposite of you, who specializes in ice-aligned magic.
Y-You don’t even intend to hide our lack of compatibility, I see. I’m quite fond of honest men, but… To think that you even know about that…
Of course! You were known as the Ice Witch back when you were still human, after all.
W-Wait, you know that I’m not human!?
Hey, Kazuma, don’t stop interpreting! Wiz seems surprised, just what happened!?
He knows that Wiz is a Lich, as well as the types of spells she specializes in. He really did his homework. Seems like he’s quite serious about her.
He’s not just a regular stalker, but an extreme pervert!
For the sake of the world and all of its inhabitants, it might be better to just evacuate Wiz and blow him up with Explosion right here!
I know everything about you! You could say that I am the man who understands you best in this world! Now, I’ve told you about myself, so let’s get back to the original topic!
W-W-Wait! I’m not emotionally prepared yet! D-Does that mean that you traveled all the way here even after learning that I’m undead? Aren’t you afraid of me?
Are you making fun of me? What’s so scary about a Lich?
T-That’s… If you put it that way…
Hey, this is bad! I think Wiz has been moved! That bastard said something like ‘Who cares if you are an undead!? I’m not afraid of a lich!'
He doesn’t care even though she’s a being hailed as the King of Undead… This is true love! W-What should I do, Kazuma!? I feel like I really want to support that man!
What are you saying!? Saying undead can be loved too is nothing short of blasphemy! Sure, Wiz is cooling and it’s comfortable to sleep while holding onto her in the summer, but that girl is just a moving corpse! Holding feelings of love towards a corpse, just how depraved is he!?
W-Well, calling her a moving corpse isn’t exactly wrong, but… Don’t ever say that in front of her, Aqua. She’ll cry.
Now, that’s enough talk! Ice Witch, let’s have a duel!
Ehh? W-Where did that come from!?
Why? Isn’t that obvious? It’s to demonstrate my power to you and have you give up your current job!
Eeeeh!?
Kazuma, come on, interpret for us! What happened!? What did they say!?
That bastard challenged Wiz to a duel. If he wins, he wants Wiz to quit her job.
Wiz’s job is as the storekeeper of her store, right? And… she used to regularly accept jobs from the real estate agent to exorcise the undead in the graveyard and the surrounding houses, right?!
Is he telling the one he loves to stop taking on dangerous work? Seems like he doesn’t know that the job of managing the cemetery has already been transferred over to Aqua. Still, this is…
Y-You want me to marry you…
Leave your work to me! Then, let’s do this, you-!
Teleport!
Wiz didn’t come back today either. There’s nowhere for me to play now. I’m really bored~
A sudden proposal is really too tough for a person inexperienced with love to deal with. The matter of romance really is complex. Even one as popular as I hasn’t grasped all of its intricacies.
You know, you’re still a virgin NEET. Don’t let it get to your head just because you’ve become slightly more popular.
I’m going out for dinner, so you don’t need to make my share. I’ll probably be staying out tonight.
Say, you occasionally stay out for the night, but where do you go? If you’re going drinking, I would really like it if you could take me with you.
I’m having a drink with the guys, so sorry, no can do. I’ll give you some allowance, so go buy some good wine and share it with everyone.
How wonderful, Kazuma-san! I’ll properly watch over the house while you’re gone!
—Hey, Kazuma, what’s wrong? You’ve been staring at that guy for some time now. Do you know him?
No, it’s not like we know each other…
Oh, I haven’t seen your pretty face around before. My name is Dust. I’m a little famous around these parts.
… Why did you suddenly come here for? Do you have some business with me?
I already named myself, so shouldn’t you name yourself too? Don’t you know what courtesy is? Eh?
… My name is Duke. I’ll ask again, do you have some business with me?
You’re a new adventurer here, right? I just said it, but I’m a little famous around these parts. It’ll save you a lot of trouble down the road if you treat me to a drink.
Ho, you wish to extort money from me? … I see, there really are all kinds of folks out there. It’s not often I experience something so interesting.
Heh, you passed. Yes, that’s how adventurers should be. For us, it’s all over if we get looked down upon. That’s why I frequently call out to newbie adventurers like this. If they are the kind of cowards who honestly fork over the money, I’ll tell them that they aren’t suited to be an adventurer and go back to their mother. And for someone like you, how about a drink?
… Is that so? You’re quite interesting indeed.
Hey, Kazuma, what the hell is he?! If you knew he was such a dangerous person, you should’ve told me! I ended up having to treat him to a drink!
Y-You… Anyway, how strong do you think he is?
That guy is dangerous. He’s head and shoulders above anyone else I’ve faced. You could say he’s on the same level as a Demon King’s General or a high bounty target.
So… you’re saying that he’s strong enough to tangle with me.
– Hey, do you have a moment? My name is Satou, yes, the one hailed as the strongest adventurer in this town, Satou Kazuma.
Here comes another stran… Satou? Satou Kazuma?! That Satou Kazuma?!
Yes, I’m that Satou Kazuma. The one who took down many high bounty targets and Demon King’s Generals-
The Satou Kazuma who simply gives orders to his companions and holds very little power himself!? The very same Kazuma who would lose in a fight with Kobolds!?
I see, it’s just as the rumours said. I can definitely feel the aura of a small fry from you. The reports of the Demon King’s Generals falling one after another to a party operating under the orders of a NEET must be mistaken somehow…
Hey, are you picking a fight?
…Hmph, I came to this town for a woman, but… Very well, I originally wanted to wait till my business with her is concluded, but there really is no reason to wait. I might as well take care of you right now.
Don’t make it sound like you’re taking care of a small errand while out buying dinner. What, you want to go? I’m stronger than you think. I didn’t just bumble my way into taking out all those Demon King’s Generals! And I have the backing of the great noble house of Dustiness! You’ll regret it if you carelessly pick a fight with me! And I have a lot of strong friends too!
… Hmph, right now there’s a person that I need to give my fullest attentions to, so I’ll let you go for today.
I-I’m a man who’ll get things done when he needs to! People call me Kazuma-san who becomes really strong when he gets serious! It’s just, I’ll get serious tomorrow!
So I’ll let you…
Say, that person you need to give your fullest attention to… you’re talking about Wiz, right?
How do you know that? What’s your relationship with Wiz?
C-C-Calm down! Please calm down! I’m a friend of Wiz! She’ll definitely be torn up if you kill me!
… I don’t know how much you know about Wiz, but you shouldn’t get too close to that girl. She isn’t someone a small fry like you can handle.
I know that you’re aiming for Wiz. Actually, I’m willing to support you.
What did you say?
… Weren’t you a friend of Wiz?
It’s precisely because I’m her friend. I don’t think she’s very well suited for her current job. And…
Even if she is a Lich, she has the right to seek her own happiness. I’m thinking that it’d be nice for her to retire and live a happy life afterwards.
… You still continue to associate with her even after knowing she’s a Lich. Seems like I need to revise my assessment of you.
I’m of the same mind. I too do not think she’s particularly suited for her current job. It may have been a different matter back when she was still being hailed as the Ice Witch, but her current state is just too pitiful.
Well, she was a pretty famous adventurer in the past. She might’ve been a little more capable back then than she is currently…
Still, you should stop trying to seek a fight with her. Couldn’t you peacefully talk things out and get her to give up her job that way?
…? What are you saying? There’s no meaning in doing things that way. In order to take over for her, I need to prove my strength.
Say, can I ask something? Um… Do you intend to take on all of Wiz’s current responsibilities?
Of course! There’s no better person fit for her job than me! After doing so, I’ll definitely turn this sorry state of affairs around.
Wait, isn’t there a serious obstacle standing in the way of that? If you know so much about Wiz, I’m sure you know about Vanir too, right? It’ll be one thing if you are just getting Wiz to give up her place, but if you wish to replace her afterwards, I don’t think he’ll accept that.
Hmm, Vanir-dono, huh… True, he will be most troublesome, but this is between Wiz and me. Even if it’s Vanir-dono, I can’t afford to back down!
Even if you say that, he’ll definitely get in the way. However…
I don’t dislike guys like you…
Thus, I’ve decided to support him.
I don’t really get what you’re saying.
Like I said, that Duke might be a little stubborn, but I feel like he’s a very manly person and, overall, isn’t a bad guy.
… Well, as far as I’m concerned, it’s a good thing for the women around Kazuma to get hitched, so I don’t really mind…
Ho? You were referring to me as ‘your man’ earlier, but you’re still worried about that? You have a pretty cute side, don’t you?
…I don’t know what you’re trying to do, but that act is giving me the creeps, so please drop it.
Are you really fine with letting a man with such an unclear background take Wiz away? Knowing your personality, I was expecting you to say something like ‘Megumin and Darkness aren’t enough, Wiz, Yunyun, Iris, Eris, Chris, and Komekko are all mine!'
Just what kind of man do you thin… Hey, hold on, isn’t that last one a bit strange!? Even I have a line I won’t cross, you know!? I’ve said it many times, and I’ll say it again: I’m not a lolicon!
I’ve really changed my opinion of you, Kazuma! Yes, that man’s love is a very precious thing indeed! He loves her even if she is a Lich! Yes, he cannot even be compared to a certain weak man who can’t even resist a little bit of seduction…!
Hey, are you referring to me? You’re the one who seduced me in the first place!
Kazuma, I’ll help you! All we have to do is to stop Vanir from getting between the two, right? Just tell me what to do!
Both of you, calm down. First we need to confirm how they feel towards each other, right? Unless you are a mature adult who’s well versed with matters of romance like me, most women will become flustered in the face of Duke’s passionate pleas. In the first place, Wiz is still missing. Things can’t exactly progress when one of the parties isn’t here.
Since when did you become a mature woman who’s well versed with matters of romance, you little brat? The only person that can be described as mature here is an experienced man like me.
… Then, shall I show you what a mature woman I am? I’ll be heading over to your room tonight.
No, I’m not in the mood for such stuff tonight. I just saw what it means to be a real man yesterday. It’ll be some time before I fall for your tricks again, nor will I be lured in by your somewhat lacking sex appeal.
Huh?
What? Did you think I’m a simple man who’s raring to go at any time?
Err, no… It’s just… I thought things were going well between us, so I was sure you would go for it…
Right now, Kazuma won’t be moved by anything you say. He spent the night outside yesterday, right? You see, whenever he spends the night outside-
Aqua, what happened to the allowance I gave you yesterday? Did you spend it already? How did the wine taste?
The wine was quite delicious, but why are you dragging me off? Wait, I haven’t eaten my dessert yet! Where are you taking me? Stop! Darkness, Megumin, in this town, there are succ-!
I’ll give you some allowance today, so come with me for a bit! I have something very important to discuss with you!
Say, Kazuma, can’t you say something to them? Farm work isn’t easy. Every year, some Matsutake and Bamboo farmers always end up going missing.
I know farmers have it tough. There are typhoons in my country, and every year, a few farmers end up going missing during the typhoon season. But they won’t listen to anything I say, so what can I do?
You have typhoons where you come from too, huh? Yeah, the vegetables do get agitated during typhoon season…
Kazuma, come take a look! They’ve already started sprouting!
The eyes of the mackerel are also showing. They are a little grotesque to look at, but you should still take a look.
Say, Darkness, don’t you think it’s odd to catch watermelons in the sea and harvest mackerel in the fields?
Why would it be odd? You say some really strange things sometimes.
Ah!
Pik!
I’m sure I told you that I’ll purify you if I see you outside. You sure have some guts coming here. Very well, that strange devil isn’t here to interfere, so I’ll send you to heaven right now.
No, please wait! There’s a reason why I came here. Vanir-sama and Storekeeper-dono are…
Wiz! You’re back! Everyone was worried about you!
Vanir-san, you idiot! That tactless part of you hasn’t changed in the slightest!
You shouldn’t expect any tact from devils in the first place, you foolish storekeeper! You’ve become a lovestruck fool after fooling around outside! If you want to get married, then just get to it!
Are you really fine with that!? I’m going to get married, you know?! I won’t be able to come back to this store after that! The owner is going to change! Aren’t contracts supposed to be absolute to a devil!? What happened to the contract we had to make this shop prosper together!?
Left-on-the-shelf shopkeeper, after you leave the store and the new storekeeper takes over, Moi will just make the store prosper with him and gain the funds to construct my dungeon that way! So just relax and go get married, you lovestruck shopkeeper!
Why you!
What the hell is going on?
Vanir-sama and Storekeeper-dono have been like this for quite some time. I thought Storekeeper-dono finally came back, but she seems to have her head in the clouds and ended up getting angry at Vanir-sama. I can’t find a way to stop them, so I thought to seek your help, young man.
Hey, Wiz, where have you been!? You really worried everyone, you know! Hurry up and apologize!
Aqua, they are a little preoccupied right now. Getting in there will just complicate things, so just stay with me in this corner for now.
In the first place, what are the two of you fighting about? Come on, even Count Zereshrute is troubled.
Listen to this, Darkness! I’ve been wandering around the deepest levels of what is said to be the world’s largest dungeon for the past few days. I’ve been killing monsters while thinking about things.
That man… That Duke-san who suddenly appeared and said that he’d be willing to accept all of me… Why is he so passionate about me…
I mean, I’m a Lich, you know? But even then, he said that he doesn’t care. He even said, ‘Even after turning into an undead, you’re beautiful. I like you just the way you are…’
I was watching from afar using Lip-Reading, but did he actually say that?
And he proposed to me on our very first meeting… He even told me that ‘Such a beautiful flower isn’t suited for such dangerous work. I’ll protect you from now on, so…’
He didn’t say that.
Kazuma-san, I’m talking about very important matters right now, so please be quiet… Even though he proposed to me, I still have the contract with Vanir and my store to look after… Aah, what should I do…
She’s been that way ever since she came back. Moi told her that if she wants to continue being a storekeeper, she should stop running away from the store and work properly, and if you want to get married, then do as you will, but for some reason she got mad after that.
Can’t you treat me with more care?! Is that all our relationship is worth? Aren’t Vanir-san and I partners who teamed up to make both our dreams come true?
A contract is absolute to a devil, but… Even Moi has been on the verge of breaking down in the face of your haplessness… Moi has been thinking if I should take a little break in our contract-
I won’t let you give up on our contract! I know very well that this store would’ve long since closed down if Vanir-san wasn’t here. B-But, the only person who can make the world’s largest dungeon would be me. Are you really fine with giving up on your dream of facing down adventurers at the bottom of the world’s toughest dungeon, Vanir-san?!
So, are you willing to get together with him? Or is he not your type?
That man doesn’t look too bad, and he seems pretty devoted to me… But, you know, I have a duty to see Vanir’s dream realized…
As far as Moi is concerned, Moi doesn’t really care who the storekeeper is. All Moi needs from you is for you to build the dungeon after Moi acquired the required funds.
Is Vanir-san a tsundere?! There’s way too much tsun and not enough dere! Please at least care a little more about me! Haven’t we known each other for a long time? Are you really fine with me leaving with that man!?
It’s quite troubling to call the genderless Moi a tsundere… Okay, okay, fine, Moi will put a little more effort into my all-seeing gaze this time. Moi will go chase him away if Moi sees anything too horrible about him, are you happy now?
Ho… He is in sight. The man who is so obsessed with you is currently busy collecting information about you in town.
… Hmm? Oh, my, this is… How wonderful! This truly is wonderful! Moi wondered why he was so difficult to see, so this is why!
W-What is it, Vanir-san? What’s so wonderful about him? It’s really rare to see you praise someone so wholeheartedly.
The devil who sees through all so declares! When you respond to that man’s feelings, a man will experience delight and merriment to a degree never before seen in this world.
Still, to think that Vanir would accept that man so easily… As expected of the man I acknowledged…
Why is this man so enamoured with that stalker, I wonder… Well, compared to a certain person who’ll go have fun with some female adventurers the moment you take your eyes off him and find excuses to fool around in the bath after just a little seduction, his devotion is pretty respectable…
Yeah, unlike a certain someone, he seems pretty devoted to the woman he wishes to live together with. W-Well, being unfaithful is one of the hallmarks of a trashy man, so I don’t dislike it…
What? Yeah, the bath incident was my bad! But if you don’t mind me saying, you guys were at fault too! Megumin keeps sending me all kinds of hints but never crosses the line, and Darkness keeps flaunting her needlessly erotic body but always gets embarrassed and chickens out-
This guy has started throwing away the last shreds of his dignity!
You really have been turning into the type of man that I used to consider my ideal as of late…
I won’t accept this. I won’t accept a man with such an unknown background! Isn’t it odd? This is Wiz we are talking about! Why is he so obsessed with her? He must definitely be up to no good! This is a goddess’s intuition! That man is definitely not in love with Wiz!
You just don’t want to lose the only friend you can have tea with, right?
Well, yes, but I still have a bad feeling about this! It’s hard to put it in words, but I feel like this will end with someone I really hate getting really really happy…
Even so, now that Wiz seems like she’s into it, it’s not really our place to interfere. If you wish for her happiness, you should just let things take their course…
… I’ll test that man.
What do you mean by test? What exactly are you planning to do?
I’m going to test if that man is truly a devoted and earnest man. Yes, I’ll seduce him.
A-Are you insane? You don’t even know the first thing about romance, and you want to seduce that man? Are you serious?
Who do you think I am? I’m the goddess with ten million devotees of the Axis Cult, the extremely popular Aqua-sama! I’m well-loved by the neighbourhood kids, and even an old man gave me sweets recently. If I give these two a little bit of instruction, that man will easily fall before us.
After all, we have the Loli Killer who is extremely seductive towards anyone whose preferences leans that way, and Eroness who can take care of anyone who appreciates a more lewd figure. If he can avoid being led astray by the seductions of these two, I’ll acknowledge him.
Wait, is that Loli Killer me? I won’t do something so stupid! Even if it is to test that man’s devotion, I am a devoted and principled woman too! I already have Kazuma, so I’m not seducing anyone else!
Stop making it sound like I’m in charge of all things lewd! I feel like the way you guys are treating me is getting worse by the day! I’m a little bit angry at myself for enjoying that kind of treatment…
Those two are inexperienced with matters of romance, but I’ll properly instruct them, so don’t worry! Just watch, I’ll prove that my intuition wasn’t wrong!
I’m not doing it, okay? I’ll definitely not do it! Are you listening to me, Aqua!?
May I sit next to you?
… If you’re here to solicit me, I’m not interested.
Hey, Aqua, she dressed up and put on makeup and everything, only to end up getting mistaken for a prostitute and dismissed… pfft.
Don’t laugh, Kazuma, we’ll be discovered… pfft.
She got all fired up and said that all nobles are well -versed in the art of cajoling men and what not when I told her that it was impossible for her… Hahaha.
‘Very well, this is for Wiz’s sake. I’ll show you the glamour of a noble lady.’ she said. Ah, she was really cool back then.
You are really funny. I’m not a woman of the night. I’m an owner of a small store here in Axel; the name is Lalati-
Hey, isn’t that Darkness? What are you doing here with a dress like that? This isn’t a shop fit for nobility, you know? Hey, Lady of the Dustiness house, now that you’re here, why don’t you treat me to a drink?
… Have you mistaken me for someone else? I am-
What are you talking about, Lalatina? It’s me, Dust! We’ve adventured together and gone through a lot of other stuff too! Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten about that!
… There are always such people who come up to pester you after claiming to have met you somewhere before, aren’t there?
So, what does the Lady of the Dustiness family want with me?
Seemed like I pushed my joke a little too far. I’ll introduce myself once again. My name is Dustiness ford Lalatina, the daughter of the Lord of this town and an adventurer.
Please give this man and I a glass of the best red wine in this bar.
There’s no way such a cheap bar like mine would serve red wine, Dustiness-sama.
Don’t laugh, Kazuma! It can’t be helped! Darkness is a noble lady, so she doesn’t frequent such stores!
Then why are you laughing!? Don’t do that, I won’t be able hold it in either!
Then, just give me the most expensive item in this store…
A barrel of ice -cold Crimson beer, right? Thank you for your patronage!
… Wow, can you really drink this much?
… I thought I would treat everyone in this bar to a drink to celebrate our meeting…
I won’t ever do something like this again! Damn you Duke, how dare you embarrass a noble like me so!
You brought it all on by yourself. Duke didn’t do anything… Pfft!
Hey Kazuma, Darkness didn’t catch his interest even after everything she did! If you laugh at her too, it’d be way too pitiful! Darkness, I think you did pretty well. Especially that line about celebrating our meeting and starting a drinking party! If someone said that to me, I’d definitely show them one of my special party tricks.
AAAAAAH!
But that man, he wasn’t swayed at all by my seduction or my status… I didn’t misjudge him. He’s completely different from a certain easily seduced someone. He’s gained a little more of my respect…
So, Kazuma, did you experience the glamour of a noble lady?
Sadly, I did not. That was the supposed art of cajoling men that all nobles are well -versed in. Was it helpful for you?
I’ll fucking kill you!
Idiot, you went too far! She is really angry now!
Waaah! You were the one who made her snap, so you do something about this!
I’m not angry at either one of you, but both of you! You’ll just make things worse if you run! I’ll teach the two of you a good lesson before we return to the mansion!
So you dare shamelessly walk back in, you runaway NEET! Darkness ground my temples into dust yesterday, you know?
Nevermind me, isn’t there something strange growing in your field?
Don’t try and change the subject. I sacrificed myself to soothe Darkness’s anger in your place, so show some more gratitude to me.
Hey, did you actually plant a mandrake here? It’ll become a really big problem if it starts screaming in the middle of town, you know? Didn’t you say you will wait till next year to plant mandrakes?
The seeds were cheap, so I bought them, but it shouldn’t have sprouted so soon. Still, just what is this girl? I feel like I’ve seen her somewhere before. Only plant-type monsters would grow so rapidly, but…
Hey, isn’t this a Tranquility Girl?! Why the hell did you plant one here?!
W-Wait, I just planted the seeds that the traveling salesman sold me! He was selling the seeds really cheaply too! There’s no way such a kind man would sell me a monster seed!
The seeds are cheapbecauseit’s a monster seed! Are you not satisfied with buying a chicken egg in place of a dragon’s egg!? Now you want to raise a useless monster too!?
Emperor Zell isn’t a chicken! Anyway, what should we do with this girl? Darkness will definitely get angry if she learns that we planted a monster!
… Good morning, Kazuma. So you dare shamelessly walk back in, huh?
Kazuma, Darkness is coming this way! Do something about this kid!
Well, I don’t really care if that Tranquility Girl gets killed…
You devil! You really are a devil NEET! Don’t you feel anything for this newly -born life!?
Why don’t you share some of that compassion with actual devils and the undead!? Ah, dammit, she’s here!
Sorry, Darkness, it was my fault! I took things too far yesterday! I’m sorry, so please forgive me!
Yeah, Darkness, let bygones be bygones. Anyway, I’ll make a delicious breakfast for you, so let’s head back in!
…So, what exactly did you do?
Hey, why are you looking at me? The number of problems I’ve caused should be countable on one hand!
What on earth did you do this time!? Hurry up and tell me!
Why does everyone immediately think I’m the culprit whenever something goes wrong?! I really don’t think it’s good to be so prejudiced towards others!
H-Hey, why do you want me to leave this place so badly?!
…Hey.
That’s not it!
Aqua, isn’t that a Tranquility Girl…
No, that is just a cute little mandrake that sprouted quickly! I did buy a mandrake seed this time!
You planted that here? In the first place, a mandrake isn’t any less dangerous than a Tranquility Girl! Move, Aqua! I’ll take care of it before it develops sentience! I won’t tolerate any discussion!
No, stop! I already gave a name to her! I thought she was a mandrake, so I named her Deadscream Bloody Mary-
Giving a mandrake a name like that means that you know exactly how dangerous they are, you idiot! To think I even sympathised with you! Darkness, hurry up and end it!
Good morning. You guys sure are lively this morning too. What happened this time?
Just where did you run off to, Megumin? I didn’t think you hated the idea of seducing that guy so much that you’d rather camp out in the wilds. I wouldn’t have forced you to go through with it, so don’t go to such dangerous places anymore, okay?
That’s not it. Just what kind of a barbarian do you think I am? It’s true that I left because I didn’t want to seduce that man, but there’s a proper reason for why I’m so covered in mud.
So what’s the reason? Did you find a monster worth a lot of experience points and chase after it? Or did you chase after the children after they made fun of your name?
Just what do you think I am!? There isn’t any child around here who would make fun of my name anymore. I made sure to teach all of them a lesson.
H-Hey, the parents around town have been coming to me to complain about your actions, you know? I have to apologize for you every time, so please keep that in mind and don’t do that sort of thing anymore, okay?
Well, I didn’t really have any place to go after running away from home last night. I thought I’d be able to meet some adventurers I know, so I wandered around town for a bit…
I came across Yunyun who was desperately trying to recruit others who would undertake that trial with her, so I lent her my aid once again.
Yeah, I think I know what happens next, so you can stop there.
Listen to me, Kazuma. I have the ability to learn, you know? Last time I undertook the trial, the first riddle was too troublesome, so I ended up blowing it up with magic. This time, in order to prevent myself from letting loose in a fit of rage, I entrusted my staff to Yunyun and was only there to be her follower.
Oh?
But, leaving Yunyun who failed the last trial aside, I’m now forbidden from being a partner after destroying the trial grounds the first time. So, after discussing it with Yunyun last night, we formulated a plan to sneak into the trial under cover of night.
After splitting up in the woods, we arrived at the newly constructed trial grounds without issue. This time, we properly tried to solve the riddle. After all, there’s the number one genius of the Crimson Demons and the one who claims to be that genius’s rival at the scene. Problems involving intelligence like riddles should be a cinch with the both of us.
I can’t help but get a bad feeling about this.
Come to think of it, I don’t think either of us have properly studied anything since graduating from school… The magic item refused to accept our answers no matter how many times we attempted it, so I got fed up and took my staff back from Yunyun… Perhaps because it was night when we attempted the trial, but the monsters started gathering after hearing the sound…
…I’ll ask just in case, but you didn’t get found out by the people in the village, did you?
Who do you think I am? As we were running away from the monsters, the people from the village started rushing over after hearing the sound of the explosion! Yunyun used Teleport to transport us to the village, so we managed to slip past them and made ourselves dinner while we waited for them to come back! But I underestimated the magical knowledge of the Crimson Demons. They somehow knew that I was the culprit by the next day, and asked me to compensate for the magic item…
Well, of course! Your Explosion is the most definitive evidence in the world! What magical knowledge?! You are the only Crimson Demon who can use Explosion!
Sorry, Kazuma. I’ll make sure not to leave any traces behind next time.
I feel like you’re taking away the wrong lesson from this whole incident. You shouldn’t be doing this in the first place!
So, what exactly happened with you guys?
W-What should we do?
What else is there to do? This is as much your fault as it is Aqua’s. You did make the field together with her.
Yeah, but I didn’t expect there to be monster seeds mixed in…
Kazuma, I’ll properly raise this girl. The reason why the other Tranquility Girls grew up to be bad apples is definitely because they were raised in a bad environment. If she is raised by a pure-hearted person who showers her with love, she’ll definitely grow up to be a good kid.
Enough. Aqua, Tranquility Girls are monsters. They are dangerous monsters that cause multiple deaths-.
Oh, yeah, we can raise it! Not bad, Aqua! You’re really smart today!
What, did you think of a great idea? I knew it, Kazuma-san always comes through at times like this! Hurry up and tell me!
Right, listen up, Aqua. First, we’ll raise this Tranquility Girl. Then, we’ll plant more of them. Tranquility Girls are monsters that convince travellers to rest by them before letting them wither away, right? That means that they have low offensive power. Still, they are worth a lot of experience points. So, if we have a field full of them, we’ll be able to easily level up-
I was a fool to even rely on you in the first place, you shitty NEET! Just which pit did you dump your humanity in? Even I’m taken aback!
Hey, wait, isn’t there a leveling method where strong Crimson Demons immobilize monsters so that weaker Crimson Demons can deal the finishing blow and level up that way? I was a little taken aback when I heard about it, but isn’t this the same thing? You were the guys constantly pestering me to raise my level!
The leveling method passed down through the Crimson Demons involves risking life and limb in order to immobilize strong monsters in the first place! Don’t compare it to this rule-breaking leveling up method!
Y-Yeah, this method may be effective, but this is just too inhumane…
Say, let’s leave this matter aside for the moment. More importantly is that man who dumped Darkness in a wonderful manner last night.
A-Aqua, can you please, don’t keep saying that I’ve been dumped…
Now that Darkness, the one in charge of all things lewd has failed, the next assassin is Lolimin. If he can withstand both of their attempts, I’ll have no choice but to acknowledge him.
I’ve said it multiple times, but I definitely will not do that! And don’t call me Lolimin! If you are willing to go that far, how about you stop standing on the sidelines and do it yourself!?
Yeah, that can work. If he can resist the charms of the beautiful and lovely Aqua-san, then his feelings must be quite determined indeed. Very well, Darkness might have failed, but I’ll have him dancing to my tune in no time!
Say, it’s a little thick-skinned of me to say this myself, but I don’t think I’m worse than Aqua as a woman. Hey, Aqua, you just snickered, didn’t you? Hold it right there, just how low do you place me in your mind!?
I still don’t believe that Aqua has the ability to seduce a man. In the first place, she’s the woman furthest away from any concept of romance.
Well, Aqua does look beautiful, so we can’t say for certain… But, yeah, her personality is a little…
Still, Aqua included, we’ve all been hit on when we visited other cities. We have a bit of an unfair reputation in this town, so no one dares to approach us, but normal people will fall right for us beautiful girls… W-what, Kazuma? Why do you look like you’re holding back laughter?
Hey, handsome-looking onii-chan drinking alone over there, you have the same air of loneliness as the shitty NEET at home. Can I have a moment of your time?
Oh, were you surprised by how beautiful onee-chan is? Fufu, how cute. The truth is, I have something very interesting to tell you. So, would you like to hear it?
…Oh, something interesting?… I see. Very well, I’ll play along. Barkeep, give this woman a cold one.
Oh, thanks. Usually the NEET I’m raising will treat me to a drink, but unfortunately he isn’t present today.
Y-You’re lying…You’re lying, right, Kazuma? That man rejected me without even looking twice. Why would he treat Aqua to a drink… D-Do I really have less sex appeal than Aqua? Aqua always acts like an airhead and doesn’t give off the appeal of a woman at all, but could it be that men like that kind of woman…?
C-Calm down, Darkness! He’s just treating her to a drink right now! Aqua gets treated to a drink pretty often, so this isn’t anything unusual!
So, what is this interesting thing you wanted to tell me?
Fufu, you’re a hasty one. Very well, I’ll tell you. I heard this from my neighbour Sutton-san. If you stick your finger into the butt of a stray neroid, it’ll let out a far loudernyaathan usual. You didn’t know this, did you?
… Is that some kind of code? Or is she speaking a different language?
Ka-Kazuma, what are they saying? He seems very interested in what Aqua has to say…
Hey, Kazuma, not only my sex appeal, but is my skill at wordplay also lacking compared to Aqua? It’s not like I was really comparing myself to her, but this is still a little shocking…
Then did you know about this? Even though the Pink-Shelled Mirumiru has the word ‘shell’ in its name, it’s actually a relative of the sea anemone. In an emergency, it will twist its body in an imitation of a conical shell, and drill its way through the water at high speed. Ah, but you probably don’t know what a drill is, right?
My apologies, but I have not heard that word before. In fact, I can only understand perhaps half of what you just told me, but you do not seem to be lying or attempting to trick me. I can’t detect a shred of wickedness from you. Whenever humans spout a lie, no matter how small a lie it is, they will definitely let out an aura of wickedness. From just that point alone, you appear to be exceptionally pure to me.
Oh, why would I ever tell a lie? Still, you have a pretty good eye. You’re a fantastic judge of people, especially when it comes to women.
I’m quite confident in grasping a man’s true nature.
Still, it’s such a waste. You have such a good eye, but you choose to fall in love with a corpse. I’ve heard that you are in love with an undead.
What!? Me, love an undead? How preposterous! There’s nothing I hate more in the world than undead and devils!
Hey, what happened, Kazuma? What are they talking about?
You suddenly turned really pale. Did that man say something?
Well, aren’t you a sensible man!? Yes, undead and devils are meant to be eradicated on sight! Especially devils! Just catching a whiff of their scent make my stomach churn!
Well said! Devils irritate me on a base level. Just why must such creatures exist in this world… That goddess Eris must be slacking in her job.
It can’t be helped. That Eris can’t do anything without the backing of her capable senior. Go ahead and relay this should the topic come up. Oh, and I’ll tell you some very useful information. Eris pads her chest. This is a very important piece of information that is written in the scriptures of the Axis Cult. Go ahead and spread it.
Eris pads her chests… Hahahaha, I’ve learned a very interesting piece of information! If I ever get the chance to see Goddess Eris again, I’ll be sure to tease her with this.
Hey, Kazuma, explain things! They sound like they are really chatting up a storm!
Aqua looks like she’s enjoying herself more than she ever had before. Are the two of them alright?
It’s been quite some time since I had so much fun talking about undead and devils! I would love to treat you, but sadly, I’ve run out of pocket money.
What are you saying? Of course I’ll be handling the tab! Now, drink up!
Kazuma! That man is ordering a whole bunch of drinks for Aqua! Doesn’t that mean I’m completely defeated?
Darkness, as Aqua said, we’re children. This is reality!
Then let’s drink till we drop!
That Duke guy is really fun to be around. I had a really great time last night.
A-A-Aqua has become an adult…
That’s not it, Megumin, Aqua has been an adult from the very beginning.
What are you saying now? I’m a respectable adult, you know? Of course we played some adult games together.
We played the game where we rolled dice in a bowl and determined the victor based on what came up. I lost every game, though. We also played a card game that I didn’t really get. I lost every game, though.
Oh, I didn’t have any money on me, so I paid off my debt with my body.
Are you serious!?
Well, it’s more like I used my head to pay it off. I told him interesting things in lieu of payment.
Y-You…
I told him various things like which types of shellfish are good to eat or what kind of flowers have sweet nectar, but that wasn’t enough. So, Kazuma-san, it was a necessary expense, so could you give me the money to pay it off?
Stop saying things that can be easily mistaken. You really gave me a shock just now.
… That’s the money to pay off your debts. Don’t say you’re going to win all your money back and gamble it all away.
… Kazuma, there’s a thing known as cycles when it comes to gambling. I’ve already lost a lot of games. That means that there’s no chance I’ll lose again. So leave it in my care.
Right, give it back to me. I’ll give it to Duke directly.
So, what do you think about that Duke fellow? He feels quite different from the earnest image I had of him a few days ago.
Hmm, well, I feel like he’s a mature man who understands the value of a good woman. He’s easy to handle for someone as experienced as me, but it might be a little too tough for a child like Wiz. But he hates devils and the undead, so he can’t be a bad person.
No, hold on, the fact that he hates undead is a major problem in itself. Is this really okay?
It’ll be fine. Wiz might be an undead, but she’s especially hygenic and doesn’t reek of rot, so it wouldn’t matter to him.
I don’t know why, but… Kazuma, after hearing Aqua give her glowing recommendation, I just end up feeling more suspicious about that man.
Still, all we did is investigate what kind of man he is. What comes next is up to Wiz. Plus, all he did was share a couple of drinks and get rowdy with Aqua. I often do the same thing with the female adventurers I know, so it doesn’t mean he’s an unfaithful or sloppy man.
That’s pretty unfaithful and sloppy from where I stand…
Duke gave me a message to pass on to Wiz when I told him I’m an acquaintance of her. Don’t worry, anyone who hates devils can’t be a bad person! Now, let’s head to the magic item shop!
Sacred Highness Exorcism!
Piyaaaa!
Stop purifying Zereschrute every time you come here! It’s not exactly easy to revive him!
Nevermind such matters right now! I have a message for Wiz, so call her out!
If you’re looking for Wiz, she’s out back talking to a flower. To be honest, it’s disgusting to even look at her. Moi really wishes she can hurry up and settle this matter so Moi wouldn’t have to deal with this anymore.
Say, Vanir, you saw through that Duke guy, right? Why did you praise him so much back then? I thought he was a pretty manly person, but he said something about hating devils and the undead. What’s up with that?
It’ll spoil the fun if Moi were to tell you right now, wouldn’t it? Fuhahahaha! Moi does not tell lies. It’s just as Moi said. When that lovestruck shopkeeper responds to that man’s wishes, a man will experience delight and merriment to a degree never before seen in this world. There’s no mistake in that. Devils do not tell lies, so just look forward to it!
By the way, why is that penguin manning the store? Did you hire him?
No, that storekeeper was useless in the first place, but she became even more useless after getting lovestruck. So, Moi thought to use Zereschrute with his cute-looking exterior to man the store, but… you can see how troublesome that ended up being.
Come to think of it, I haven’t gave you my name yet, right? … My name is Megumin! The number one mage in Axel and wielder of Explosion Magic! Please be careful not to get purified by Aqua and lose your insides again.
Oh, greetings, young lady of the Crimson Demons. My name is Zereschrute. You seem to be a frequent customer of this store, so please take care of me.
It’s Megumin. Don’t call me young lady, use my name. Or do you have something to say about this cool name of mine?
N-No, not at all, but… Names are very important to us devils, so we only address others by name if we highly respect them …
But didn’t you properly refer to our Darkness as Lady Dustiness?
T-That’s because I recognise Lady Dustiness as a respectable noble, that’s why…
I’m back…
Ara, welcome, Kazuma-san.
– I’ve been seriously thinking about it. Should I answer Duke-san’s feelings, or continue working hard at this store to make Vanir-san’s dreams a reality…
Moi has said it many times, if you get married, the store’s business will only pick up.
Aah, all I did was spend everyday peacefully managing this store, so how did it end up like this? Aqua-sama, what should I do? Vanir-san needs me, but…
What Moi needs is your magic, not your management expertise.
But Duke-san doesn’t just need me, he can’t live without me. He even said that he can’t imagine life without me…
No, wait, I’m pretty sure he didn’t go that far…
He even said that! What should I do, Aqua-sama? Which path should I choose…
Erm, that person seems like a pretty good guy, so it’s probably fine to go with him.
Is that so!? Aqua-sama thinks he’s a good man too!? Why would such a man be…
What’s wrong with Wiz? Did you feed her something strange?
Don’t say such heartless things. Moi has been concerned about her current state, so Moi has been giving her some proper food recently… But for some reason, this crazy shopkeeper got this strange idea that Moi has been treating her better in order to keep her in the shop.
I see. So you left her alone and she ended up like this.
There you have it. Right now, she spends all day with her head in the clouds. Though, she doesn’t buy any strange goods in this state, so she doesn’t get in the way of business… To us devils, psychological attacks are more effective than any kind of magic…
Shopkeeper in heat, that letter is asking you out to meet with him, right? Hurry up and go settle this, then return to the usual you and fulfill the contract you have with me!
… Does that mean, even though I am good for nothing but creating red digits, you still want me to continue being the shopkeeper?
You won’t listen even if I tell you to transfer the position over to me.
You really are a tsundere, Vanir-san.
How could a genderless devil be a tsundere? Stop saying disgusting things and go. Moi is the devil that sees through all, but after knowing you for so long, Moi doesn’t need to use my power to know what choice you’ll take. You might face a tough struggle, but don’t worry, you’ll definitely win. Moi is going out to receive some goods…
Once I’m done with that, I’ll be sure to rush to the scene. Moi has grown quite fond of you, so go have fun today, then, wipe out all the red numbers that you created. You fought with me on equal grounds back when you were still a human. There’s no way you can lose to a man of his caliber… Now, hurry up and go!
Roger!
Now, that’s enough talk! Ice Witch, let’s have a duel!
Why? Isn’t that obvious? It’s to demonstrate my power to you and have you give up your current job!
Y-You want me to marry you…
Leave your work to me! Then, let’s do this, you-!
Hey, Wiz, that Duke guy treated me to a drink yesterday.
Eeh?! W-What do you mean, Aqua-sama?! Didn’t everyone say that he’s a sincere and honest man?
Well, I thought to test if he really is a sincere person. He couldn’t resist the invitation of the beautiful me, and we ended up drinking till morning. But don’t worry, he didn’t do anything that could be mistaken for sexual harassment, and I couldn’t sense any of the wickedness that constantly hangs around Kazuma.
I-Is that so… But I’ve already decided on my answer, so you don’t have to worry, Aqua-sama.
When you respond to that man’s feelings, a man will experience delight and merriment to a degree never before seen in this world.
Oh? Well, it’s only natural for any man to fall for my charms, but he did push the erotic Darkness aside when she tried to seduce him. He can be said to be pretty sincere based off that.
I-Is that so…
Hey, Aqua! Stop using me as a standard for erotic matters!
What’s wrong? You seem to be deep in thought ever since you left the shop.
… No, it’s just, I have a really bad feeling for some reason… It’d be nice if it was just my imagination, but it feels like it wouldn’t be surprising if this ends in a bloodbath…
It’ll be fine. I don’t know how strong that Duke fellow is, but haven’t we defeated all the opponents we faced? Plus, we have the overwhelmingly powerful Lich, Wiz, with us today. And…
No matter what kind of enemy we face, I’ll blow them away with my Explosion. I’ll protect you, so don’t worry.
Y-Yeah…
No, it really isn’t.
Where did that come from?
Leaving Satou Kazuma aside, there are quite a few people I recognise. There’s the Lady of the Dustiness family… and isn’t that the soulmate with whom I talked about Shelled Mirumirus until sunrise with…
It’s not really my place to say, but are you really fine with that dress?
I’m sorry to say that I’m not very well educated in such matters, but this is my best outfit…
My apologies. I was sure that you were looking down on me.
O-Of course not! You’re the first person who made me dress up like this… Umm, I’m not too used to it, so, sorry…
I see. A skilled adventurer would usually be approached once or twice, but… It seems like you’re too famous. After hearing the name of the Ice Witch, most adventurers would be too afraid to even approach you, nevermind offer a challenge…
Y-yes! Yeah, that’s exactly it! Everyone was so afraid of me… Even though I wasn’t like that at all…
O-Oh, I see… I don’t really get it, but you have your own troubles as well, huh…
Then shall we get started? I’m sure there’s no need for us to exchange any more words. Or do you intend to run like last time?
I won’t run away. I intend to properly respond to your feelings today.
Oh?
I don’t wish to quit my current job. I have no intention of relinquishing my post. After all…
I made a promise with an irreplaceable, long time friend of mine.
The one known as the Ice Witch, and leader of the strongest adventuring party. Even after becoming undead, you still continue to pursue the path of magic. My name is Duke, the one who will eventually climb to the peaks of sorcery, just as you once did. King of Undead, Lich! I challenge you to a duel!
Inferno!
Freeze Gust!
Hey, Aqua, I’m really moved right now! Yes, this is what fantasy is! Vegetables flying around, catching mackerel in the fields, and monsters using erotic appeals to catch prey- those aren’t fantasy at all! This kind of actual magic is what isekai really is!
Hold on, Kazuma, you’re making it sound like Explosion isn’t real magic. Compared to such dull spells, isn’t Explosion much more amazing?
The kind of magical battle I want to see is not the kind where you just throw a single blow at the enemy regardless of its strength.There’s no elegance in Explosion. There’s no balance or strategy, it’s just a massive gamble that hinges on if you hit the enemy or not.
What-!?
Hmph. As expected of the Ice Witch. Crimson Laser!
Crystal Prison! Duke-san, please wait! Please, let’s talk things out!
What are you trying to do!? Why can’t you just behave yourself during such an important moment!?
You were the one who showed more interest in such amateurish spells than my Explosion, Kazuma! I feel a really strong ache in my heart when I see your eyes sparkle while looking at another mage’s spells! It didn’t hurt this much even when you were about to fall for Darkness’s seduction!
Just what is wrong with your sense of jealousy!? This is a duel between the two of them, so don’t interfere and just watch!
Why aren’t you seriously attacking me!? Are you looking down on me!? Lava Swamp!
Freeze! Fire Resist! Ouch!… I have no desire to defeat you nor do I have any desire to give up my current job! Liches have high magic resistance! I’ll withstand any attacks you dish out and make you give up!
Say, Kazuma, as a Crusader, would it be better if I were to stop their duel? Wiz doesn’t seem very keen on this duel, so should I…
Bind! Shut up and just stay there! You just want to experience what Advanced Magic feels like, don’t you!?
Kuh…! Using bind on me in such a situation, you really know how to tug at my heartstrings…
Wiz! You should hurry up and get serious! It’d be rude to Duke otherwise!
What are you saying, you idiot!? Stop messing around with Megumin and Darkness and hurry up and give Wiz some support!
Even if you say that, there’s no way I can seriously attack a man who is so passionate about me…
You really are looking down on me! Very well, perhaps I should make you treat this seriously! How’s this? Sanctuary!
Eeh? Ahhhhh!
Holy magic? Hey, Aqua, can Archwizards use Holy Magic?
Of course not! The only ones who can use Holy Magic are Priests, Archpriests, and Crusaders. But wasn’t he using Advanced Magic earlier? How could he use Holy Magic too?
Uugh! … Duke-san, please remember! Think back to the day we first met! You suddenly threw away your robe and approached me like you were trying to show me your naked body…
Don’t put it that way! There are other people watching, so I can’t remove it now, but there is a reason for that!
Duke-san… ‘There’s nothing in my mind except you. I’ve trained my body for so long just for you!’ you said this on our next meeting, didn’t you? And you also said ‘I know everything about you! You could say that I am the man who understands you best in this world’…! Even if it’s a little different from what I expected, but that’s still the first time anyone has said that to me…!
Just what are you saying!? Nevermind that, hurry up and get serious! Even if it’s you, you’ll still end up getting purified if this goes on!
To be honest, it made me a little happy to hear those words. But no matter what you say, I have no intention of giving up my current job. Plus, I still don’t know you too well. So…
Can we start by being friends?
Yeah! Well said, Wiz! Yeah, getting married so quickly would be too hasty, right!?
… Huh?
Well, this is probably the best outcome… You’re Duke, right? What happened the other day was, er, me seducing you as a test, so don’t think I’m an easy woman. But it’s great that you aren’t rejected outright.
…… Huh?
I think that Wiz is a determined person. But, Duke, was it? There seems to be some misunderstanding, but don’t worry, Wiz is no longer in charge of exorcism jobs from the real estate agent or purifying the ghosts in this cemetery, so you don’t need to worry about her.
……… Huh?
What are you guys saying? What’s that about friends and marriage and don’t worry and what not? I really don’t follow at all.
What are you saying? This is what Wiz is saying: ‘Giving up my work or suddenly marrying is impossible, but let’s start by being friends and see how things go from there.’ Isn’t that great? Yeah, you did get rejected, but there’s still hope.
W-What are you idiots saying!? Why must I be married to an undead Lich?! Where did that even come from?! And friends? What kind of joke is that!?
Eh!?
Hey, there’s no need to act like that just because you’ve been rejected! You were rushing things too much! It’s obviously too much to marry her right way! Just be happy that you can start as friends!
Like I said, why do all of you think I’m in love with this woman!? Is there something wrong with your brain!? This is only the third time I’ve met her, you know!?
You have the gall to say that after you stalked Wiz!? And weren’t you the one who proposed that she quit working at the magic item shop and come live with you!?
Huh?
… The job I want her to quit is her position as a General of the Demon King’s Army…
… Huh?
Like I said, the job I was referring to is her position as a Demon King’s General. It has nothing to do with the magic item shop…
Aah! T-That’s the Demon King’s…
Aah! Hold on, you were a fallen angel!? Here I thought you were a rare good person who hated devils and undead like me, but you’re just another fool who defied the word of the gods!
S-Shut up! And what about you!? I thought you were a great friend who shared my hatred of undead and devils, and even cheerfully spread bad rumours about Goddess Eris with me until the morning, but what’s with your clothes!? You were a priest!?
You really are an idiot. Who do you think I am? A mere fallen angel should hurry up and kneel before me! My name is Aqua! The one worshipped by 20 million Axis cultists all over the world! Yes, Goddess Aqua herself!
Great, so she’s just insane…
Hey, hold it right there!
So that’s why you could use Holy Magic! How could you do that!? You fell after going against the word of the gods, but you still dare to call upon their powers the moment you get into a pinch? Do you have no shame!?
S-Shut up! We angels get run ragged by the gods! It’s only fair that we get a little power as payment! If anything, I’m just collecting a little bit of late payment for my services! You probably don’t know this, but the goddesses are all…
FU HA HA HA HA HA! FU HA HA HA HA HA!
Welcome to this remote town, one who dreams of becoming a Demon King’s General. You were originally a servant of the hateful gods in the first place, but it seems like you just got more pathetic after falling!
Seems like I made it in time for the best part! Oh, to think that I almost missed such an amazing event!
… Vanir-dono, this is between me and Wiz. You may be a former General of the Demon King, but please do not interfere.
… So you deceived me?
What do you mean deceived? It has always been my intention to challenge you for the position of the Demon King’s General. I tried to remove my robe when we first met, didn’t I? That was so I could show you this crest and explain things to you.
… I-I thought it was a proposal… This was the first time someone confessed to me…
I-Is that so? That’s most unfortunate. Even so, this is still way too huge of a misunderstanding. This is but the third time we’ve met. There’s no way I would propose so soon.
I-I, I’ve been spending day and night seriously considering if I should really give up running the store… But I thought it’d be too pitiful for Vanir-san, so I came here to turn you down… Is it really that fun to toy with the heart of a Lich?! I won’t forgive you! This is the first time I’ve been so thoroughly humiliated! It was more humiliating than when I clashed with Vanir-san back when I was still a human! I even thought it was a proposal! I can’t believe you…!
Fuhaha~! Fuhaha~! Fuhahahaha~!
Vanir-san! Just what is so funny!? You didn’t foresee this, did you!? …Ah! ‘The devil that sees through all so declares! When you respond to that man’s feelings, a man will experience delight and merriment to a degree never before seen in this world.’ You weren’t referring to this when you said that, were you!? That man that will experience delight and merriment, that was referring to yourself after you’ve tasted my dark emotions!
Fuhaha~! Fuhahahaha~! This is superb! These are dark emotions of the highest grade that Moi has not tasted in some time! They’re delicious! They are delicious indeed! Fuhaha~!
Vanir-san!
W-Well, I apologize for that! But I have my complaints too! If you didn’t live in this town, I wouldn’t have to hide my crest, and this misunderstanding wouldn’t happen in the first place. Yes, it’s because you ignored your duties as a general to live in this town. I just couldn’t leave things in the hands of such a klutz!
I’m not a Demon King’s General because I want to be! I’m only doing this because there’s no one else that’s magically skilled enough to maintain the barrier and the Demon King begged me to do it! How could you call me a klutz…!
You are a klutz! The number of generals have reduced to the point where even the barrier itself is at risk! Furthermore, our fortresses at the frontlines have fallen, and even that scheme that has been in the works for a long time in the shadows has fallen through.
After some investigation, I found that all of those incidents have something to do with that weak-looking man over there. I let my guard down thinking that he’s a weakling that would lose to a kobold, and this is how things ended up… Yes, you, Satou Kazuma!
‘I’m willing to support you.’ You said this when we met in the bar, didn’t you? You said that to make me let my guard down, and now you’ve even brought Vanir-dono over to surround me. Kukuku, you’re a pretty good schemer, aren’t you?
I’ve already sent a report about this to Demon King-sama. This town will eventually become a priority target for the Demon King’s army.
Are you serious!?
Eeh?
This town will become a priority target?… Are you going to attack this town?
H-Hey, Kazuma, isn’t this getting a little dangerous? I really don’t think I have the luxury to enjoy this kind of play right now, so can you please undo this Bind?
S-So you finally got serious. Still, as expected of a Lich. To be able to cast such a powerful spell without chanting… Your age really isn’t just for sho-
Kazuma, things are getting a little suspicious. Being tightly held down like this by someone I like isn’t too bad, but I’m not Darkness, so can you please let go of me? I want to make preparations so I can cast my magic at any time.
If I let you free, you’ll just ignore the mood and steal her kill, right? Don’t worry, now that Wiz has snapped, we can leave it to her. Just watch.
Brat, it’s best that you don’t take your eyes off this. The devil that sees through all so declares, thou shalt see a most amazing sight.
Uugh! I-Infer-
Cursed Crystal Prison!
Do you surrender?
Way to go, Wiz! This really is a fitting revenge for dumping you!
Wait, Aqua-sama, I didn’t do this for revenge!
Hey, Vanir, why didn’t you tell us that Wiz had a misunderstanding? We would be able to finish this with a battle without having to go through such an ordeal if you told us.
Yeah! Hey, Vanir! I had to seduce that man because of you, you bastard!
What does Moi care about that? In order to taste the most exquisite dark emotions, Moi is willing to do anything. Yes, this harem brat who’s getting full of himself because the two of you are fighting over him. If, for instance, the two of you get disgusted and dump him, Moi will be able to experience some delicious dark emotions indeed.
C-Cut it out. No, seriously, please stop… I’ll go take some useless goods off your hands in the near future…
By the way… Things aren’t over just yet.
… Huh?
W-What is he doing!?
He actually did it! Look, brat! That man pretended to surrender, only to use that chance to perform one of the taboos of sorcery– yes, that’s the ritual to become a Lich! Fuhaha~! He willingly turned himself into an undead that he was bashing just a short while ago in order to attain power! Fuhaha~! This is way too amusing!
You let your guard down, Wiz! Gurk… Behold this overflowing mana of mine… Ah, power is just overflowing from the wound I made with my dagger! I can feel the cells in my body slowly dying off and turning into an undead existence! I might have fallen, but I was still originally an angel. I didn’t want to do this if I could avoid it, but I have no choice… Now, let’s have an eternal battle as fellow immortals-
Sacred Highness Exorcism!
GRAAAAAAH!
W-W-W-What is this…! I should have become the strongest undead, a Lich! What on earth…!
You ended up like this because you got involved with me… At the very least, I’ll grant you a painless death… Drain Touch…
Wait-Stop! No, don’t! Wait! This is a misunderstanding! It’s all a big misunderstanding!
Misunderstanding? After turning into a Lich, what’s there to misunderstand?
That’s the misunderstanding! T-The reason I became a Lich is… Yes, it’s not because I wanted to take revenge on you, but so I can be together with you for eternity as a fellow unaging undead!
T-That’s… Y-You can’t fool me! Such flowery words won’t…
I-I’m not deceiving you! I fell in love with you during our battle! Of course, I won’t suddenly propose that we get married off the bat, but… just as you said earlier, I would like to request that we start by being friends!
S-Start by being friends…
Kind and gullible shopkeeper, allow Moi to tell you something. Fallen angels and the angelic race are similar to devils in that they have no gender.
W-Wait-!
EXPLOSION!!
Waaah! This is too much! It’s way too much! Waah!
Come on, I’ll share some of the vegetables I harvested, so cheer up, Wiz. It’ll be fine, you’re a decent girl, so I’m sure you’ll meet a good man soon.
*sob*, *sob* Aqua-sama… Will that really happen? Time won’t just keep slipping by…
It’s fine even if you wait. After all, aren’t you immortal? That means there’s no need for you to lower your standards just because you are getting old. That’s a very big benefit, you know?
Y-Yeah, I don’t age. I don’t need to get desperate or lower my standards.
Even if you don’t get old, your age on the family registry will still go up.
Hey, strange devil, stop saying unnecessary things! See! Wiz has started crying again!
Hey, how long do you intend to cry for, you heartbroken shopkeeper!? Stop moping around and open the store for business! Didn’t you want to help Moi achieve my wish? At this rate, how many centuries will it take for me to be able to create my dungeon? Moi might be immortal, but it’d be pointless if humanity goes extinct before the dungeon is complete.
You don’t need to tell me that… As a Lich, no matter who I get together with, in the end, all I can do is watch them slowly age and be left alone… Even after humanity goes extinct, I’m sure I’ll be all alone…
Seriously… You aren’t the only immortal, you know? We devils are immortal too. Until the day my dungeon is complete and adventurers come to vanquish me, Moi will stay with you, so cheer up, my friend.
… In other words, if the dungeon forever remains incomplete, Vanir-san will be with me forever?
Right, I’ll set my sights on taking away your management rights. You couldn’t be satisfied with facing such a half-baked opponent, right? Very well, it’s been some time, but I’ll be your opponent!
Ah, wait, Vanir-san! I was just joking! I’m sorry, I apologize! I’ll work hard! I’ll work hard, so please forgive me!
-Well, all’s well that ends well, so that’s a relief.
Are you seriously saying it ended well after seeing that?
… Marriage, huh. Darkness, you’re the sole heir to your family, so isn’t it about time you start seriously considering it?
M-My father is quite understanding, so you could say I’ve been afforded more freedom in such matters compared to the other nobility… Though, I suppose I am at the age where I should start considering such issues. Still, if we talk about age, the most perilous one is Aqua.
Hey, Kazuma, let me tell you something interesting. You see, Darkness keeps a diary of her daily experiences with us in her room. But that’s not the interesting point, the interesting bit is that there’s a strange mechanism underneath where she keeps that book, and in it is where she writes all of her fantasies-
Aqua, get over here! When did you get in? I’m sure I locked my room properly! How much do you know?
Kazuma, how many children do you want in the future?
Pfft!
Hey, if it isn’t Yunyun. Did you come over to play and wait for us because we were out? What should we play today? I’m very excited after seeing someone else’s Explosion today, so why don’t we head over to the lake and see who can catch the most fish…
Umm, well… I have a request for Kazuma-san…
What do you want with Kazuma? Why is everyone always coming to this man for help whenever they have a problem? Don’t they have any shame?
I already failed the trial twice because of you, so I can’t fail again!!!
…? Hey, what’s all this fuss about?
Oh, isn’t that Kazuma? It’s magic items. A magic item peddler has arrived.
Magic item.
There’s got to be some kind of downside, right? Like it’ll explode upon use or it’ll affect all targets indiscriminately or something.
These aren’t the items that Wiz-san sells, so you don’t have to worry about that. You’re loaded, so why don’t you take a look? Your companions are already out there picking stuff out.
Oh, Kazuma, you came to the right place. Look at this item! It’s a potion that can increase my magic power for a short time! There are no downsides! I would like to borrow some money!
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, this is a cleaning tool that will spin around once supplied with mana. I would really like you to buy it. It’d be much easier to clean the toilets with this. Oh, and it seems like there are no downsides.
A bandana that can increase dexterity, huh… Should I buy it? No, wait, in that case, my attacks will hit. But, on the other hand, we’ve been going up against a lot of strong enemies recently…
Right, buy it. Buy it right now. Actually, I’ll pay for it, so put it on right now.
Wha-Kazuma! No, wait, this has, you know, downsides…
Ah!
That’s unfair, Kazuma! Please buy my item too! Or at least lend me some money!
I don’t want to return this, so please buy it for me! This magic item will definitely be fun! If I put some water on it and make it spin, it’ll definitely spray water everywhere. If I use it well, it can be used as part of a party trick to create rainbows!
Shut up! You don’t need that stuff! Even if I bought that potion for you, Megumin, you’ll just drink it immediately without waiting for a boss to appear! And that thing isn’t a toy, Aqua!
What’s this? Paralyze stone?
Oh, you have a good eye, dear customer. That’s an exceptional item that has a certain chance of paralyzing a target it hits. That said, there is a downside…
In addition to the chance of paralyzation being low, it’s quite rare, so there’s only one for sale. On top of that, it’s pretty expensive, and it’s not a suitable item to trust your life to in the heat of battle… After all, if the paralyzation fails to work, the enemy can pick it up, and it’d now be a threat to you. It’s an item that anyone can use, so now you’d be the one at risk of being paralyzed.
Old man, I’ll buy this stone.
Huh? Are you sure, dear customer? I mean, as a storeowner, it’d be a great help if you’d take it off my hands, but…
Hey, Megumin, you want to try taking on my new technique?
Oh? Well, as long as it wouldn’t harm me, I don’t mind.
Steal!
Ouch!
Hey.
That’s not it, hear me out.
My new technique is meant to allow me to retrieve the paralyze stone after it hits an opponent. It’s a technique that allows me to throw an infinite number of paralyze stones. My Steal has a weird trait of targeting more expensive items. In other words, it’s your fault for wearing expensive panties!
I don’t wear expensive panties! Actually, I can’t move!
Y-You came up with an amazing technique of paralyzing someone and stealing their panties…
You devil… No, comparing you to them is an insult to devils…
Say, Kazuma… How much do I have to pay to experience that new technique of yours?
I won’t use it on you no matter how much you pay! Old man, I want a refund! Hey, Aqua, don’t pretend like you don’t know me, help me persuade him for a refund!
You’re here, Megumin. Did you have any problems? You weren’t seen by the others, were you?
Don’t worry, I confirmed that no one was following me before coming here, and I also asked what everyone back at home was planning on doing today. Kazuma said that he didn’t want to be woken up before evening, Aqua was heading out to the river to gather interesting looking pebbles, and even the recently free Darkness has gone out to oversee the engineering crew in filling in the nearby craters that the Explosion Devil created last night.
Make sure you properly apologize to Darkness-san after this, okay?
Forget after this, ever since last night, I’ve been lectured by her all the way until this morning. I vehemently denied it and demanded that she show me proof, but it seems like that just made things worse.
I don’t know why you would deny it to such a degree, but nevermind. Let’s just hurry up and get it done while nobody’s here.
This color and fragrance… I can’t believe you managed to get your hands on this…
This is a pretty top grade item if I say so myself. Heheh, this will definitely become the best ritual ever!
Hehehehehe… Right, now, all that’s left is the secret technique passed down amongst the Crimson Demons…
What secret technique?
AHHHHH!
K-K-K-Kazuma, don’t scare me like that! No, wait, that’s not it, what are you doing here!?
This is bad, Megumin! Someone else saw the contents of the pot!
Damn… Now that you’ve seen it, we have no choice. You should gather your resolve, Yunyun.
H-How did this…
Hey, hold on a minute, you two aren’t thinking about doing something dangerous, are you!? If it’s some kind of top secret ritual passed down through the Crimson Demons, I can pretend I didn’t see it, so let’s calm down and talk things through!
… Right, why don’t you lend us a hand, Kazuma? We’ll give you a portion of the secret Crimson Demon rabbit hot pot if you do.
Yeah, it’s a secret, but it can’t be helped if you saw it. Kazuma-san, can you help us stir the pot?
Wait, rabbit hot pot? You snuck out here and did all those cloak and dagger stuff just to make a hot pot? Weren’t you doing something like calling down an evil god or something?
What are you talking about, Kazuma? We don’t need stuff like evil gods and the like. We’re planning on going moonwatching after this. This is the best day of the year for that.
Should you really be doing such things in autumn? It’s freezing.
Kazuma-san, the colder it is, the clearer the air will be, and thus the moon will appear to be more beautiful.
I’m surprised. To think that the Crimson Demons that are the furthest away from any sense of aesthetics and elegance would have a tradition of moonwatching…
Hey, hold on a minute, just what do you think Crimson Demons are, Kazuma?
There are artists amongst the Crimson Demons too! And we also do stuff like picnics and hikes, you know!?
Anyway, why rabbit hot pot?
We aren’t really sure about that either. It seems like a famous Crimson Demon once said that talking about the moon brings rabbits to mind, or something along those lines.
Well, I think we can start moonwatching now. Are the two of you ready?
Yeah. I’ve put in a lot of practice in preparation for this day.
It’s really cold, so I would like to hurry up and finish my hot pot and head home… And what do you mean by practice?
Right, we’re starting. Yunyun, make sure you go along with me.
What are you two doing!? I don’t get it at all! Are you two trying to become one with nature!? Do the Crimson Demons have werewolf blood in them as well?!
Moonwatching obviously involves howling. Come on, Kazuma, join us!
It might be embarrassing at first, but it’s really fun once you get used to it. It’s just like working together with companions…
Look, Kazuma, isn’t the moon beautiful…
Yeah, that’s a very famous line in my country, but with Yunyun howling at my side, I can’t feel a single shred of romance in this situation at all!
Why did you do such a thing, Vanir-san!? How do we remove this!? (Moi didn’t think that you’d have such a strange resistance to this! This is the first time Moi has possessed a Lich, so this is completely unexpected! Now that it’s come to this, why don’t you just leave your body and spirit in my care and let me manage this store?) I don’t want that! Who knows what will happen to my body if I were to let you do as you wish!
Hey, what kind of game are you two playing? Is it fun?
Ah, Aqua-sama! Actually (If it isn’t the troublesome goddess that only appears at times like this! As you can see, we are very busy right now, so go back home!)
Y-You… I know you’ve been giving me a bit more tea and snacks lately, but don’t think just that will be enough to excuse such a tone!
C-C-Calm down, Aqua-sama! Look carefully, that just now was (There’s no way a Lich like me would want to curry favour with goddesses in the first place! The tea that I served you in the past were all expired goods. Didn’t you notice-) I really will get angry, Vanir-san!
Say, Wiz, at the end of the day, aren’t you a Lich? How could you let your body be taken over by a devil so easily? And you, weird devil, do you really like Wiz that much? Do you really want to stick to Wiz that much?
Even if you say that (If it were up to Moi, if moi had to possess a body, moi would obviously choose a better, easier to control vessel!) In short, Vanir-san… Hey, hold on a minute, Vanir-san! How could you say that after suddenly possessing me!
I see. I don’t get it at all. Can you two explain things one at a time… Seriously, just what happened here?
That would be… Vanir-san said that he wants to sell a new product, but, well, he calls it a product, but… (A shop where the owner provides a service of lap pillows and ear cleanings. Doesn’t this shopkeeper look like she’s overflowing with kindness and curves? So I conducted a survey amongst the adventurers that went, ‘If such a shop existed, would you frequent it?’. More than 50% of them said that they would become regular customers, 30% of them said, ‘hurry up and open the store!’, and 20% of them wished that the lap pillow be available for afternoon naps as well. It was very well received.)
Of course I’ll become a regular customer too! When are you opening? Will you be offering afternoon naps and bed warmer services too?
Don’t joke with me too, Kazuma-san! In the first place, my lap and such is too cold, so it wouldn’t be very comfortable, and it’s too shameless! I can’t do that…! Plus, all the adventurers who responded to the survey were just joking with me!
I see, so you wanted to force Wiz to do that… But Wiz is kind and soft, so I think that it wouldn’t be a bad experience. Why don’t you let me try!?
Let Aqua-sama try… Well, I don’t have a problem with that… But I’ve never cleaned another person’s ear before, so…
…Come on, you’re doing pretty well for your first time. I think I might nod off like this… Hey, Wiz, it’s starting to hurt a little. You don’t have to dig that deep, do you? Hey, did you hear me? It hurts!
What are you doing, Vanir-san? I won’t let you have your way! (Hey, Wiz, stop getting in my way! This is the perfect opportunity! Moi won’t give up like this!)
Well… I understand how you were possessed, but how did you two become inseparable?
(Hmm, well, Liches are fundamentally cursed existences. After possessing such a thing, Moi ended up getting cursed too.) Don’t make it sound like I’m a cursed item!
Well, I am fairly interested in the lap pillow ear cleaning business, so why don’t we just keep things as it is?
No! If I’m sharing the same body as Vanir-san, I wouldn’t be able to even take a bath! (There’s no need to worry about that, Moi has no interest in your naked body at all, so you can rest assured and attend to your business.) You’re tactless! Vanir-san is way too tactless! Can’t you borrow Aqua-sama’s power and think of some way to seperate us!?
If I use purification magic until only one of you is left, would that count as separating you two?
Please think of some other method! Kazuma-san is especially reliable at times like this, so do you have any good ideas!?
When a ring gets stuck on your finger, you can easily slip it off after coating it with soap and the like.
I’m begging you, Kazuma-san, please think more seriously about this! (Why don’t you just give up and open the lap pillow service? We’ll be able to earn some more money and eat something more filling than what you have now.) No! Plus it’d be very troublesome if things were to continue like this. Speaking of which, ever since this started, well… (Ah, Moi see. Don’t worry, young lady, Moi will try my best to not hear anything, so…) AAAAAAAAHHHH!
Hey, are you guys done with your preparations!? You properly maintained your equipment, right!?
Aah, my armour is really glittering after all that polish! My beloved greatsword too has been sharpened to a fine edge, so expect great things from me!
Say, Darkness, maybe you should give up on fighting with a sword and just use your fists instead.
Well, then, if you’re going to say that, maybe I shall start making use of my fists right now. Come over here, Aqua.
… Why’s everyone so motivated? In the first place, there are stores in the Crimson Demon village, so I don’t think there’s any need to bring so much stuff with us…
What are you saying!? It’s a trial, you know!? A trial! One that can challenge even the tribe of elite mages, the Crimson Demons! No matter how much preparations we make, it will never be enough!
Can you please stop blaming others for you failing the trial!?
Then just whose fault could it be!? I told you not to use Explosion, so why!? Why must you fire it off at the worst possible place!?
Now, now, calm down, Yunyun. It’s unreasonable to expect a girl like her who lives like an exploding firework not to use Explosion magic. I mean, it’d be like expecting Axis Cultists to act mature and reserved. It’s just not possible.
W-When you put it that way, it feels like I’m the one who was in the wrong…
Kazuma, that example is being rude to Axis Cultists. My children are a little free-spirited, but they aren’t as bad as Megumin.
Right, come at me, all three of you! I’ll show you what happens when a Crimson Demon gets serious!
A single person can only undertake the trial three times, so after failing it twice, this is your last chance, right? I’ve actually heard about this trial before. The Dustiness house has dealt extensively with the Crimson Demon Village. The beloved armour that my house uses is a high-quality product made by the Crimson Demons.
The Crimson Demon’s Trial is designed to be undertaken by a team consisting of a strong vanguard and a Crimson Demon as a rearguard, or so I’ve heard… This must be some kind of fate. Megumin is already like family to me, so I’ll take care of her messes. Leave the vanguard position to me!
R-Really!? I’ll be able to rest easy if someone capable of using Decoy like you is my vanguard! P-Please lend me your strength!
Darkness, you’re just looking forward to having a chance to shine after all this time, aren’t you? I mean, all you did back during Wiz’s incident was seduce that guy.
Bluh!
Say, would it be really problematic for you if you didn’t become chief? Like, your family has been the chief for generations, so if you fail this trial, they’ll disown you or something…? Becoming the chief means being the best amongst the Crimson Demons, so I guess competition would be pretty fierce…
No, if I have to say, most of the Crimson Demons are pretty ambivalent about the position of chief. The position ties them down and comes with a lot of responsibilities, so…
I don’t have any traits or skills that stand out or any other special ambitions, so it’ll a problem when I introduce myself as a Crimson Demon…
Let’s just give up on being the chief. We’ll help you think of a new way to introduce yourself.
As expected of Kazuma! We’ll have this solved in five minutes!
Please wait, you’ve got it wrong! That’s not all there is to it! The Crimson Demons are pretty free-spirited, so who knows what will happen if there isn’t a chief… but, as I just said, there isn’t anyone else other than me who wants to be chief badly enough to undertake the troublesome trial…
I guess there’s no choice. In that case, I shall become the chief-
You can’t even use advanced magic! Plus, becoming the chief means you have to go back to the village, you know!? If you’re only saying this because you think the title of chief sounds really cool, I’ll get angry!
Now now, calm down you two. At the end of the day, Yunyun just needs a strong partner, right? In that case, leave it to me. I’ll show you why everyone runs to me whenever there’s a crisis!
W-What’s wrong? Normally, Kazuma would think of this as a chore, so why are you so agreeable today?
Oh, I know, it’s because there are a lot of beautiful girls in the Crimson Demon Village!
Oh, does the slutty lady with extensive knowledge of seduction techniques think I’m some kind of raging beast or something? I think I’ve been looked down upon lately. Maybe I’ll take this chance to remind you of what I can do.
Oh, I get it now! Kazuma’s name just appeared in the newspaper a few days ago, so you intend to hole up in the Crimson Demon Village until the heat dies down, right? That Duke fellow came here to challenge Wiz after all, so I’m sure he’s worried that he might be the target of some adventurers too!
T-That’s not it! Unlike the three of you who do nothing but cause trouble for me every day, Yunyun is an important friend of mine who has common sense. Of course I’d help her if she’s in trouble!
Wait, I think the amount of trouble we create has really gone down recently… Why are you blushing, Yunyun!? This man is just saying some superficial compliments like he usually does! You’re being way too easy right now!
Hey, Kazuma, do you seriously intend on becoming Yunyun’s partner? The Crimson Demon Village is surrounded by nothing but strong monsters, you know? I can serve as a meatshield even if I can’t land my attacks, but you…
Yeah, the weak Kazuma-san would be eaten up by the monsters over there. Why don’t you stay and watch the house together with me? Let Darkness have her turn in the spotlight for once. She hasn’t really stood out much recently. There might be more follow-up interviews from the newspapers, so I kinda feel sorry to have her most recent achievement be seducing… Ouch! Hey, Darkness, I was supporting you, so why did you hit me- Ah, stop! Stop!!
Is Satou Kazuma-san here?
Um, a high level adventurer who travelled here from the Capital is requesting a meeting with Satou-san. If you have the time, could you join us at the guild?
Sorry, I’m heading over to the Crimson Demon Village right now to help an important friend of mine. I probably won’t be back for a while, so please have them come again another day.
Ka-Kazuma-san…!
So, tell this to that adventurer… ‘Satou Kazuma has left on gruelling journey for the sake of a friend. He might not make it back alive, so forget about him and go on ahead to fight the Demon King…’
S-Satou-san…
I got it! I’ll be sure to relay that to the beautiful adventurer who claimed to be a fan of Satou-san!
Eh?
Is Yunyun not here yet!? I’m all done with my preparations here! We’ll blow through the Crimson Demon’s Trial in a single day!
I can’t wait, Kazuma. Protecting the backline is the job of a knight, so leave the trial to me!
I refuse. After all, there’s a beautiful female adventurer waiting for my return. How can I not take this chance to show off?
D-Don’t get in my way for such a foolish reason! Come on, Kazuma, give me a chance at the spotlight too! This isn’t like you at all. Why didn’t you go meet up with that fan of yours yesterday?
If I were to meet up with a fan on the very same day they asked, that’ll make me seem desperate and lame, wouldn’t it? It’d be best to resolve Yunyun’s issues first, then walk back into the guild saying something like ‘Well, well, this incident wasn’t that big of a deal after all…’ in a loud voice. Afterwards, I’d naturally run into the fan and everything will progress naturally.
W-What’s with that elaborate act? Your everyday behaviour couldn’t be any more slobbish, yet you care so much about this…
I need to bring back some tales for my fan, so I’m going to get a lot of accomplishments this time. You can just stay here and watch over the house.
N-Not a chance! The Crimson Demon’s Trial is modelled after a famous legend and requires a vanguard and rearguard working together to overcome many challenges. My admiration for that legend is what set me on the path to become an adventurer! Come on, Kazuma, chances like these rarely come by, so please grant me this!
What really set you on the path to become an adventurer is something far more perverted! Don’t think you can get away with lying now! I want to play at being a hero too!
T-That isn’t a lie! I won’t deny that I had my eyes set on something less upright when I became an adventurer, but I really did start admiring adventurers as a child because of those legends! And you said you wanted to play at being a hero, right!? Don’t get in my way with such a cheap motive!
Do you two really want to play hero and mage so badly? I’ll play with you however long you want when you get back from the Crimson Demon Village, so behave yourself for now.
Protecting Megumin doesn’t quite, how do I put it, it doesn’t have the same feeling…
Y-Yeah, rather than recreating a legend, it feels more like heading out on a pleasant trip…
Fine, then instead of playing the role of the princess, I’ll play the role of the last boss! I’ll be the evil magician that appears at the end of the first book! Now, bring it on!
We’ll be going on a journey for a while, so maybe we should get someone to water the fields? Wiz is already taking care of Chomusuke and Zell, so maybe we should get her to water the fields too…
Oh, yeah, I completely forgot about it with everything that’s happened, but that thing was planted on our field! Hey, Darkness, Megumin, restrain Aqua for a while, I’ll take care of this thing before we head off!
Wait, what are you saying!? I won’t let you do that, you cold-blooded NEET! It’s fine, if I water her with divine water provided by a goddess, she’ll definitely grow up to be a good girl!
No way! We don’t need another pet at our house! We already have our hands full taking care of Chomusuke and Zell and Aqua, we can’t have yet another one!
Please, I’m begging you! I’ll properly water her every day and take her for walks… Wait, did you just say my name as well?
H-Hey, Darkness, isn’t ensuring the safety of the town the duty of the nobles? You wanted your turn at the spotlight, so I’ll let you take this.
N-No, you have the lowest level out of all of us despite being our leader of sorts, so you should have this.
Don’t get attached to her just because you’ve been watering it with Aqua for a few days! Hey come on, Lady Dustiness, protect this town from monsters!
You sure love to shoot your mouth off. Fine, since you’re involved with this as well, here’s an order from your Lord. Take care of this Tranquility Girl… T-Tranquility Girl…
… How about replanting it somewhere deep in the Crimson Demon Forest where people don’t go…
Now all that’s left is to wait for Yunyun to show up. Knowing her, I expected that she’d show up a few hours early or something, but…
No, she’ll show up right at the appointed time. There was a time back in the Crimson Demon Village where she was invited by her friends to play, and ended being so excited for it that she showed up half a day early. She was later advised that coming off this strongly will scare off her friends.
Yeah it’s the exact time we agreed to meet, but appearing just in time isn’t charming either!
E-Eh? Why are you angry at me even though I’ve just arrived!?
Good morning, everyone. Please treat me… Eh, u-um, the thing Aqua-san is holding is…
This girl is the one who will eventually become the chief of the Crimson Demon Forest, Deadscream Bloody Mary. She’s moving to a place close to your hometown, so please treat her well.
That’s a Tranquility Girl, right? That name sounds like an alias, so I would like to give it a different one if possible… Come to think of it, the villagers often tell me never to get close to a Tranquility Girl for some reason…
Tranquility Girls are like the natural enemies of loners. Don’t let your guard down just because it’s small, okay?
Now then, everyone, let’s be on our way. Teleport-
E-Eh? Yunyun? Megumin!?
Oh crap! Megumin and Yunyun brought in outsiders! Everyone, hurry up and change!
Wait a minute! I had to throw my Crimson Demon robe out because it got eaten by bugs! I need to buy one right away!
Hey, lend me that broom! I need a staff!
Cloak! Where’s my black cloak!? Ahh, Mom, where did you put my cloak!?
Hey, you two, you should tell us in advance if you’re going to bring someone from outside the village with you!
Yeah, yeah! Everyone’s in a panic thanks to you! It’s fine if you’re walking here, but you gotta give us some advance notice if you’re arriving by teleport!
Oh, if it isn’t my classmates Sakiberi and Nerimaki. It’s been some time.
It’s Funifura and Dodonko! Nerimaki isn’t even here! We properly named ourselves back in Axel recently, didn’t we!?
Yo, it’s been some time. Say, if you don’t mind me asking, why is everyone in the village in such a panic?
Visitors would be really disappointed if they were to visit a village of mages only to find everyone clad in normal clothes, right? Normally, the patrolling NEETs would come and inform us of any approaching visitors, but…
Yeah, it’s really troubling when you suddenly teleport in like this.
You don’t have to change for visiting tourists like us, put that effort towards fighting the Demon King’s Army instead.
Look, Kazuma! A mage is stirring a mysterious cauldron!
Outsider young lady, it’s best to keep your distance… What I’m making right now is the forbidden…
It’s curry! She’s making curry, Kazuma! I can smell it from here!
Kazuma, that girl is drawing some kind of magic circle. It seems like she’s preparing for some kind of ritual…
You over there, it’s dangerous to get too close! I’m about to start a forbidden ritual to break the seal of a powerful devil that’s been sealed here since ancient times… Magic has already started leaking from this magic circle. Don’t worry about me and just go. This is but a regular occurrence for us Crimson Demons. Vanquishing a simple ancient devil would be a piece of cake-
Leave devils to me! With the high level Archpriest Aqua-san here, I’ll blast him away the moment he appears!
… This is strange, I can’t sense any sinister magic in the air at all. There isn’t any of that stench that comes with devils either, so maybe he isn’t coming out anytime soon? Ah, but it’s fine, I’m really free right now! If it’s to vanquish a devil, I’ll wait here for an entire day!
Say, Megumin, doesn’t that lady seem a little troubled?
Oh, is that Soketto? I was wondering what she was doing… That magic circle is just an attraction for tourists. All it does is glow and sparkle. It’s probably the first time Soketto has seen someone react like Aqua, so I’m sure she is quite troubled.
… Damn, this devil started fiercely resisting all of a sudden. It seems like he’s scared by your presence. Unfortunately, I don’t have enough mana to break through the seal… But, well, this is fine too. Thank you. The village is saved thanks to you…
Don’t worry, leave it to me! Hey, Kazuma, transfer my mana to this lady! If it’s for dragging a devil out here, I’ll give you as much of my divine mana as you need!
Right, leave it to me! If it’s to vanquish a devil, I’ll happily lend a hand!
As expected of Kazuma, you catch on fast! Don’t worry, my mana is inexhaustible, so you can take as much as you want!
Soketto-san is about to cry, so please stop!
… Seriously. That cool and strong-willed Soketto ended up almost being driven to tears. She’s the Crimson Demon’s best fortune teller. If you tease her too much, she’ll start spreading stuff about you that you don’t want revealed.
Sorry, she looked really pretty, so I just… Anyway, what do you mean by that? After all this time, there’s nothing I particularly need to hide, so threats like that won’t work.
Back when a NEET named Bukkoroli made her angry, she revealed stuff like when he usually takes a bath or uses the toilet, his past embarrassing incidents and fetishes, and even what he gets up to at night, and caused him to coop himself in his room for quite some time.
I’ll definitely apologize when I see her again.
S-Say, Megumin, what is that person doing? He seems to be directing that golem to attack a rotating pot, is that some kind of ritual or something?
That person is the best potter amongst the Crimson Demons. He’s rotating that pot using clay magic and shaping it with that golem. He doesn’t use his hands because they’ll get dirty, so he uses the golem instead.
Hey, hey, what are those people over there doing?
Tornado!
Create Water!
They’re just doing laundry.
You people are really great at using magic for frivolous purposes.
…Well, this should be the right spot, but…
Who’s there?
Fufu, who do you think it is?
Our house might look impressive, but we have no money. Please go away.
It’s me! Your older sister Megumin! You can tell from my voice, right!? Please open up!
… I don’t have an older sister. She died in an explosion.
What are you saying!? I’m well alive and here in front of you! Come on!
My nee-chan would show her face at home after coming back so many times..
Ah! N-No, umm, that’s… I came back to help Yunyun with her trial, not to play around, so… Komekko, are you sulking because I ignored you? I’ll play with you a lot tonight, so please cheer up.
I don’t really care about playing with nee-chan, I just wanted a souvenir.
You don’t actually mean that, right!? You’re just saying that because you’re pouting, right? It really hurts, so please stop!
Yo, Komekko, it’s been some time. It’s Kazuma onii-chan. Here, I’ll give you a snack.
Welcome home, Onii-chan.
Komekko! You don’t have a brother, only a sister! Please properly welcome me back!
Have some tea.
Oh, my, thank you. You’re a pretty thoughtful girl, aren’t you, Komekko-chan?
Is this a present?
Komekko-chan, this girl isn’t food or a gift. In the first place, you shouldn’t eat any creature that looks this much like a human.
Now then, as the sister who’s been sending back money every month, I would like to learn more about this newly built house.
The old house went boom, so they built a new one.
I’ve heard about that before, but, be it the furniture or everything else about this house, they all feel like they are of far better quality than the stuff I’ve been using…
Nee-chan’s a cheapskate.
Where did you learn such words!? It must be that damned NEET Bukkoroli, right!? I’ll definitely ask Mother and Father about this house when they get back!
That’s how it is, so even though the house has been renovated, we are still broke! If you spare any thought for your mother at all, please don’t stop sending back the money!
I get it, so please stop pulling on my cloak! Everyone’s watching! It’s embarrassing, so please stop!
Well, it’s a good thing to have a bigger house. Ah, I’ll be in the village for a while, so Kazuma and the others will be staying here for a few days. Anyway, where’s my room?
…Eh? Umm, your room is…
Hey, hurry up and show your own flesh and blood daughter to her room. Otherwise I’ll stop sending money back to my cold-hearted parents.
You were living in such a gorgeous mansion, so I didn’t think you’d ever come back! There are several rooms free, so just take whichever room suits your fancy! I recommend the room at the back of the second floor! That room is wide and has thick walls, so you’ll be able to sleep together with Kazuma-san!
We’re obviously going to sleep in different rooms if you have the space! Don’t put your own daughter in the same room as a young man!
Kazuma-san wants to have the same room as my daughter, right?
Of course, isn’t that obvious?
You’ll just make things more complicated, so please shut up!
Hey, wait, didn’t you just ask me how many children I wanted the other day!?
That isn’t something to say in front of my parents! Anyway, that’s just talking about the future!
You can’t listen to what those two are talking about, okay? I’ll fold some origami for Komekko-chan. Behold, Bomber Majin Moguninnin.
So cool!
Megumin, you… ! You keep calling me Erosader and Erolady and all that, but since when did you come up with a family plan!? You closet pervert!
H-How rude! Who is a closet pervert!? Argh, nevermind! Kazuma, let’s go! I haven’t done my daily routine yet. We’ll just find a place to let it off.
Daily routine? Darkness-san, what exactly is my daughter’s daily routine?
Megumin does something that drains her stamina to the point where she cannot move every day.
Darkness, please don’t put it in such an easily misunderstood way! That sounds like I’m doing something really obscene!
By the way, because of the loud noises she makes during her daily routine, it’s become somewhat of a local spectacle in Axel. Recently, people have even come to watch…
Just what is my daughter doing in public!?
Explosion magic! I’m just shooting Explosion! Darkness, if you say any more misleading things to my mother, I’ll really make you suffer later!
Don’t think I’ll be happy just because you say you’ll make me suffer. I don’t hate you, Megumin, but I don’t think that sort of thing should be done between women.
I didn’t think about making you happy at all! Did the monsters knock something loose in your brain!? Enough of this, Kazuma, let’s go… Huh? Kazuma?
Succubus Lingerie Pub.
Oh, welcome, outsider. If you’re alone, will a counter seat be fine?
Umm, is this a regular pub?
Ah, the most intelligent Crimson Demon thought up the name for this pub and inn. Customers from outside the village all end up asking the same question.
Is that person also the same one who gave the name of “mixed hot springs
I’m surprised you know that. That very same person thought up the names for most of the tourist attractions in this village too.
Welcome, customer. My name is Nerimaki, daughter of the owner of the number one pub in the Crimson Demon Village, and the one who will eventually become its owner! Onii-san seems to be a friend of MeguYun, so I’ll give this to you as a special service. In exchange, would you please tell me how they are getting along in Axel?
W-What did you say!? That Yunyun has a male friend!? Go on! Tell me more about what kind of people those two guy friends of hers are like!
One of them is a blonde delinquent. The other one could be said to have a devilish personality, or even a devil himself…
How could this happen? Where did the pure Yunyun who helped me work on my finishing pose go… ! Those two always had a yuri-like air about them, so I’m sure they would’ve clung onto each other…!
By the way, I’m currently building an adult relationship with Megumin. I don’t dislike seeing yuri, but it’s a loss for humanity for two beautiful girls to get together. I intend to put my all into fighting the loss of population caused by the Demon King’s army.
That sounds really cool and all, but at the end of the day you’re just talking about making children.
Bro!? Is that you, bro!?
It’s me! The strongest, toughest, dancing and singing Divine Relic amongst Divine Relics! Your bro, Aigis-san!
What a coincidence to run into you here, bro! Could this be fate!? We might have pretty good compatibility with each other! If Kazuma-chi ends up reborn as a beautiful girl, I might let you get inside me!
Who the hell is Kazuma-chi? And don’t just call me bro.
Ojou-san, you probably can’t make any breast milk yet, so just give me some milk that’s the same temperature as your body.
Armour-san really sexually harasses everyone every night, don’t you?
Sexual harassment is a demonstration of affection, Ojou-san. You want to stick your finger inside me? It’s quite warm, you know?
You know the Crimson Demons are the strongest, most combative group there is, right? Picking a fight with them… You’re really amazing. There really is a fine line between bravery and stupidity.
So, what are you doing here? Didn’t you get taken away by Eris-san?
Oh, yeah, listen to this, Bro! She’s outrageous! She tried to give me to a swordmaster nii-chan! And yet another intolerable pretty boy too! He got mad when I teased the girls around him, so I ran away from home!
Well, I get that, but why did you come to the Crimson Demon Village of all places?
… The Crimson Demon Village is surrounded by nothing but strong monsters. That’s right, I gave him a trial! One to determine if he truly is a man fit for me!
Dear customer, didn’t you say ‘Ah, the Crimson Demon Village is full of beauties just like I heard! I’ll stay here from now on!’ the other day?
Now now, Ojou-chan, don’t say such things in a conversation between gentlemen. Here’s for the milk. Keep the change.
…Are those fragments of some sort?
They are pieces of my shining body. I’m made of Orichalcum, after all. You can probably make enough to buy a castle by selling me… You two are kind of scaring me here, so can you please stop looking at me like that?
Your face is too close, bro. Here’s the body temperature milk that this ojou-chan just brought me. It’s my treat, so chug it down.
Why did you order it if you can’t drink it? Anyway, will you be staying here for a while?
Well, I’ll probably go to an Eris Church to meet with my master again after I’ve had my fill of playing with the beautiful ladies here… Ojou-chan, haven’t I already paid for my stay in advance? Could you please stop scraping me?
Well, it’s great if you’re staying for a while. The truth is, I’m here to help someone with the trial to become the chief of this village. I might need your help at some point, so can I count on you if that happens?
Well, I’ll be free anyway, so I don’t really mind, but can you please stop this girl before she scrapes all of me away?
Sorry, I’ve come to pick up our two idiots.
Oh, it’s good that you’re here. Hurry up and take the two of them away.
… I’m really reluctant to do so, but I’m here to pick you up.
Where did you disappear off to last night, Kazuma? If you were here, we would’ve been able to avoid the Defense Corps with Enemy Detection and Lurk.
… You know, I really expected you to stop her.
I have nothing to say…
This will happen every day as long as I stay here, you know? So it’s best if everyone would just get used to it.
I have no idea what you’re saying.
Well, this girl claims that she’ll die if she doesn’t cast Explosion every day. The town of Axel is now treating it like a natural occurrence of sorts.
I really don’t get what you’re talking about at all.
Well, I guess it can’t be helped. I’ll try to finish it as early as possible from today onwards, so please inform the other villagers so that they won’t be surprised.
Say, I don’t suppose you could keep her here until we’re done with the trial? I can even pay you a fee if you want.
Please don’t, the Defense Corps isn’t a daycare for problem children. Please properly do your job as a guardian…
Hey, would you please stop treating a tender young girl as a troublemaker!?
- It doesn’t seem like we can take the Chieftain’s trial just yet. The grounds for the first trial have yet to be fully repaired…
What do you mean the trial grounds aren’t prepared yet? I’ve only been away for a short while, but it seems like the villagers have really let themselves go since then.
You were the one who destroyed the grounds in the first place! Actually, if Megumin could go somewhere else to play while the trial is going on…
Hey, why don’t you tell me exactly why are you treating me like an outcast!?
N-No, I’m not treating you like an outcast… It’s just, considering your personality, there’s no way you’ll behave yourself during the trial… and if there’s a place to show off at the end of the trial, there’s no way you can restrain yourself, right?
Yeah, makes sense.
Don’t just agree with her! Do you guys think I’m some sort of feral beast or something!?
Did you just forget where you were five minutes ago? Most people never see the insides of a jail cell.
Still, that doesn’t leave us with much to do. We already walked around the Crimson Demon Village the last time we were here, so what should we do now?
I want to plant this girl in the forest.
Umm… As a Crimson Demon myself, it’s a little troubling if you plant it close to the village… If possible, I think it’s best to exterminate it…
Can you really kill a girl this young!? Was Yunyun always such a cold-hearted person!? Come on, look her in the eye and say that again!!
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it’s impossible, forgive me!
Let’s put her on that hill overlooking the village. She won’t get lonely that way…
Aqua-san, that’s the Hill of the Demon God. It’s a popular spot for couples, so we can’t put her there. How about placing her deeper in the forest?
This is starting to be a chore. Why don’t we just plant her in Yunyun’s backyard? The people who live here won’t fall for the Tranquility girl’s tricks, so why don’t we just turn her into a new tourist attraction and be done with it?
As expected of Kazuma. She won’t be lonely like this, and Yunyun will end up making a friend too. It really is perfect.
I think it’s perfect too. I’ll properly treasure her.
What kind of stupid things are you saying!? Yunyun too, don’t agree so readily! Making friends with monsters is the one line you shouldn’t cross!
Say, Megumin, I thought of something that I’d do once I become the chief.
W-Where did this come from…? What do you have in mind?
I’ve been thinking about this for some time. Is it possible to capture monsters that have high intelligence and are capable of communicating to create a monster ranch in the village…
Isn’t that the same as what Kazuma was thinking!? Are you planning on turning them into experience points once they are grown up!?
T-That isn’t it! If they are provided with food, clothing and shelter, I’m sure the intelligent monsters will have a change of heart! This is the first step in finding a path of coexistence between mankind and monsters…!
What do you mean by coexistence!? What a barefaced lie! Do you want friends so badly that you’ll even turn monsters into NEETs!?
Of course I do! Isn’t that obvious!?
You know, I really don’t think there’s any option other than to put her in the forest far away from the village…
But she’d be lonely if we do that. Come to think of it, do Tranquility Girls have a gathering spot or something of the sort? She wouldn’t be lonely if we plant her next to others of her kind.
If such wicked creatures do have a gathering spot, I would burn it all to the ground.
Kazuma, you fiend! You’ll scare this girl, so go away!
Waaaah! Yunyun! Yunyun!
Light of Saber!
Snipe! Snipe! Snipe! Ahh, Yunyun! Yunyun! Save me!
Lightning Strike!
Oh! Those are the famous Paralyze Slimes! It’s a dangerous monster that paralyzes its prey before taking its time to digest it with its acidic body! Ordinary people would be dissolved along with their equipment, but if I were to be caught, my clothes and armor would go first! But don’t worry, Kazuma, I won’t give in to such humiliation…
Inferno!
… Yunyun, can I have a word?
What’s wrong, Megumin? I’m busy looking out for monsters with my Search spell right now… Ah, there are some monsters lurking around a short distance away from us. Leave it to me, I’ll wipe them all out in an instant.
You don’t need to! Actually, what’s with you today? You’re being unusually aggressive.
Do you really think so…? I mean, thinning out the monsters who are living around the village is also one of the duties of the chief, right? Plus I still have plenty of mana to spare, and I’ve brought plenty of manatite in case I run out…
You’re way too into this! Which country are you planning on going to war with by bring so many high quality manatite with you!? We’re a party, so there’s no need for you to charge on ahead!
Party… Hehe, Ehehe…
Stop doing that, it’s creepy! Why are you smiling when someone is lecturing you!? It’s rude!
Isn’t it fine? We should be thankful to Yunyun for taking all of them out. There’s no danger to us, and it’s smooth sailing, so there’s nothing to lecture her about.
Slime… Slime… Paralyze Slime…
There absolutely is! If Yunyun hogs the spotlight, there won’t be any chance for me to shine! I’m going to find strong monsters around here to use my Explosion on!
What did you come home to do!? We aren’t here to adventure or raise your levels, you know!?
Say, Kazuma, Megumin is being really troublesome, so let’s just let her shoot her Explosion off somewhere and carry her the rest of the way.
Yeah, she’d be less likely to do something unnecessary if she were to transform into luggage, so let’s do that.
I didn’t expect Aqua to say that! I won’t fire it off here! I came back home after all this time, so I am definitely not going to blow it on some small fry!
EXPLOSION!
What are you doing!?
Hey, I heard a really loud noise coming from the forest…
Megumin’s brain fried itself.
Wait, please, I know it’s my fault for letting loose without warning, but as I’ve said before, there’s a proper reason for that!
Yeah, yeah, sure you had a reason. Did you get too irritated? Or were you surprised after seeing a giant bug?
This man!
You just want us to listen to your excuses, right!? Stop stalling and tell us already!
Ugh… But you guys definitely won’t believe me…
I know that you won’t say anything irresponsible. Don’t worry, even if the others won’t believe you, I’ll properly hear you out.
Darkness…
So, what exactly happened?
The Bomber Majin Moguninnin appeared.
If you are going to say such stupid things, I’ll throw you off!
That why I didn’t want to say it! I knew none of you will believe it! Darkness, please lecture this man!
Er… umm… Well, I’m not that familiar with monsters… So Moganinnin was about to attack us. As expected of Megumin, you did a great job.
You didn’t even remember the name right, and your voice is completely monotone! Darkness, I thought I could trust you!
Claiming that Moguninnin appeared of all things… couldn’t you have found a better excuse?
Leaving other monsters aside, there’s no way I of all people could mistake any monsters that are related to Explosion! Moguninnin was staring at Kazuma from the depths of the forest! It’s that Bomber Majin we are talking about, so I doubt that my chantless Explosion could’ve destroyed it.
Just what is a Bomber Majin? You didn’t come up with it just to mess with us, did you?
Bomber Majin Moguninnin. It’s a mysterious monster that used to lie in a certain Mysterious Facility within the Crimson Demon Village. It is well versed in Detonation magic and can talk in a halting imitation of human speech, but no one can understand what it’s saying. It’ll attack anyone it sees apart from Crimson Demons, and will unleash Detonations without rhyme or reason at night.
That sounds like it has a really problematic personality. So, you’re saying that mysterious monster that sounds like it could be one of your cousins had its eye on me?
The Bomber Majin Moguninnin doesn’t usually come out from the depths of the forest, though…
You didn’t come up with that just so you’d have an excuse to let off your Explosion every day during your stay here, did you!?
How could you say that!? Do you really think I’ll come up with such a ridiculous story just because I wanted to let loose with my Explosion!?
Megumin was always saying strange things. Stuff like seeing a mysterious glowing object fly off towards the east, or that she was a God of Destruction in her previous life, or that a mage who uses Explosion will end up with big breasts…
You don’t believe a word of what I’ve said, do you!? You sure are bold for a NEET!
S-Shut up, me being a NEET has nothing to do with this! Anyway, stop using your Explosion magic in the forest. It gets really troublesome when you rile up all the monsters like that. At least behave yourself while the Chief’s trial is going on.
-Bomber Majin Moguninnin really was there. Kazuma, you mustn’t leave the village. Moguninnin has it in for all non-Crimson Demon men, particularly those with black hair and eyes.
Why does it have a grudge against such a particular target? In the first place, it doesn’t come out from the depths of the forest, right? Are you sure you didn’t misidentify a giant rhinoceros beetle or something?
There’s no way I could’ve mistaken a beetle for the Bomber Majin! Anyway, Kazuma, don’t participate as a partner in the Crimson Demon Trial. I’ve also been asked not to participate, so just leave it to Darkness or Aqua to be Yunyun’s partner.
Leave it to me.
Wait a minute, that’ll be a problem for me! Ah, no, I don’t mean I don’t want to partner with you two or anything!
The duty of a Crusader is to protect others. Don’t worry, just leave it to me. I’ll definitely protect you.
D-Darkness-san…
There’s nothing you need to worry about with me here. Even if you get killed by a powerful monster, I’ll bring you right back with Resurrection.
Aqua-sa… No, I’d prefer it if we didn’t have to use Resurrection in the first place…
Eh-… Trials and partners and all that gives it a proper fantasy feel for once, so I really want to give it my all…
Just watch the house with me, Kazuma. I’ll guide you around the village. There’s a pub that the parents of a classmate of mine runs.
Can we not go there? There’s a troublesome person staying over there.
Say, we didn’t manage to find a place to plant this girl…
Ah.
So, yeah, I really don’t have much to do tomorrow, so is there anything I could do to help out?
Oh, my, you’re offering to help? I’m going to gather materials for creating magic items from the deepest dungeon in this country tomorrow…
Sorry, is there something easier, like laundry or dishes that you could use some help with instead?
In that case, I’m a little concerned about Moguninnin, so would you like to explore that Mysterious Facility tomorrow?
Are you still stuck on that strangely named monster?
I wanna go too! The name ‘Mysterious Facility’ makes it sound like there’d be a ton of treasures hidden within it!
I’ve heard that it’s been explored many times in the past, so there probably wouldn’t be much left.
Come on, isn’t it fine to act like proper adventurers and go exploring every once in a while? Plus, with Kazuma’s luck, we might end up finding something good.
… Why must you choose precisely the times when I’m not around to act like proper adventurers…
Right, let’s turn in early in preparation for tomorrow. Don’t get too drunk now, Aqua. Now, then, I’ll go on ahead…
Yes, I suppose it’d be best to turn in early. Sorry, Kazuma-san, we don’t have much in the way of entertainment in my house… Though, playing around with my daughter in the same room should be pretty entertaining, heheheh.
What is this parent of mine saying!? Just what are you asking your daughter to do!?
When we talk about entertainment out in the countryside like this, there’s only one thing I could be referring to. Hurry up and let me see the face of my grandchild.
Please stop making lewd jokes in front of your daughter! Kazuma, you say something too!
Well, from a physical standpoint, I think it’s a little too early for your daughter to be giving birth. Maybe after she grows up a little more…
I’m already grown up enough to bear a child! No, wait, that’s not- Ah, what should I…
It’s already night out, so do try and keep it down. Also, you really should choose your words better. It’d be really embarrassing if the neighbours hear you say that you can bear a child and what not.
I don’t want to hear that from you! Just whose fault do you think it is in the first place!?
By the way, physically speaking, I think my body is ready to bear a child at any time.
What kind of stupid things are you saying now, Darkness!? Don’t butt in and go to sleep already!
Sleep.
Now, now, whatever happens next is completely up to you! The nights are long around this time of year, so go ahead and do as you please!
I’m sorry, even for me, laying hands upon a sleeping girl’s body is a little…
Such stuff should be done with the consent of both parties! I definitely cannot accept them crossing the line like this! Even if you are her mother-
Sleep.
… Even if you are her mother, I can’t overlook that! The duty of a Crusader is to protect others. I’ll protect Megumin’s chastity!
Y-You managed to resist it!? My sleep is supposed to be fairly powerful…
Tch…! Seems like you’ve leveled up quite a bit since the last time you were here!
Hmph, do you really think the same trick would work on a member of the Dustiness house twice!? Is Sleep the only spell you can cast!? Go ahead and render me helpless if you can!
Then how about this? Paralyze!
Weak! The Paralyze Slimes I saw in the forest today could put out a better numbing attack!
… Mmm… Behold my power… Release the forbidden seal… lay waste to all creation…
… Sorry, can I ask what are you doing?
I was watching the sleeping face of the person I love.
What do you mean person you love!? Why are you naked from the waist up!?
Well, when you wake up next to a half naked person of the opposite gender, you would normally think that something happened, right?
Of course! Isn’t this a really big deal!? Ah, wait, my bra is missing!?
I thought you might have trouble sleeping if you had something constricting your chest. Also, I heard that you’ll grow bigger breasts if you sleep without a bra.
I don’t need your concern over such matters! You don’t usually pay much heed to me, so why are you so concerned only at such times!? Even if it’s you, removing my bra while I’m sleeping…
Oh, don’t worry, I properly removed it with Steal like a gentleman.
Oh, how considerate of you! That goofy smile of yours is really infuriating! What would you have done if you accidentally took my panties instead!?
Now, now, calm down. It’d be boring if you thought nothing happened despite us sharing the same bed just like all the previous times, so I thought I’d give you a little surprise. Did I scare you?
Yeah you did! You really didn’t do anything, right!? I don’t want to become an adult without remembering any of it!
Don’t worry, you know me. I’m not that gutsy.
That’s pretty convincing, but it’s quite pathetic to hear that from the person I like!
Seriously, what kind of person is my mother… Casting Sleep on her daughter and letting her share a bed with a man, just how little common sense does she have…
Well, that lack of common sense just means that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
I’m not exactly opposed to that sort of relationship, you know? It’s just that, crossing the line because of my mother’s schemes while in my own home is a little…
Well, even if you say that, something will definitely interfere, right? I’ve been wondering if I’m under some sort of curse to remain a virgin for life. I’ve asked Aqua to check if I’m actually cursed several times, but she keeps saying I’m fine.
Just who exactly would put such a pointless curse on you?
There could be quite a few fans who wish for me to keep my purity. I’ve been exceptionally popular recently. I’ve heard that a beautiful adventurer who introduced herself as a fan of mine appeared in Axel’s adventurer’s guild.
… Will you meet with that person when you return to Axel?
Well, it sounds like she travelled a long way to meet me, so of course I’ll see her. Anyway, I’ll just give her a handshake and a signature and the like. I thought this might happen someday, so I’ve been practising my signature. I secretly left a signature on one of the pillars in the adventurer’s guild as thanks after all they’ve done for me.
The guild lady was really angry when she was cleaning it up. She told me to tell you not to scribble all over the walls.
What!? That pillar would’ve been able to fetch a high price in a few decades with my signature on it!
Then let me have your first signature… Satou Kazuma… I think that’s a very good name.
Hearing you praise my name makes me feel really conflicted somehow…
Hey, I just praised you, so explain exactly what you mean!
Um, Kazuma, can I say something?
I don’t think you should.
It’s kind of hard for me to say, but it’s hitting me. And it’s getting bigger…
Please don’t mind it.
I should say this, but don’t attack my precious son. He’s delicate on top of being shy.
I wouldn’t do that over a natural reaction. Plus, I’m the one who hugged you in the first place. Just how unreasonable of a person do you think I am?
You’re undergoing puberty too, so I can understand having some interest in the body of the opposite sex, but you still shouldn’t stare that much.
Ah, n-no, that’s not it! It’s just, I thought it might be hard on you on to have to bear with it every time…
… Umm, should I give you a hand?
Wait, what did you just say?
You’re taking this way too seriously! I-I asked if I should give you a hand…
Eromin! You really are a closet pervert like Darkness said!
And you’re being way too loud! Who exactly is a closet pervert!?
You were the one who said something really outrageous! Do you understand what you’re saying!? You want to give me a hand with this…!
Please stop emphasizing that part! I just thought that it’s a little hard on you to put up with these sorts of situation all the time, that’s all!
Hearing a girl younger than me with no experience offer to do something like that somehow feels more immoral than the act itself…
Your words are getting more and more obscene! You keep saying that I’m a vixen that does nothing but tease you without following through… I’m not very sure what to do, but, well, after getting excited like that, isn’t it pretty tough on you…?
Of course it’s tough! I even thought of you as a complete temptress!
Please stop calling me a temptress! I already said I’m fine with it if you’ll properly take responsibility!
So are you going to do it or not!? This situation is really embarrassing, you know!?
I’m embarrassed too! I’m about to instruct an inexperienced and awkward girl to do all sorts of things right when her mother is sleeping right below, you know!? Just how much do you think I have to pay for this sort of play in the shop!?
If you are going to do it, then hurry up and do it already! Stop explicitly spelling things out!
You suddenly sprung this on me! I haven’t mentally prepared myself! Yeah, yeah, I know, we’ll definitely be interrupted right before the good parts! I’m under that sort of curse after all! But even so, I can still get my hopes up! If anything, this sort of bittersweet back and forth is making me more excited!
Oh, I get it, I get already, so just take it off! No one has come in even after all the fuss we made, so I’m sure tonight will…
… See?
… … … Let’s have Aqua cast Break Spell on you tomorrow.
Hey, what exactly is this all about!?
That’s what we want to ask you, Megumin!
I don’t know what’s happening, but for now can you please let me go? I don’t think this is really something you should be doing to a girl.
… Well, I agree, but can you promise not to run away or start rampaging?
You let your guard down! I’m going to choke the life out of you!
Argh! M-Megumin you liar!
Would you keep a promise you made to the Demon King’s army or monsters? NEETs are existences even lower than slimes! Upholding a promise you made with such a creature is plain retarded!
H-Hey, Megumin, that guy is going to die, so let him go! And don’t pick on NEETs like that!
So, what’s all this about? What has our Megumin done this time?
You know about the explosion that took place in the forest last night, right?
We are very sorry! We’ll make sure this never happens again! Hey, Megumin, hurry up and apologize!
Don’t just apologize on your own, Darkness! Actually, stop assuming that it’s my fault just because there’s an explosion involved!
Then exactly who else would do this sort of thing?
Well, let’s start with establishing Megumin’s alibi. Who were you with and what were you doing last night?
… I-I can’t say that.
See, I knew you were behind it! Apologize for calling me a NEET and strangling me! … Actually, now that I think about it, that rash of explosions some time ago was done by you, right? You were the one who testified that those explosions were caused by a Devil that snuck into the village, right?
Megumin just reacted! And you can’t provide an alibi either, so that means-!
Why are you turning on me too, Kazuma!? The reason I can’t say it is because I was together with you last night! It’s too embarrassing to say out loud!
oh
I see… The Megumin I thought of as a younger sister has become an adult before I knew it… Sorry for disturbing your meal…
To think that Megumin, of all people… The world really is full of surprises. I had her pegged as the one furthest from any concept of romance…
We were just together, we didn’t do anything! Please don’t spread any strange rumours!
Just to be sure, it really wasn’t you, right?
You were there with me, Kazuma! In the first place, I already used Explosion yesterday when we were out trying to find a place to bury the Tranquility Girl, so why are you suspecting me!?
So what’s up with this situation? Is there another Megumin running around or something?
She isn’t a Slime, and I’ve never heard of Crimson Demons duplicating like that. Maybe she got her hands on some really high quality manatite without us knowing?
I’m not an accomplice, by the way. In the first place, I can’t transfer any mana to her without Kazuma.
Hey, I casted magic right in front of you three and have a proper alibi, so please stop suspecting me!
So, that explosion was…
The thing that Megumin was talking about…
Bomber Majin Moguninnin!?
Could you guys please stop saying that name.
If that’s the case, now’s not the time to be holding the Chieftain’s trial. If someone from outside the village gets hurt by that ninin, the number of tourists we get will go down…
Let’s discuss this with the chief. After that, we should send out a large party to go ninin hunting.
H-Hold on a minute, there isn’t a particular need to call off the Chieftain’s trial, is there?
There’s no particular rush to choose our next chief, but we need to deal with ninin as soon as possible. Besides, according to tradition, in order to become the next chief, one needs to either successfully complete the trial, or take down an impressive target with just two people. We can just let whoever takes down ninin become the next chief.
I might consider becoming chief if I don’t have to undertake that annoying trial to do so…
I’m sorry!
Megumin? Why are you suddenly apologizing?
… The one who caused the explosion last night was me. I was surprised by a large rhinoceros beetle while taking a night stroll and casted my spell by reflex.
What the hell did you do!?
See, I knew it was Megumin’s doing! My eyes aren’t made of glass! Apologize for strangling me and calling me a NEET!
I’ll apologize for strangling you, but I won’t apologize for calling you a NEET.
Why do you hate NEETs that much!?
Why did you say that!? Weren’t you having fun with me last night?
Having fun!?
Please don’t put it that way! And you didn’t need to respond, Darkness!
Well, knowing our tsundere, I bet she just didn’t want to interfere with Yunyun’s chieftain’s trial, right?
I see. Yeah, she can’t be honest whenever Yunyun’s involved.
Oh shut up, you two! Who exactly is a tsundere!? I’ve been disqualified from taking the trial, but if I can sneak away and take down ninin myself, I can steal the position of the chief…
(Hey, Kazuma, what exactly did you mean by having fun last night…? Megumin’s mother still managed to render me immobile in the end…)
(We slept in the same bed, and when that came up, Megumin…)
(W-W-W-What!? Just what did you make an innocent young girl do…!?)
(Don’t make it sound that bad! Unlike you who keeps leaving me whenever things start going, Megumin offered to take proper responsibility when that came up…!)
I can hear you two! What the hell are you talking about this early in the morning!?
G-Good morning, Darkness-san! I’ll be in your care today… Megumin, why is your face so red?
Hey, Yunyun, listen to this. Yesterday, Megumin and this man-
Nothing happened! Come on Darkness, hurry up and get out there!
-And this is the Mysterious Facility. We visited this place the last time we were here, but we never went inside, did we?
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, this is a laboratory, right?
Yeah, it totally is a laboratory.
What’s a laboratory? You two say some really strange things sometimes.
Noise Research Laboratory, huh.
You can read those words?
Say, Aqua, that Bomber Majin is the work of that cheat possessing Japanese guy, right? He made it and the Crimson Demons gave it that name, right? I’ve been thinking this for some time now, but aren’t most of the annoying problems in this world your fault?
What are you saying you shitty NEET!? It’s not my fault, it’s the fault of the Japanese with abnormal common sense. All I do is give them power and send them on their way. The ones who give monsters strange names and disrupt the ecosystem and spread strange words and bits of culture are the Japanese. I’d really wish they’d have some self awareness.
Stop talking about incomprehensible stuff and head inside already. There are a few traps lying around, so watch your step.
Then leave this to me. I picked up the Trap Detection skill for exactly these types of situations.
You can’t get any great accomplishments, but you’re really handy when it comes to little things like this.
Oh shut up.
Right, here’s the first trap. The door will suddenly open, but that’s just to make you let your guard down, so watch out for it. It might seem very inviting, but it will close after a second.
Say, Kazuma, can you let me handle the traps in this facility?
That’s no fair, I want to show off to Megumin by deftly avoiding these traps too.
Please don’t let your guard down! The area ahead of us is particularly dangerous!
Up ahead is a clean room. Please change into dust-proof workwear before proceeding.
Kazuma, Aqua, did you hear that? That mysterious voice is a warning. One must acquire and equip a Gustproof Workwear before carrying on. A violent gust blows at you if you enter the small room at the end. Right now it’s just air, but it must have sprayed a deadly acid in the past to prevent anyone without the proper equipment from entering…
It’s probably just an air shower to prevent dust from being brought into the clean room.
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, Megumin is really cute right now. She’ll definitely provide a really cute reaction if a TV was here.
That’s a fearsome trap that has resulted in a lot of casualties. A vile trap that devours anything that steps on that platform. It’s currently disabled now, but don’t let your guard down.
It looks to be some kind of assembly line. Did it break down?
The sign on the side says ‘Game Girl production line’.
You’re saying that this thing uses what it has consumed to create something… Could that thing be us Crimson Demons… Kazuma, I think I’ve just stumbled upon a truth that should never have been revealed…
This thing probably creates a toy.
The toy we found in that underground bunker, right?
You two don’t need to be that considerate. The Crimson Demons are a man-made race that goes against the laws of the gods… I’m sure my ancestors were created right here…
In the name of Aqua-san, I’ll forgive the existence of the joke tribe. After all, the Crimson Demons are really amusing.
Please don’t call us that!
Hey, Aqua, that’s a gachapon! There’s a gachapon here!
Oh, there really is. It’s empty, but that really is a gachapon.
Do the two of you know what that box is?
This is a gachapon machine. It spits out a capsule stored within in exchange for coins. Occasionally it’s used for raffles. I don’t know what it’s doing here, but it sure is nostalgic.
I don’t quite get it, but it’s a machine aimed at children, right? Then it has no relation to the creation of the Crimson Demons.
Crimson Demon modification rights available for a limited time only, it says.
Oh, it really is. First place, prototype Playscation, second place, Game Girl Color, third place, Crimson Demon Modification rights- Hey, what are you doing?
You two didn’t see anything, okay?
It isn’t okay at all, but I get it. Just buy me some wine later.
Don’t just erase the history of the Crimson Demons…
The only thing we learned is that Megumin’s ancestors came out from a gacha…
Wait, putting it like that will invite misunderstandings. At least say that the modification rights came from the gacha.
I’m back~ Komekko, let’s have dinner. Has mother returned yet?
Welcome back, Nee-chan. Mom’s gone into a dungeon, so she won’t be back today. The golden onee-chan is back, though.
Komekko, have you heard anything about Yunyun’s trial?
Yunyun said she passed the trial! But she was crying!
Yo, Darkness, I’m back. What happened with Yunyun’s trial? I’ve heard that she succeeded from Komekko, but…
…No more Crimson Demon Trials… You can be her partner tomorrow…
I originally thought that the trial was about answering riddles.
That’s my impression as well, but what could push you to such a state? The Chieftain’s trial is tough, but it’s something that could be overcome with two Crimson Demons. Just what happened? If it’s something unfair, I’ll go scold them for you.
Megumin destroyed out all of the magic items they use to create riddles… They also said they were tired of riddles, so they decided to go with something else…
So it’s your fault!
So what exactly did they make you do, Darkness?
‘The most important thing for a Crimson Demon is aesthetics! Strike a pose and name yourselves!’ they said, so they made Yunyun and me strike cool poses and name ourselves until they were satisfied.
Leave the trial to me today.
I feel a little uneasy leaving things to you, but Darkness is in no condition to participate…
Uuu… I don’t want that sort of embarrassment… that is not the kind I desire…
If you are looking for Megumin, she got taken away as the prime suspect for causing the explosion last night.
What is she doing!? And why is Kazuma-san so calm!?
Causing explosions and getting dragged away by the cops is just business as usual for her. More importantly, you’re taking your second trial today, right?
Y-Yes… I don’t think they’ll do something like yesterday’s trial…
Say, can you show me the poses you struck and the lines you said yesterday?
Absolutely not.
N-Now then, Aqua-san, shall we head off?
Yes, I’ll show you what I can do today. I’ve been thinking of special poses and ways to name myself last night, so I didn’t get much sleep, but you can look forward to my performance today.
N-No, I don’t think they’ll use the same thing for the second trial…
Now then, shall we go pick Megumin up?
Say, Kazuma, instead of going to pick her up every day, wouldn’t it be better to think of a way for her not to be thrown into jail in the first place?
Oh, hey, Kazuma, it’s your rival.
What are you talking about? The undefeated me has no rivals. Though, he does seem familiar somehow…
D-Did you really forget about him? He’s… umm, I think his name was…
It’s Mitsurugi! I thought the Lady of the Dustiness family was the most normal out of the bunch, but to think that you would forget my name too…!
Yo, it’s been some time. How’ve you been? Anyway, I’m in a rush, so…
Hold it! Why are you acting like you are avoiding me!?
Well, it’s not like we are that close. Plus, it’d be a bother if we get into a fight every time we meet.
W-Well, that’s true, but… No, more importantly, what are you doing here? The monsters around the Crimson Demon Village aren’t creatures someone of your level can handle.
A friend of mine is undertaking the Chieftain’s trial in this village, so I came here to help out. What about you? What are you doing here?
Well, this might sound crazy, but a divine relic of mine ran away… He left a note and went on a journey… Haha, it’s fine to laugh if you feel like it…
Seems like you’re pretty worn out… There’s a hot springs around here, so take your time and recuperate… And, um, don’t push yourself, okay?
Haha, it’s only natural that you don’t believe me… The truth is, the Goddess Eris-sama appeared in my dreams. She entrusted me with a very important divine relic and asked me to save the world with its power, but… one day, I woke up to a letter… ‘As you are right now, you are thoroughly unfit to wield me. You depend too much on the power of that magic sword. As a divine relic, I too have my own matters to attend to. Set off on a journey to find me while I’m off tying up a few loose ends, and become stronger in the process! I’ll be waiting for you. Now, Hero, rise up to the challenge’…
Afterwards, I’ve heard that there’s a skilled fortune teller in the Crimson Demon Village, so I came here to ask her to look into the divine relic’s whereabouts… But she probably thinks I’m pulling her leg too… She told me that he’s sexually harassing the waitresses at the pub, but that’s obviously facetious…
Well, that’s enough about me. It’s a trial that the divine relic Eris bestowed upon me set before me. I didn’t expect it to be so easy to overcome. Anyway, now that I’ve met you, I should pass on a warning.
The Demon King’s Generals have put the town of Axel in their sights… No, perhaps it’s more accurate to say that the Demon King’s army is aiming for Axel. I don’t know if their goal is the destruction of the town itself, or you, or perhaps even Aqua-sama, but if you aren’t confident about standing up to them, it’s best that you lay low in this village or the capital for awhile.
You defeated me once before. It’d be problematic if you were to lose to the Demon King. I’ll definitely beat you next time. And then, Aqua-sama will…
… Say, Darkness, doesn’t the way he put it make me sound like a main character of some sort?
No matter how you slice it, he looks much more like a protagonist than you.
Now, then, let’s go get Megumin-
… S-Say, Kazuma, getting Megumin back is nice and all, but maybe we could take a little walk before then? I mean, back in Alcanretia, we explored the city together too, didn’t we?
I don’t mind taking a walk, but I don’t know what Megumin will say if she found out that we went out to have fun without her.
W-Well, I thought we could do something date-like for once…
You know, now that I think about it, I don’t think I’ve ever gone on a proper date before…
R-Right!? No, I do think that walking around town together is pretty date-like, but I’ve always looked up to those storybook-style dates where you fuss over what to wear and arrive at the meeting point earlier than the appointed time-
So you have a maidenly side too. If you had this ojou-sama-like feeling back when we first met, I might’ve fallen head over heels for you.
Eh!? Is-Is that so? … I thought that such maiden-like hobbies wouldn’t be a good fit for a noble lady of a great house, but… I see…
S-Say, Kazuma, the weather is really great today!
Apparently the Crimson Demons use magic to control the weather, so it’s always sunny around these parts.
Look, Kazuma, a cat is taking a nap on that fence! It’s great that it’s peaceful out here.
That’s a Crimson Demon familiar. Apparently they’re there to monitor the area around the village.
Look, the elderly are leisurely fishing over there…
Ah, those guys are gathering up the monsters who live in the river. They are using steel cables for fishing lines, so they can send lightning based magic down the lines when they get a bite and level up that way.
… Kazuma, I don’t think this village is a good place for a date.
Well, it’s the home village of the famously combative Crimson Demons, after all. What, do you really want to go on a date that badly?
Of course! In the first place, you were trying way too hard to get me to fall for you!
That’s not how I remembered it! I lent you a hand and you fell for me on your own!
OーOn my own!? I fell for you on my own!? Who was it that barged into my wedding back when I was about to be married off to Alderp!? And you scattered your entire fortune in front of everyone and declared that you bought me or whatever before taking me away!
W-Well, I can’t help it, now can I?! It’s not like I can help being cool! I can’t help getting all kinds of accomplishments! Sorry for being cool! I’ll apologize for achieving all that glory! Yeah, normally everyone would fall for me, right!?
What glory!? Don’t get ahead of yourself! The only people who’d fall for a trashy man like you are weirdos like Megumin and me!
Do you like me or hate me!? Pick one and stick with it already! If you like me, then praise me more! There’s a fan waiting for me when I go back to Axel, you know!
Don’t tell me you actually believe that? It’s probably some scammer attracted by your wealth or fame. It’s a little strange for me to say this, but there’s no way a fan of you can exist.
S-Shut up! My only flaw is being unwilling to work! I’m otherwise a pretty good catch, you know!?
Being unwilling to work is a fatal flaw!
If Kazuma doesn’t want to work, I’ll just find a job to support you.
You’re being too soft on him, Megumin! This is why he’s becoming more and more slovenly!
You’re one to talk! Didn’t you say that your type was a trashy man who doesn’t work!?
You two sure seemed to be having fun while I was in the lock-up. Do you mind if I join in?
-I told her multiple times that we should go pick up Megumin, but Darkness…
Y-You were saying that you never went on a proper date or whatever too! N-No, Megumin, that’s not it, we haven’t been here in quite some time, so we were talking about going sightseeing…
You want a proper date, huh? So let’s go on a date with all three of us. I’ll guide you to some great shops.
That doesn’t sound like a date… No, nevermind…
Anyway, let’s go for lunch. There’s a restaurant I used to work at around the corner.
Yes.
-Welcome! Oh, hey, Megumin! It’s been a while. Have you learnt any other spells apart from Explosion?
Yes, it has been some time. I have no intention of learning anything else other than Explosion. There was a period of time where I considered learning Advanced Magic, but when I gave my card to Kazuma over here, he said ‘The only spell that suits you is Explosion. Only focus on pursuing the path of explosions…
I did not say that. I definitely did not go that far.
Oh, that’s good. We had a really long argument over what we would do if Megumin learnt some other spells.
Oh, so you called a meeting over my Explosion magic? Well, of course you would. Learning any other magic would be a waste of skill points, after all.
No, we were discussing your new nickname. The title of the Crimson Demon’s number one mage would become the one who calls down roaring thunder, I mean, Yunyun’s title, right? That’s why Megumin’s new title should be the number one joke mage of the Crimson Demons-
Hey, calm down, Megumin! Your opponent is an Archwizard! They have really low constitution, so don’t strangle them!
I too am an Archwizard, and a girl on top of that! I’ll show you the power of the joke mage!
Ten thousand eris on the joke mage!
Thirty thousand on the worst mage!
Fifty thousand eris on the Explosion mage!
Hey, I don’t mind you guys betting on me, but stop calling me by those weird names! Though, Explosion mage sounds cool, so I’ll let that slide… Oh, fine, I’ll take all of you on!
I don’t care what you do, just take it outside!
Are the two of you alright? Seriously, picking a fight with Crimson Demons… There’s a limit as to how reckless you can get.
You were the one who charged at them in the first place. Is that really something you should be saying? Anyway, it’s fine, isn’t it? Having scrapes like this from time to time really makes me feel like an adventurer.
Yes, as a knight, I couldn’t stand idly by as my companion is being called worst mage and joke mage. Plus, it was a pretty good match. I enjoyed myself quite a bit!
The guy who was facing you ended up begging you to let him off with tears in his eyes, you know? You really should stop getting others to satisfy your masochistic urges.
To us Crimson Demons, calling you the worst is somewhat of a compliment. It’s an ancient saying that anyone who is referred to as the worst would end up awakening to new powers.
That’s pretty cliche development, but… I really don’t get the sensibilities of you Crimson Demons.
Oh, Megumin? It’s been some time!
Hey, Arue. It’s really rare to find you outside considering how often you hole yourself up in your home. Are you still a NEET aiming to be an author?
I-I’m not a NEET! I’m a proper author! I’m writing for the Crimson Demon newspaper, and I even released a book recently! I’m earning money, so I’m not a NEET!
I-I get it, so stop pulling on my eyepatch! It’s something you gave to me! Plus it hurts!
Hey, Megumin, she’s the strange girl who mailed that scribbled story to Yunyun and caused us all kinds of problems, right!? I haven’t forgotten that!
Ah, you’re the outsider who tore up my manuscripts! I didn’t forget that either!
What’s the difference between an author and a NEET anyway?
I’m a Crimson Demon! If you make me angry, I’ll blow you away with Advanced Magic!
You two shouldn’t have had much contact with each other, so why are you two fighting from the moment you meet!? Calm down!
You must be one of Megumin’s classmates. I’m Darkness, of the same party as Megumin. I’ll only be in the village for a short time, but please take care of me.
My name is Arue, the number one author of the Crimson Demons. I’m relieved that onee-san seems to be a sensible person. Nice to make your acquaintance.
Hey, why is there such a big difference in the treatment we are getting? And you sure are introducing yourself in a really grandiose way! Why don’t you tell me exactly how many authors there are amongst the Crimson Demons before calling yourself the number one?
Isn’t it obvious to proceed in a friendly manner with one of Megumin’s companions? I would’ve treated you the same way if you hadn’t hurt me before. As for the number of authors amongst the Crimson Demons, I have no comment.
Oh yeah, come to think of it, I haven’t heard any of the Crimson Demon’s flashy introductions since I came here.
You know you only introduce yourself when you meet someone for the first time, right? By the way, I’m not doing that to you. You don’t seem like a good person.
I’ve heard that Megumin made a boyfriend, but don’t tell me this is the guy in question? Don’t think too badly of me for saying this, but it’s still not too late to go back to the Yunyun route.
Is that a declaration of war, you one eyed woman? You said you just released a book, right? If I find any of your books in a bookstore, I’m going to put them beneath other author’s books.
Megumin, this man is no good! I’ll get rid of him right this instant!
Oh, you want to go? My Steal is pretty unique, you know? Don’t think that your eyepatch or panties will be safe!
If you two insist on fighting, then I’ll be your opponent! Don’t think that a high level Archwizard will have any trouble taking on a pair of NEETs!
I-I’m not a NEET!
Waaaaaah! Bwaaaaah! Waaaaaah!
What happened? Striking a few embarrassing poses shouldn’t be that traumatic after all the embarrassing stuff you did. Just what exactly did they make you do?
Uuu…uuu… Today’s trial was… ‘What a Crimson Demon needs above all is luck. You two can attempt this challenge as many times as you want until you pick the right door’, they said, before shoving us towards a series of doors…
Still, you managed to pass the trial, right? Good work, go ahead and take a bath. In the meantime, I’ll whip up some high quality snacks for you with my cooking skill.
… Shiokara would be nice…
Megumin’s mother, um… t-tonight…
Don’t be so distant, just call me Yuiyui.. Anyway, what about tonight? Darkness-san seems to be in heat tonight.
In heat!? No, I mean, could you not have Megumin and Kazuma sleep in the same room tonight…
Why should they not? Do you want to have a secret rendezvous or something?
Secret rendezvous!? No, of course not! It’s just, a lot of things happened today, so thinking that they’ll share a room on this day gives me a sense of alienation…
Did something happen today?
Not at all. Darkness just got carried away on her own.
Whaー!? Hey, Kazuma, after going on that date, that’s a little-
-Yahoo! It’s a fourteen year old girl’s bed!
You little- Why must you bring focus to that of all things?
It’s a 14 year old’s bed, you know? A 14 year old, not a 15 year old’s. It’s a very precious thing, so I thought I should say it out loud.
I really don’t get what the big difference is. Girls’ beds are all pretty much the same…
Well, if I were to start going into the specifics, we’d be talking until dawn, so let’s leave that to another day.
I’ve always had this impression, but you’re not a lolicon, right? You didn’t fall for me because I’m small, right?
How rude, I properly like huge breasts. Ones like what Darkness has are my ideal body type.
I didn’t ask the specifics of your ideal, but as long as you aren’t a lolicon… You seemed really happy to have Komekko and Iris look up to you, so I was a little worried…
Well, I feel like a war will erupt if I go into the specifics of that, so let’s leave it to another day.
I-Is that so… Well, I didn’t really care that much. Anyway, there’s not much else to talk about, so let’s hurry up and turn in.
Say, why are you sleeping so far away from me? We’re already at the stage where we use arms and chest as pillows and the like, so is there really a need to hold back like this?
Of course there is, if I get close to you, you’ll end up having to bear with it, won’t you? I’m doing this so I won’t raise your hopes unnecessarily.
My hopes were already raised from the moment we ended up in the same bed, so it’s a little too late for that.
Do men really think about nothing but that!? Something will end up interrupting anyway, so nothing will happen!
There is the possibility that the person who cursed me is the Demon King that even Aqua has trouble dealing with…
Just holding hands is fine, right? You won’t start feeling pent up like this.
Of course I will, what are you talking about?
Even this!? Er, well, my heart’s starting to beat really fast too, but if you have to say, shouldn’t this be more comforting?
Since you’re so afraid of loneliness, we can hold hands while we sleep tonight, but you really should pay more attention to yourself. Don’t do this with anyone else. They’ll definitely get the wrong idea and eat you up.
There’s no way I’ll end up in this situation with anyone else! Why are you using that ‘Ahh, it’s a good thing I’m such a gentleman’ tone of voice!?
Ouch, that hurts! Your level is a lot higher than mine, so be careful! You might end up crushing my hand if you use too much force!
There’s no way my strength would be that monstrous! Actually, you should really raise your levels. I’ll go with you on as many monster extermination quests as you want.
Even if you say that, do you understand the pain of not seeing your status rise even though you leveled up? Recently, apart from my luck, my stats barely rise at all. Having more skill points is nice and all, but as a NEET, there aren’t that many skills that are beneficial to my lifestyle. I’m having trouble finding the motivation to level up…
You’re reaching your stat cap, huh… Hmm, well, there are several expensive potions that can permanently raise your stats. We can defeat monsters and use the money we earn to buy those potions and get stronger that way…
Rather than using such potions on me, wouldn’t it be better to use it on people who are already talented in the first place? It’s not like these potions grow on trees, right?
… Then, we can at least do something about your equipment…
My strength isn’t very high, so there aren’t that many items that I can properly use.
…You’re pitying me, aren’t you?
N-No, if there’s anything I can do, feel free to tell me. That includes when someone bullies you. Anytime I run into an adventurer who calls you weak, I’ll make sure to pick a fight with them and respond with, ‘Seems like you are the weak one,’ when I beat them…
Stop doing that! So that’s why adventurers I never met before were calling me Weaklingma-san who needs a girl to protect him!
But you and Darkness got angry when I was being made fun of today, didn’t you? So why can’t I get angry when you are being made fun of?
I was really happy when you two got involved in the fight, you know? The way things were going, I would’ve lost due to being outnumbered. Well, if I did lose, I would’ve sent my thanks each night to the houses of those who teased me that day…
Anyway, who’s going to be Yunyun’s partner for tomorrow’s trial? The first two trials were just them playing around, but the last trial is going to be pretty tough. The most important trait that we Crimson Demons as modified humans need is the ability to survive in any battlefield. The last trial would be to survive a night in the forests where the strong monsters make their nest.
… They sure became serious all of a sudden. Darkness can withstand a lot of attacks, but she can’t land her blows, and it’d be really bad if Yunyun ran out of mana. And Aqua would probably just attract a horde of undead if she were to spend a night in the forest…
Before you say it, I can’t let you, with your black hair and eyes, compete while the ninnin is still wandering around out there.
… Should we search for a Crimson Demon to be Yunyun’s partner tomorrow?
Don’t do that. Walking around and asking if anyone would be Yunyun’s friend would be like some sort of punishment. She’ll probably cry.
You can’t, okay? The one out for you is the Bomber Majin. Aqua can’t resurrect you if you get blasted to ashes by a Detonate.
Even if you say that, we don’t have anyone else to partner with Yunyun. You’re also keeping quiet about the Bomber Majin so that Yunyun’s chieftain’s trial won’t be disrupted, right?
… That’s not true at all. Didn’t I tell you before? By keeping quiet about ninnin, I can take him down before anyone else and steal the position of Chief that way.
Oh, that’s a tsundere alright.
… It’s true that Yunyun is a very important friend. From a purely pragmatic standpoint, rather than me who doesn’t want to get too far away from Axel, or the others who aren’t that into it, Yunyun is best suited to be the chief. But…
Whenever I see you risking your life for someone else, I feel really jealous for some reason.
Say something! Keeping silent just makes me feel embarrassed!
I’m the one who’s embarrassed! What are you saying!? My face is getting hot enough to cook eggs, so can you please cut it out!?
Anyway, don’t participate in tomorrow’s trial, okay!?
Yeah, yeah, I get it! There’s no way I can participate after you gave me such a passionate appeal. We’ll think of some other way.
Passionate appeal!? Er, I can’t deny that it isn’t passionate, but… Ah, nevermind, we have to get up early tomorrow, so let’s hurry up and sleep already.
Hey, weren’t we going to sleep while holding hands tonight?  I want to sleep while holding onto a 14 year old girl’s hand all night.
You’re really great at ruining the mood!
You foolish Crimson Demons! I’ll lay waste to this entire village!
I told you when we let you out of the cells yesterday! If you cause another scene with your Explosion, you’ll be tossed into the cells until the chieftain’s trial is over! So behave yourself! Gurk, I’m pretty high level too! Even if you strangle me like that…
She’s starting to chant! Cover her mouth! Don’t let her chant!
Watch out, she’s really strong! Think of her as a rabid beast!
Ahhh! Bukkoroli! Hey, get Megumin’s hands off him! Bukkoroli is foaming from the mouth!
Yunyun! Go ahead and attempt your final trial or whatever while I’m in jail! But don’t think you’ve won yet! If you still aren’t chief by the time I get out, I’ll take over that position!
Megumin, please let go of Bukkoroli! Otherwise we’ll need to use Resurrection!
Anyway, about Yunyun’s final trial…
I’m definitely not participating.
I-I… Erm… Well…
Why are the three of you so calm? Megumin is getting dragged away again, you know!?
… I was Yunyun’s partner during the first trial, and Aqua was her partner during her second trial, so wouldn’t it be fitting for our leader Kazuma to be her partner for the third trial?
Darkness is saying something great for once. Yeah, let’s leave it to Kazuma who hasn’t done anything up till now.
Unfortunately, I can’t participate. Moguninnin is around, after all.
Seriously, what is a Moguninnin?
Well, personally, I really want to take the trial, but after everything Megumin said to me, it’d be a jerk move to ignore her and participate anyway. Though, I do think it’d definitely go smoothly if I joined up…
Aaa… But I have no one else to ask other than Kazuma-san…
Well, I do know of one guy who’ll definitely let you clear that trial.
This is the divine relic Aigis.
Just like what he said, my name is Aigis. My hobby is rating girls and my special skill is enraging others. Nice to meet you.
Er… H-Hello.
D-Divine relic… Hey, Kazuma, what are you saying? This set of armour is a divine relic?
Hmm? This blonde lady seems familiar… Oh, I know, it’s that girl with that erotic body who appeared in the beauty contest! Yo, ojou-san, I’m Aigis. You’re wearing some pretty good armour. Wanna polish them together someday?
What’s with this vulgar suit of armour? Kazuma, is this thing really a divine relic?
Don’t ask me, ask Aqua. And he himself says he’s a divine relic.
Hey, Kazuma, I don’t know anything about this. Don’t just push everything to me.
Hmm? I think I’ve seen you somewhere before. Strange. Even though she’s a beauty, I don’t have any reaction towards her at all. Say, onee-chan? Are you human? Or perhaps you are a man? You’re not packing anything down there, are you?
Can I really pass the trial for sure if I teamed up with him?
Skills and magic doesn’t work on him, and on top of that, his entire body is made out of orichalcum. The final trial is to spend a night in the forest, right? He is tougher than Darkness and constantly boasts about having an impenetrable defence, so I think you’ll be fine with him.
What did you want me to do? Sorry, but I have an appointment to be the figurehead of the mixed hot springs tonight. I need to protect those naked and defenceless onee-chans from the shadows.
Just so you know, the mixed hot springs are neither mixed nor hot springs.
Are you kidding me?
Kazuma, will he really be of use? Sure, he looks tough, but I can’t help but worry about leaving him and Yunyun alone together.
Oh, I can’t let that slide. Do you doubt my abilities? In that case, why don’t you try me on yourself? Nothing beats the hands on experience. You won’t want to wear anything else after trying me on.
Grr… Fine, if you’re going to go that far, I’ll try you on. I’m fairly experienced when it comes to armours too.
That’s more like it. But don’t come crying to me afterwards. My internal structure changes to fit its wearer, creating a perfect fit to ensure maximum performance at all times.
In other words, it’d be just like an order made suit of armour!? Now you’ve got my expectations up. Don’t disappoint me now.
Now then, to start with, you need to strip. It might be a little embarrassing,  but your underwear needs to go too. It’s necessary in order to ensure maximum performance.
I-Is that so… W-Well, it’s just a piece of armour. It’d be stranger to be concerned about it… Let’s just go over there…
You didn’t have any issues back when you made Eris-sama wear you, did you?
Don’t say that now! This girl was this close to falling for it!
I-I’ll break you to pieces!
U-Um, Aigis-san, I have a request!
What is it, big breasted onee-chan? Go ahead and say it.
W-Would you be my partner for today’s trial!?
Is that like inviting me on a date? As you can see, I’m a little preoccupied right now. Do you mind stopping this muscle headed girl?
Yunyun, this guy is no good! Let’s think of another method! For example, it’s a little unfair, but how about having Aqua, Kazuma, and me take it in turns to help you…
Hey, Kazuma, you should be a little more prudent. Look, the pure and upright noble lady is now saying saying such things.
It’s not my fault, she recently even started to learn how to abuse her power. I’m sure her true nature as a noble has awakened.
Oh, shut up! In the first place, we already changed partners between trials. Was it ever written down that you can’t change partners within a trial? If there isn’t…
Look, Kazuma, Darkness is even saying the same type of sophism that you come up with.
Don’t just blame everything on me. I’m not this devious.
… No, I want to have a proper trial. Then, this time, Megumin will…
Oh, the brilliant me had a great idea. Ojou-chan, register this place as a teleport destination and let’s spend the night at some other town. We’ll teleport back here at dawn. The forest is really scary at night… Actually, you could just scream and cry and have the judges let you off!
Kazuma-san suggested the same thing when he heard about what this trial would be. But I won’t cheat. I want to become the chief with my own strength…
It’s honestly kind of shocking that Kazuma had the same idea.
Say, Ojou-chan, why are pretty girls so soft? Why do they smell so nice? I think I should study that and write a paper on that subject. I’m sure it’ll be an asset to this world.
I think it’s fine to do whatever you like, but why did you bring it up all of a sudden?
Nah, it’s fine if you don’t get it. Say, ojou-chan, do the people around you ever call you dense and a poor judge of character?
I don’t think so…
For armour type divine relics like me, it’d be better for there to be someone inside me, don’t you think? Like, you pry open this armour and a pretty girl is inside! I think the customers would be very happy to chance upon such a gap.
I don’t really get what you mean by customers, but is that the case?
Aigis-san, is it really fine for you to be fooling around out here? Aren’t divine relics created by the gods to fight against the Demon King?
Hmm? But that’s boring. I mean, sure, if a pretty onee-chan is about to be subjected to the Demon King’s perverted tastes, I’ll go save her, but there isn’t any hint of that. Not to mention that the Demon King Army’s demon girls and monster musumes are pretty appealing. I’m having trouble deciding which side I’d rather be on.
I’ve heard that the Demon King Army’s ultimate goal is the eradication of humanity. Wouldn’t the pretty ladies be wiped out too?
Well, yeah, that’d be a problem~. In that case, I’ll get as many of the pretty girls I can find and have them stay by my side so I can protect them. That way Eris-sama wouldn’t be angry too. Sadly, my new master is just too hard headed to get along with.
Anyway, that’s enough about that, what do you plan to do after becoming chief? How about making a law to have the robes of the Crimson Demons extend for no more than five millimeters from the waist?
I won’t do that! I’ll be kicked out from the first day!
Well, if you want to be chief that badly, I’m sure you have a dream that can’t be accomplished without becoming chief. How about letting me in on it? Do the Crimson Demons have some great secret?
I don’t have any such dreams that requires me to become chief to accomplish. And, even stuff I want to do…
Eh? You’re kidding! Then there’s no need for us to try this hard, is there? Why don’t we live a little more enjoyable life? How about coming with me on my journey to befriend beautiful women all over the world?
That sounds nice! Ah, I don’t really care about the beautiful women part, but travelling around the world and befriending a lot of people…
To be honest, I didn’t expect them to accept me as a partner. You Crimson Demons really are a free-spirited bunch, aren’t ya? I was really surprised when a bunch of them froze the lake just so they could go fishing for wakasagi in this season. Aren’t there more worthwhile ways to use your powers?
Oh boy, monster right ahead! Ojou-chan, go ahead and let loose with your magic! Don’t worry about running out of mana, I, Aigis-san, shall protect you…
Leave it to me! I’m the one who will become the Chief of the Crimson Demons! Combat is my greatest talent!
That’s the way, Ojou-chan! I really love girls like you! The first enemy is a One-strike bear. I really hate them. Their attacks really hurt.
I’ll do my best not to leave even a scratch on your armour! Leave the offense to me!
INFERNO!!
… I can’t use magic or skills when I’m wearing you, Aigis-san…
Yeah. To a spellcaster, I’m a surprisingly worthless piece of junk.
A-Anyway, what were you saying just now? I recall you saying something about amazing compatibility and being my friend!
Ah, sorry, that was nothing. Anyway, do something about Kuma-chan here.
No, you definitely said something! I definitely heard you call me your friend! There’s no way I could’ve misheard that!
What’s with this girl!? Did I step on a landmine? Anyway, do something about this bear! Even if you can’t use magic, you’re still a high level Archwizard, right!? My defence is stupidly high, so please do something!
Oh, yeah, that’s why I have my dagger… Ah, but that’s an important memento from my first shopping trip with a friend…
Are you okay!? Is this girl right in the head!? Hey, once we’re done here, can you get out of me for a moment? Let’s start things over from the beginning!
My name is Yunyun, an Archwizard who wields Advanced Magic…
The strongest spellcaster amongst the Crimson Demons, and the one who will eventually become chief!
It’s ringing inside me! It’s really ringing! Hey, hurry up and get out of me, Ojou-chan! Otherwise I’ll get shaken to pieces!
Chief! Chief!
I always knew that Roaring Thunder Yunyun would make it someday!
Hey Yunyun, we’re friends aren’t we? Let’s go hunting in the forest next time!
This is a joyous occasion! Tonight is the birth of the strongest chief!
Ahahahahahaha! Hey Kazuma, look at this! Megumin is multiplying!
I am not multiplying! Aqua, you drank too much! Darkness, please stop her…
The Dustiness House will not give in! I have resistance to poison as well. There’s no reason to decline such a challenge!
That’s the spirit! Now, now, drink with me, Darkness-san! If I lose, I won’t meddle any further with my daughter’s and Kazuma’s relationship!
Why don’t you drink as well? Even Darkness who usually stops you is already drunk.
Ugh… I’d very much like to do that, but…
Wh-what are you doing? Are you two drunk!? After taking out all those powerful targets, my level is far higher than the both of you! If you don’t mind getting thrown around, then feel free to come at me!
Come talk with us for a bit! It’s about time you come clean with how far you’ve gone with that guy!
Yeah, yeah, you’re always so arrogant! We’ve never seen you act like a maiden at all! How did you, the one with the least sex appeal out of all of us, end up like this!?
Yeah, yeah! And could you introduce us to some male friends of yours too!? It’d be too cruel to ask Yunyun to introduce us to her friends!
You guys are some really troublesome drunks! Don’t let Yunyun hear you, she’ll cry!
—Chief! Chief!
Chief! Chief!
W-Wait! I’m only the next in line. You’ll make my father sad!
How do you do! I’m the one that became one with your next chief in line, Aigis!
Aigis-san! Please don’t put it like that! I just went inside of you!
That’s right, you just went inside me and exerted yourself, right!
Wh-What is the meaning of this? I don’t remember raising a daughter who would let inanimate objects do as they please with her body!
Father what are you saying!? Aigis-san too, please don’t put it in such a weird way..!
Your daughter smelled really good, it was just the best! Also, her body temperature was high, so it was really warm.
Lightning Strike!
I’m resistant to magic you know. But I understand your grief, father! Don’t hold back and hit me as much as you’d like!
D-D-D-Don’t call me fatherrrrrrr!
Gurk, m-my hand…!
Are you alright father? I’m sorry, but I’m made of orihalcum. Also, your daughter was very soft!
Raaaaargh!
Aigis-san, please stop teasing my father!
Hey, Dodonko, Yunyun and that armoured man are getting on really well!
Hey, what’s the meaning of this! You look so innocent, but you’re actually doing stuff like this behind our backs!?
You keep talking about making friends this and making friends that, but you seem to have no problem making boyfriends! Hey, Yunyun, we’re friends, right!? Please, introduce me to a cool onii-san!
Now, now, ladies, don’t quarrel over little old me.
I have no idea what the two of you are saying! Please calm down! Also Aigis-san, stop butting in!
Hey now Aqua, Darkness, you’ll catch a cold if you sleep here… You too mother, please wake up. If you’re going to sleep, please do it at home.
Komekko, are you sleepy because you stuffed yourself? I’m sorry, but please help me carry your mother home.
That’s a pain, just leave her here and go home. I’ll ask father to come here later…
Komekko, no matter how much of a pain they are, you shouldn’t just leave your parents alone!
Are you sure you don’t want to join them?
If I go there now, I’m sure I will be compared to Yunyun. I’m already being known as the joke mage, so I’m not going to go out there just to be made fun of.  Besides, that loner of a girl being surrounded by everyone like that is a pretty unusual event for her. It seems all the hard work she put in really paid off.
So she finally surpassed me.
… So, is your rivalry finally settled with this?
Of course not, our gap as rivals just got larger, is all. Someday, I’ll achieve something that’ll make all the Crimson Demons envious. Say… taking down the Demon King with my party, for example?
I definitely won’t go with you on that one, ok? No matter how much you cry or scream or tantrum, I’m definitely not doing that.
Then how about this, if we defeat the Demon King, I’ll do anything you want.
Did you just say anything…
I said it, didn’t I? Anything means anything.
Please don’t call me easily tricked, I’m pretty conscious about that. I used to be a much sharper girl in the past, so how did things turn out like this…
Say, Megumin, you still haven’t done your daily routine today, right?
Yeah. I was going to fire it off in the sky during the climax of the celebration, to give all those drunks a surprise…
It’s a rare celebration for Yunyun, so why don’t you just let it slide tonight?
It’s precisely because it’s my rival’s celebration…
Oh fine,
Say, how about we sneak out of here together?
…Do you want to do perverted things that badly? Really, this guy…
T-That’s not it!
Then what do you plan on doing after we sneak out? If we go missing under such circumstances, we’ll definitely be teased about it tomorrow…
…?
Let’s go do your daily routine right now!
Hahahahahahaha! Look Megumin, the One-Strike bear is multiplying!
It’s not multiplying! Kazuma, how much did you drink just now!?
I did drink a little, but I’m not drunk, so it’s fine!
It doesn’t look the least bit fine at all! If it was the usual you, you would surely be screaming at the sight of the One-Strike bear!
Hey, hey, little bear, are you scared!? I am Kazuma! Catch me if you can!
You’re drunk aren’t you? You’re actually very, very drunk, aren’t you?
Roooooooooooooar!!
Snipe!
Rawr!?
Behold Megumin! This is the true power of the Hero Kazuma! What do you think, isn’t it cool??
It looks cool! It looks very cool, so please keep running! Where did you hit it? It looks like you really pissed it off!
Oh, it’s a male isn’t it. I struck its sweet spot!
Now’s not the time for that! What have you done!?
Hold it right there, it’s way too early for that. You sure are a hasty one, aren’t you?
Mmff!? …Fuaa! Why did you interrupt me? It will catch up to us at this rate, you know!? Can’t I just blow that bear up!? It’s more than sufficient to be my target.
That kind of small fry is not a suitable match for your magic. Explosion magic is the strongest magic, so don’t you misuse it!
What is with you tonight, Kazuma!? Did you get more drunk after running around!? Normally you’ll just tell me to get it over with!! Actually, if I don’t use it now, we’ll get done in by that small fry!
Did you forget who I am? That’s right, I’m Kazuma, the one who possesses the Lurk skill!
It’s already found us! I’m begging you, please return to normal!
Create Earth
Wind Breath!
Grah!?
Hey, Kazuma… Wai—
Heh… You said that you’ll let me do anything to you just a short while ago, but you’re getting tense now?
Of course I’m tense! Are you stupid!? Kazuma, are you seriously stupid? I’m tense because my life’s on the line here!
Sniff, Sniff…!
So, how is it Megumin? A date in the middle of the night just gets your heart pounding, doesn’t it?
My heart is pounding! It has never pounded like this before! I’m begging you, please keep quiet!
In the end, it’s a mere beast… It was never a match for me.
If you had that kind of confidence all the time, we’d be able to go on more adventures…
Ok, let’s go this way, Megumin. I can sense the aura of a powerful monster over there.
It doesn’t have to be a powerful one! Just what is with you tonight? Even if you are drunk, this is way too strange!
You were the one who always said you loved going for the strong ones.
Yes, I love going for the strong ones! However, that’s when we are with everyone, and when Kazuma is acting with a clear head!
Seems like it’s here. Now, I wonder if this one can properly satisfy me?
Stop saying stupid things and run, Kazuma!! Those blue eyes that shine in the dark! That is the lone wolf, champion of the forest, Fenrir!
Normally I would hunt you down for some pocket change, but it seems like you’re not the one I’m looking for tonight. I’ll let you off this time, so count your lucky stars…
Just where is all of that confidence coming from!? This is Fenrir you know!? This is a extremely high leveled enemy that wiped out even those veteran adventurers who were capable of dealing with the dangerous white wolves with ease!
I see, you control ice. What a coincidence, I too command both water and ice. Would you like to see who is better?
There’s no way that your sorry Freeze spell can even compare! Oh, never mind, I’ll take care of this, so just buy me some time…
This is not your time to shine. Save that for later. Now then, little puppy, it’s about time we get started with our late-night ball. Won’t you dance with me!?
You would normally never say stuff like that! Seriously, just what it’s with you!? Though, it pains me to admit it, but it was actually a little cool!
…Kazuma, it’s looking down on you. It’s really looking down on you!
No, it’s not looking down on me, it’s trying to get me to lower my guard. Unfortunately, that’s not going to work. Create Water!
Kazuma, he seems like he’s enjoying it! Based off its attributes, the Fenrir should like water and ice! It thinks you’re giving it a bath!
Heh… if it’s that comfortable, how about another round? Create Water! Create Water!
Did you lower your guard because my level is lower than your? Too bad, but this match is already decided. Create Earth!
!?
Didn’t I say this battle was already decided! Wind Breath!
Gra!
Bind!
Gruu! Grrrrrrrr, Frrrrrrr!
A-Aah… N-N-No way, to think that Kazuma could render a Fenrir powerless so easily…
Well, that was pretty fun. It’s about time to finish this…
So cool…! Kazuma is really cool tonight..! But, even if you disabled it, it’s still dangerous to approach a Fenrir. You should safely finishing it off from a distance with your bow…
I don’t like picking on weaklings. This one is pretty good. It just picked a fight with the wrong person..
If I don’t have a sword, then all I have to do is create one. Create Water!
At the very least, I will finish you with an attack from your favourite element. Freeze…!
Ah… Aah… Aaaah…
This is the true use of Freezing magic!
Th-That’s so cool! You’re so cool! Tonight’s Kazuma is just too cool!
Seems like my magic was superior after all. Now, it’s time for you to take an eternal rest—
I would like to take back those words I said about how cool you were tonight!
Yeah, of courseー, even if it’s made with magic, ice is still iceー Of course it wouldn’t pierce the fur of a boss level wolfー
Stop saying such carefree words and hurry up! A wolf’s sense of smell is especially good, so it might even sniff through your Lurk skill!
Well, it really did look like it was my victory there.. Plus I said I’d let him off before we fought, so finishing him off would go against my word.
Why are you being so positive!? Let’s go back already. It’s not just Kazuma who’s strange tonight, the forest itself is strange too! Fenrir is supposed to be living far deeper in the forest…
It detected the presence of a strong enemy, that’s to say, me, and came all the way out here.
You drunkard!
I’m sensing an enemy even stronger than the Fenrir. Could this be it?
I give up already, do as you like! Now that it has come to this, I may as well accompany you ‘till the end! Even if my opponent is Fenrir, a dragon, or even the Bomber Majin…!
Well said! Tonight’s objective is the Bomber Majin Mogunin. It’s time to blow away that thing with a festive sounding name
Please don’t shorten it to Mogunin, it feels like you’re messing up my name! No, wait, I might not be qualified to be asking this, but are you insane?
Unfortunately, I’m always surrounded by insane companions!
Oh, you’ve said it now! Fine, let’s do this! I finally understand what you’re thinking, Kazuma! You should’ve just told me at the start!
Seriously, I really love you!
I’ve known that a long time ago! I’ve shown you how cool I can be with that Fenrir, now’s your turn!
Very well, I’ll show you a sight that befits the title of the Bomber Majin!
Wait. It’s close.
…Kazuma, you can see in the dark, right? So why does your hand bump into my chest every time you let me know there’s an enemy?
Even I’m not perfect, so just let it slide this once. Anyway, over there…
Ah, I see. That’s why it’s called ninnin.
Is something the matter with ninnin? But, look at this Kazuma! That shiny luster, that unique form! I really want to take it home after defeating it!
I see, so Fenrir ran from that, huh. Well then, let’s get started! After Kazuma went out of his way to bring me here, I’ll definitely bring it down!
…Say, why don’t we just go back home today and come back tomorrow instead?
(And then, I’ll take the title of Bomber… What did you just say?
Running around made me feel sick. I want to hurry back and go to sleep…
Are you seriously going to stop after coming this far? Just where did all your motivation and bravado disappear off to? Don’t tell me you sobered up!? Of all times, you sobered up now!?
Hey, calm down, our opponent is a big shot that stymies even the Crimson Demon tribe. We should make some proper preparations…
I know it’s dangerous! I warned you so many times! And preparations are something you should’ve done before coming out here! Isn’t it too much to leave me hanging after getting my hopes up so much!?
You say that, but you keep doing the exact same thing! You always get me all worked up only to leave me hanging.
That might be so, I apologize for that. So it was always this tough on you, wasn’t it? I’m sorry.
Now that I get a close look at it, it’s damaged all over. I wonder if it’s from the Explosion a few days ago.
Alright, let’s defeat this thing and go back to sleep. Here’s the plan: You go out alone to face it, chant your magic, and blow it away. That is all.
Isn’t that plan too dull! And what will you be doing…
Blaurgh.
…You’re feeling sick because of all that running around, I see. Just sit there for now. I’ll be counting on you to take me home afterwards!
Well then, I am going. Please watch my cool performance.
My name is Megumin! I am a wielder Explosion Magic, and the strongest mage of Axel!
You might have been once called the guardian of the Crimson Demons, but we can’t have you attacking our tourists. We’ve been letting it slide since you were quietly living in the depths of the forest, but now that you’ve come all the way out here-
Eh? Wai-!
Ka-Kazuma!?
You’re pretty good to be able to break through my Lurk skill! But how unfortunate for you, against a robot, I’m invincible! Steal!
Kazuma, now’s not the time to be messing around! If you want my panties that badly, I’ll wash it and give it to you later!
No, there’s no point if you wash… That’s not it, this guy was just too fast! Dammit, I already used that wire on Fenrir…
That’s it, underwear! Megumin, give me your bra too! If I tie it together with your panties, I can instantly make a substitute rope…
Are you still drunk!? There’s no way that will restrain it! Kazuma, behind you!
Dammit, don’t think that ninjas are the only one who has the night as their domain! Night is also when NEETS are most active! Don’t think that you’re the only one who’s stronger here!
You might have meant for that to be a cool line, but it’s not cool at all! You really did sober up, didn’t you!? It has none of the wit from before!
S-Shut up, just get to chanting already! I demand a do-over! My name is Satou Kazuma! Seeing through the dark and moving through the shadows, I’ve stolen a multitude of treasures. I am the guy that will shake the world!
I thought it was pretty cool for a moment, but that thing in your hands just completely ruins it!
There you are!!
!?
You’re the worst! Agh, just what is it, are you being really cool tonight or not, I just don’t know!
Shut up, I’m being desperate here! If I can use it, I’ll use it!
Whoa!?
Kazuma!? Dealing with ninnin is too difficult after all! It moves too fast that I can’t aim at it, and more importantly, I can’t attack it because it won’t leave your side!
Y-You’re pretty good. I didn’t expect you to actually stand up to me at blaaaargh-
Just give up on the cool speeches already!
Sorry, it’s actually working on me. This is bad… Megumin, I won’t be able to move for a while, so forget about using magic and run back to the village… This guy will let you go, so wake up Aqua and let the other villagers…
There’s no way I’ll run away alone like that! Sorry, but I’m not good at listening to others!
First Aqua and now you, why don’t you guys ever listen! What are you going to do as a mage if you throw away your staff!?
That’s the stance the ninnin uses for its detonation magic. If a weakling like you get caught up in it, there wouldn’t even be a corpse left!
I just heard something that I can’t ignore! Cheat harem? Cheat harem you say!?! The goal of your creator was to wipe out all those cheat-having harem bastards!? If that’s the case, then aiming for me was a mistake, damn you!
I don’t know why you’re suddenly so angry, but please stay still!
Megumin, why is it just standing still? It could easily kill me if it were to just attack.
The Bomber Majin makes it’s opponents explode, that’s why it’s called the Bomber Majin. Whenever it comes across a party full of girls lead by a guy with black hair and eyes, it would scream ‘Go explode!’ and blow them away! That’s why it’s so terrifying.
Isn’t that just plain Riajuu hunting! How ridiculous! Megumin, protect me! I’m going to keep using Steal on it until I get its vital parts!
That’s fine, but you won’t accidentally target me instead, will you!? I’m not wearing panties right now, so there’s nothing left! If you happen to steal my robe, my lower half will be completely nude!
I’ll take responsibility when that happens! Here we go, Steal! Steal! Steal! Steal!
Did I do it?
You’ve really done it this time! Please give me back my bra! If you took just one more thing, it would really have been a disaster!
Dammit, so he can still move… This is bad, my chest and stomach hurts… I wonder if I can carry you back to the village like this…
This village is really something else. I’m not coming back here anymore. Hey Megumin, don’t leave me. If you get too far, that thing is going to blow me up.
You were so cool just a few moments ago, and now you’re using a woman as a shield… Really, just why did I fall in love with such a guy…
You weren’t originally like this. Just what happened to you? Even though you’ve taken some damage from my explosion, your movements were still way too clumsy.
… As a fellow explosion lover, I can’t hate you, but there’s no way I can overlook you setting your sights on my companion…
Confirmed observation of the Maximum Magical Capabilities of the Crimson Demons. With the appearance of a being that have exceeded prior magic power predictions, the Modification project is judged a success. Now sending latest report to Noise Kingdom HQ. HQ, please respond. The project is a success. Please convey these results to the master-
Explosion!
You really gave me a fright! Megumin, you really should stop doing such things!
Shut up, you NEET. That was a celebration for the next chief. If anything, you should be thanking me.
Stop calling me a NEET! I’m not a NEET, I’m a member of the Defence Corps and don’t you forget that! That aside…
Still, I didn’t expect you, her guardian, to get involved in it too… Just when we starting to get along too… It’s really a shame.
Bukkorori-san, I’m sorry. I felt like I was getting along well with you too… To make up for it, I’ll teach you a great way to pass time. It goes like this: you create ice using freeze and watch it as it melts. Before you notice it, a day would have already passed.
That’s a pretty good idea. I have a lot of free time everyday, so I’ll go try this out soon.
Please don’t get too chummy with each other! This is why NEETs are so… Can’t you spend your time doing something more worthwhile?
…I get that you’re upset over the gap between you and your rival now but… No matter how upset you are, you can’t just cast Explosion magic during her celebration.
If you’re going to keep lecturing me, I have to say something as well. Do you remember Soketto, the one you always stalk? I heard that you made her cry by sexually harassing her and calling it punishment.
Just what are you saying? Soketto just seemed to be acting odd recently. The other day, she invited me to get my fortune told, but she made a bunch of inscrutable expressions in front of her crystal ball before chasing me out. Even a few days ago, she ambushed me while I was out on patrol, saying something about she’ll help me practice or the like.
Why, if it isn’t Ms. Next Chief In Line. What is it? Have you come to laugh at me? If you want to laugh at how unsightly am I, then go ahead and laugh!
Ahahahahahahaha! Megumin is in jail! Ahahaha!
You really laughed at me! Fine then, we’ll settle it for real this time! Bukkorori, open the door right now!! If you don’t, I’ll let loose my Explosion right here!
Ha… Seriously, what have you done this time..? Umm, Bukkorori-san… I’ll keep watch on her, so could you let me talk to Megumin privately?
Fine with me. I may not look like it, but I’m actually pretty busy.
I bet you’re just going to stalk Soketto again under the guise of patrolling around.
Oh shut up! You may not think so, but not just any idiot can do the patrolling around here. Plus, the Demon King’s army has been making some strange movements around here recently. Just the other day, a band of red-eyed zombies and golems were seen loitering near the village…
… So what exactly happened last night?
I was upset that you stole a victory over me, so I went out to vent my frustrations.
Hmm…
What with that ‘hmm…’? If you have something to say then just say it.
Not particularly. It’s just, I noticed this after spending all this time with you, but your eyes turn blue whenever you tell a lie. Did you know that? I wonder if it’s a rare Crimson Demon trait.
Wait, really!? This is the first I’ve heard about it! So you’re saying that I’m special even amongst Crimson Demons? Am I the chosen one!?
You’re normally pretty sharp, so try not to get fooled so easily.
Why is Yunyun calling me a fool… You tricked me! You’re trying to make a fool of me again! Kazuma, please look into my eyes!
Hmm? What’s the matter? Well, I don’t mind looking if you ask me to.
Kazuma, did you know that on the bodies of Crimson Demons, you can find strips of lines that people call a barcode? By the way, Yunyun’s is located in a very risque part of her inner thighs. …So how was it? Did my eyes turn blue or are they still red?
What are you suddenly saying! Normally, you would say an obvious lie in such a situation, right!?
It’s red like always. So that means you’re speaking the truth, right?
I feel so much better now. So, what did you come here for? Don’t tell me your true nature as a loner was exposed and everyone left you?
What are you saying! I… I’m still fine… I think… Wait, that’s not it!
Let me see your Adventurer Card.
No way. Why do I have to show my card to my rival? Besides, being a loner has its limits, you know. Just because you’re lonely doesn’t mean you should willingly go with others into a jail cell.
That’s not it! Even I wouldn’t do that! Just show me the exterminated monsters part. You don’t have anything to hide, do you?
I have nothing to hide, but I’m still not showing it to you! It’s not like I hunted the onion ducks that Bukkorori was carefully raising just to get some experience points.
You just said something that I can’t ignore! Hey, did you hunt them!? Bukkorori-san was carefully raising those ducks for Soketto because she was treating him coldly recently. Hey, did you!?
Argh! That doesn’t really matter, just show me your card! Hey, the Bomber Majin was really there, right? And you hunted it together with Kazuma-san, right?
What are you suddenly saying? There’s no way we would hunt something like that. You know it won’t attack Crimson Demons, right? If I wanted to go Ninin hunting, I would have taken another Crimson Demon with me instead.
Even though you keep saying that the explosions are the fault of the Bomber Majin?
The ones causing those explosions everyday was me.
…Did you feel like you lost to me because I was able to complete the three trials of the Crimson Demons and became the next chief in line?
I don’t know what you are talking about. I’m the worst mage of the Crimson Demons, so I wouldn’t be qualified to compete you in the first place. Isn’t this good for you? Everyone in the village will be fawning all over you.
…Megumin, you’re going back to Axel, aren’t you?
But of course. I’m the strongest mage of Axel after all. If I disappear, the citizens of Axel will be troubled.
Weren’t you just saying earlier that you were the worst mage of the Crimson Demons? And now you’re the strongest mage of Axel?
Yunyun, from now on, you’ll be staying in the village to learn how to manage it, right? Then, I guess this is our goodbye.
… Don’t think you’ve won with just this.
… I just don’t get this girl. Aren’t you the one that won?
Since you’re a loner without any party members or a man, I don’t mind letting you have this victory. It’s our last duel, after all.
… Hey, are you going to keep bragging about Kazuma-san to me until I get a boyfriend? Having a boyfriend isn’t that big of a deal, you know!
True. Let’s just call it my loss. I’m going to be building my own little bundle of happiness with this man here, so Yunyun, please continue working to be the strongest mage. The job of the chief seems pretty tough, but take care not to neglect finding a boyfriend.
Isn’t becoming the strongest mage your dream!? And you were the one who called me a pervert and what not every time I brought up the topic of love!
Kazuma, should I give you a lap pillow? It’s the least I could do after making you spend your time here with me. Please use my lap instead of the cold floor of this cell.
Ok, I’ll do that.
Hey, why are you just naturally giving him a lap pillow? You weren’t that close before right!?
What’s the matter, Yunyun whom I lost to? That aside, we’re finally alone together here, so could you not bother us? You already have people who’re fawning over you after becoming a chief, right? Why don’t you spend your time with them instead?
Mmm, it’s really smooth and feels really good. I didn’t work that hard yesterday for nothing.
Hey Megumin, isn’t your face getting red!? You’re not really used to doing these things, right!? You’re just putting up with Kazuma’s sexual harassment, right!?
This much is just normal, right? …Ka-Kazuma, I don’t think your face is suppose to be facing that way… No, I’m not embarrassed. I just thought Kazuma would have a hard time breathing like that.
Issh ohhkay.
Is that so!? Oh, alright, lap pillows can be done like this too!
Megumin, you’re definitely putting up with it, aren’t you!? And Kazuma-san, cut it out already!
Seriously Kazuma! And you too Megumin! Will the two of you die if you don’t cause some kind of trouble!? You really should learn a little more from me and my perfect conduct!
It’s just as Aqua said, Kazuma. It’s already too late for Megumin, but why did you join her too?
Don’t get ahead of yourselves! Stop showing me such smug smiles just because you didn’t happen to cause any trouble this time! Megumin and I were out doing vigorous night exercises while you two were sleeping last night, you know!?
Please pay a little more attention to your phrasing! It’s not what you’re thinking, all we did was run away from the monsters that chased after us in the forest!
Listen up, I really showed my stuff last night. I handled that One Strike bear easily, and I schooled that Fenrir so hard that I took pity on it and let it go. Isn’t that right, Megumin?
…Well, you’re not lying but…
The One-Strike bear aside, isn’t a Fenrir a monster on the same level as a calamity? You’re saying that a monster that fearsome is living in the woods this close to the village?
I see, that’s definitely the work of the Demon King’s Army. A Demon King’s General that can command monsters is planning to throw the world into chaos. That’s definitely it! It’s my goddess’s intuition!
Now that I think about it, don’t you have to say your goodbyes to the other villagers before we go, Megumin? Yunyun’s going to be staying here after sending us back, so it’d difficult to come back here afterwards.
There’s no need to say any goodbyes to those people who called me, the number one genius of the Crimson Demons, stuff like Joke Mage, Worst Mage and Explosion Mage. I’ll triumphantly return after defeating the Demon King and have them prostrate themselves before me.
Explosion Mage fits you just fine though.
Hey Aqua, what did you do with the Tranquility Girl seedling? Before I knew it, it had already disappeared from the pot.
I already planted it, of course.
It’s a little weird coming from me considering I was out in the forest last night too, but were you really able to plant it out in that dangerous forest by yourself?
What are you saying? Of course not. I just planted it in Megumin’s backyard.
What did you do?
Now, now, listen to me. Komekko told me she’ll look after it until it grows up. She’s a sharp kid, so I don’t think she’s going to raise it in a bad way. There aren’t any other kids around here that are the same age as her, so they’ll make good friends!
That girl probably intends to eat it after it grows up.
Just what’s wrong with your family? I’m going to go take it back right now.
Megumin’s just joking around with you. Yunyun is going to come back soon, so just sit still.
…Yeah, of course it’s a joke. Seriously, Megumin! Is messing with me that fun? When we get back to Axel, I’ll reveal to everyone just how much of a siscon you are… Hey Megumin, it was a joke, right? Why are you keeping silent? Why won’t you meet my eyes?
Megumin!
What’s the matter Yunyun? I get that you’re in high spirits because you finally made some friends in the village, but if you’re too eager, they’ll get fed up with you.
That’s not it! Also, tell me those kind of things earlier! Yesterday, and today too… I think I’ve already been too eager!
I’ll go back to Axel with you!
I’m going to try and defeat the Demon King too! I don’t want a victory handed over to me like this… I’ll defeat the Demon King. And once I’ve achieved that, I’ll officially become the chief! I’ve already talked this over with my father and everyone in the village!
You just can’t be honest, can you? Your eyes are bright red, you know?
You just can’t take a hint, can you, Aqua? Fine, let me go pull up that Tranquility Girl you so selfishly planted in my yard!
Come on, Yunyun, if you’re going back to Axel, then hurry up and get ready. Also, I don’t think you’ve noticed this, but the adventurers in that town are surprisingly reliant on you. If you asked them to let you into their party, they’ll probably end up fighting over you.
Really!? Hey, why didn’t you tell me something this important before!?
If you ended up making a lot of friends in that town, you would get attached to that town and give up on becoming the chief, wouldn’t you?
Of course I would!
At least think it over for a while. Seriously. Anyway, let’s hurry up and head back to our town.
I-I get it so don’t rush me! …But, is what you said earlier true? That the adventurers in Axel are, umm, reliant on me…
Surprisingly. I said surprisingly. If you get too carried away, you’ll return to being a loner.
Haa… I was able to win against Megumin and the villagers also accepted me. This all feels like a dream…
What do you mean win against me? Now that you’re going back to Axel, there’s no way I would just give you that victory!
Hey, what are you saying now? I cleared the three trials of the Crimson Demons, so doesn’t that make it my victory this time? You’re just being a sore loser!
If you’re going to take it that far, then let’s have a match, Megumin! I’ll definitely make you admit defeat this time!
Oh look, my card was in a place like this. Weren’t you asking me to show you the exterminated monsters part earlier? Look! The name of the Bomber Majin is right here-
How could you change your stance that quickly!
To think that you actually defeated Moguninnin while I wasn’t there. But we are party mates, so you’ll split the money even if I was sleeping back then, right?
W-Well, I didn’t expect that you really only did vigorous excercises last night. Sorry for doubting you, Megumin, Kazuma. Oh, I know! Aqua, why don’t we buy some high quality ingredients and throw a party for them to celebrate their accomplishments!?
It’s not a problem at all. I actually think it’s a wonderful idea, especially coming from the usually hardheaded Darkness.
So, Megumin, what do you think? Whose portion do you think we should draw the money to buy the high class ingredients from?
Yeah, seriously! After knowing me for so long, you two should know very well that I wouldn’t cause trouble just to fulfill my desire to cast Explosions.
As if.
Kazuma, whose side are you on?
Yo, Onee-san, it’s the large bounty hunter, Satou Kazuma.
Ah, Satou-san! What brings you here today?
I did it again, onee-san. Seriously… If we keep going on at this pace, we’ll wipe out all the large bounty targets in no time at all. This will put all the other adventurers out of business, haha!
H-Hahaha… So you defeated the Bomber Majin Moguninnin, I see. Congratulations, I’ll go prepare the bounty immediately!
Umm… Could you be Satou Kazuma-sama?
I have heard a lot about you… I’ve been awaiting your arrival. My name is Serena… I hope this is not too sudden, but is there any chance you’re willing to let me join your party?
Huh? What are you saying? This party already has an excellent Archpriest, so there’s no need for another priest. Now go away. Shoo, shoo.
Satou Kazuma-sama, would you please consider allowing me to become one of your retainers? I swear that I will not become a burden upon you.
You must be some underling of the Demon King, right? You want to join my party? There is no one in their right mind who would want to join my party after learning of my infamy. Yup, your true identity is an assassin sent by the Demon King who judged me as a threat after taking out so many of his Generals-
Sacred Highness Heal!!
… Hey, why did you just cast a recovery spell on me?
You who has low stats, low levels and the weakest class seem to be under the delusion that the Demon King has placed a mark upon you, so I casted heal on your mind.
To think they would doubt you so… Kazuma-sama, I believe that evaluation to be far below your actual skills. As a great adventurer who has defeated so many tough enemies and acquired vast amounts of wealth at a young age, you might very well be the hero chosen by the goddess to defeat the Demon King…
Sacred Highness Heal!!
… Why did you cast recovery magic on me?
You were calling our Kazuma a hero or whatever, so I thought to cast heal on your brain.
Ahem. Anyway, I’m really loathe to say this, but she’s technically our party’s priest. Sorry, but we are not currently looking for additional party members right now. Could you please look elsewhere?
Ouch! Ouch! It hurts! Kazuma-san, it really hurts!
… I suppose that can’t be helped. I’ll excuse myself here. However, Kazuma-sama. If you allow me to join your party, I’m certain I’ll be of great help to you.
… Why are you fidgeting?
Seeing Kazuma get led away by a beautiful priest who appeared out of nowhere… I thought this must be what NTR feels like…
… Say, can I go chase after her?
Now then, everyone who’s going out for the extermination quests, please line up here. I’ll be casting long duration support magic on you…
Oh, Kazuma-sama. How about it, would you like to have me cast support magic on you too? Support spells cast by different sects will stack. I believe I’m of a different sect from your priest, so our spells should stack with each other.
Hey, you’re going to cause problems for the other priests if you do that without consulting us. The goodwill towards us is already quite thin, so stop doing such things.
It’s better to refrain from that sort of behaviour. Otherwise, Kazuma-sama’s reputation will be dragged through the mud. Is it because of you that Kazuma-sama has such a bad reputation? …Plus, is it wrong to offer a helping hand to parties without priests?
It is not wrong.
I won’t ask you to cast support magic free of charge to everyone. Even though you’re a far stronger priest than I am, I won’t reproach you for not supporting the other adventurers in the past… However, my actions do not bring inconvenience upon anyone. This is the proper thing to do. I do not believe that you have the right to put a stop to that.
…Yes.
… I admit defeat…
… I don’t like this.
I don’t like this… I’ve never seen such a priest-like priest before… The others might have fallen for your wiles with a simple support spell, but you can’t fool me that easily. As far as abilities go, Aqua onee-san who revived me before should have the upper hand. I stand on her side… I don’t like this. I don’t like this at all…
All adventurers, I hope you’ll work hard on the extermination quests today! Now then, today’s situation is somewhat different…
The truth is, last night, a large outbreak of undead appeared near the public cemetery, so we would like you all to focus on exterminating them today. It’s fairly close to the town, so there’s no telling when the citizens will be threatened. In particular, we request all priests to please take part in this extermination.
What? Why is everyone looking at me like that!? I properly purify the graveyard every week! I didn’t slack off this time!
… Didn’t you slack off before?…
Hey, don’t look at me like that! I properly did my work this time! It’s not a lie! Fine, just you wait! I’ll show you what an Archpriest can really do! Just me alone is enough to deal with Zombies and Skeletons!
What the hell is this!?
… S-Say… Can I go home?
Y-You can’t, Kazuma. I too really want to go home in the face of this stench, but I need to show off my cool side here. Afterwards, everyone will once again think that, yeah, the beautiful priest of Axel really is Aqua-sama after all.
Oh well, go get them, Aqua. If you charge right into them, the undead will all gather around you. Just get them all with a large area purification spell.
Eh!? I really don’t want to be surrounded by an undead horde this large…
Then, leave this to me…
Right, Darkness, continue to hold Megumin down. We can’t have her blow away the entire cemetery with them. Now, Aqua, let’s go!
Hey- Darkness, please let go of me! It would feel really amazing to fire an Explosion right into that horde! At this rate, Aqua would just purify them all! My Explosion will properly take care of them!
You’ll properly take care of the entire cemetery too! As a Crusader, there’s no way I’ll just stand by and let you destroy the cemetery!
… Huh?
… They aren’t coming towards me at all.
What, could it be that your slim glimmer of divinity has finally gone out?
Do you want me to deliver divine punishment upon you, you shitty NEET!? You’ll definitely fall to hell after you die!
If I fall to hell, I’ll just have a party with Vanir and the others.
Why do you have such a disgustingly large network!? How vexing!
Turn undead!
Huh?
HAAAAAH!? Aqua, isn’t dealing with undead is your only strong point!? D-Do something about this!
This is strange! This is really strange! Huh? These guys might not be undead after all! I’ve never seen red-eyed zombies before! And, wait, Kazuma, why are you distancing yourself from me!? Aren’t we party members? Aren’t we friends!?
Turn Undead!
Ooooh!
Oh, my, you’re really amazing. Would you like to join our party? We do have an advanced class amongst us. Just the one, though.
No, no, join my party! Our party has quite a few accomplishments, you know!?
Please join our party! Our party is all female, so you can put your mind at ease!
… No, um… I have my sights set on joining Kazuma-sama’s party, so…
Now, now, I’ll throw this pinecone into that cup on the table. Then, from the cup…
You know, I don’t think your tricks would really work right now.
… From the cup… high quality matsutake mushrooms will… shoot up … 
… one after another… They’ll grow from the cup…
… Hey, how did you do that? Having freshly grown matsutake mushrooms growing in this season is really odd. And there’s even a second and third shoot…
ーStill, is this really okay, Serena-san? This extermination was pretty much handled entirely by you alone, so giving up all of the rewards to spread amongst ourselves…
I’m clergy. As long as I have enough to pay for food and shelter, that’s more than enough.
… Hey, you’re losing, you know? Is that really okay?
…… Leave me alone. I’m the goddess of a minor cult. It’s fine if I can’t become a major goddess, I’ll just look over those who worship me fervently. That delinquent Dust said it earlier, didn’t he? That’ll he is on my side? There might not be many of them, but there are people who’re supporting me. That’s why I don’t feel like I lost…
I thought you were different from the moment I laid eyes on you! Unlike a certain disappointing Archpriest, you truly are a wonderful person! Especially how you don’t lust after money!
… He’s saying that sort of things, you know?
… Say, Kazuma-san… Kazuma-san, you’ll always be on my side, right?
Serena-san, I got a couple of scrapes while out on a subjugation quest. Could you heal it?
Sure, that’s not a problem. Could you show me the wound?
Serena-san, please do me next!
Serena-san is like a real goddess!
This is so vexing…
Aqua-san, it’s quite troubling for you to keep coming over here…
… Aqua, you’re in the way over there, and I’m pretty sure everyone’s already noticed you, so come on out already.
… How dare that woman steal away my popularity. It should’ve been me who is getting fawned over by the adventurers as the goddess of healing.
You know, you’re not going to find a weakness to exploit no matter how long you spend stalking her, so let’s just go home and sleep.
I’m not going to dignify that.
Hey, Kazuma, I have something to ask of you.
Could you prick my finger with your dagger? I’m going to go get treated by her.
…You can heal it yourself, can’t you? What, you going to go pick a fight? You really shouldn’t. At the end of the day, she’s very highly regarded amongst the adventurers right now. If you do anything untoward to her, you’ll be making an enemy out of the entire guild.
… Hey, you were the one who came up with this, so stop moving your finger.
It’s still scary. It’s might not be much, but it’s still my own blood. Make sure you just prick it a little. Just a little.
Oh, my finger has disappeared~! Which one are you supposed to stab, I wonder?
…! …!
There, now get going.
Sorry. As you can see, I’m heavily injured… Could you let a weak and injured young girl go first?
No, wait, you can heal your wounds by… Okay, I get it. I get it, so stop threatening me with those weird movements!
Please wait a moment.
I don’t know why you won’t just heal your wounds yourself, but… But aren’t you a priest? Healing the wounds of others is supposed to be your job, so what are you trying to do by pushing someone else aside so you could be healed first? Don’t you think that’s not something a priest should do?
…I do…
I’m not saying that I won’t heal you just because you are a priest, but everyone else is suffering too. So, please properly follow the line, okay?
Yes. I’m sorry.
Sensei, a passing shitty NEET dealt a serious wound on me. Can you heal it? Or am I going to die from this wound?
It’s just a small scratch. I’ll heal it right away… Heal!… There, now it’s fine…
…!?
Sensei, am I really going to die? Is it a wound that even you can’t heal? Or are you not healing me because you dislike me? Just what is happening, Sensei!?
Heal! Heal! What’s going on? It isn’t taking effect…
Sensei, why aren’t you healing me? Don’t tell me, you’re not healing me because you’re afraid that I might usurp your popularity and reputation as the number one priest in this guild!? Or can you not heal me because you suck? Aaa…! I’m going to die at this rate! The wound will get infected and I’ll die…! Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san! This woman won’t heal me!
If I die, please build me a grave that suppasses even the pyramids in the center of town. Please put all of the treasures in my room that Kazuma has been treating like trash within it. Emperor Zell will be its guardian, and prepare delicious drinks and snacks three times a day in front of it. On the gravestone, write here lies the great-
I’ll write here lies a great idiot. Sorry, Serena-san. Come on, let’s go.
…! …!
Um… Kazuma-sama, there’s something important I’d like to tell you, so may I have a moment of your time?
Hey, give it a rest already! You’re being very persistent to our Kazuma-san! Just stealing the position of the number one beautiful priest in the guild isn’t enough for you, now you want to take away Kazuma-san with your erotic charms too!? Our Kazuma-san is a weak-willed man who’ll easily fall if a girl younger than him were to call him onii-chan, so would you please stop that?
Right, get over here, I’ll teach you a lesson.
The number one beautiful priest in the guild…
Who was the one who laughed just now? I can hear you from over here, so come on out! Ah, weren’t you the one I revived some time ago!? If you’re going to laugh, then pay up! Resurrection is originally a super high level spell that demands a large remuneration, so pay up!
Hey, it wasn’t me! I didn’t laugh… Hey, don’t put your finger into my beer, Aqua-san… Wait, this is just water! Why did you use my beer for a trick!?
It’s not a trick, it’s a property of my body! Fine, I understand you all now! Even after all the support magic and healing and resurrections I provided when you guys were hunting those strong monsters and high bounty targets! Fine, as payment, I’ll turn all the beer in this place into water!
Please stop, Aqua-san. If you do that, the guild will be the one most troubled! Please, stop!
Should we go somewhere else, Kazuma-sama? It’s a little too noisy here. If possible, I would prefer a less crowded place…
What I’m about to tell you isn’t something we should be talking about within a store…
People don’t often pass through here, and we can easily change topics even if someone stumbles upon us. So, shall we have a little chat?
ーーAnd eventually, that person was consumed by evil forces… I don’t know when it started, but eventually, the people of the world ended up referring to her by a single name… The Demon King. The Demon King isn’t hurting the inhabitants of this world by her own will…
How could this be… To think that that sort of manga-like development would actually happen…
…Manga?… Anyway, because of that, that young girl ended up becoming the Demon King. Her form has been twisted to a truly hideous form by that curse, but it will soon be broken… Please, Kazuma-sama, as the one chosen by the goddess, I’m sure you’re itching to rid the world of the Demon King who has brought so much suffering to mankind. But the Demon King used to be a helpless young girl too! Could you please delay your plans of defeating the Demon King? If you really can’t… If you are truly dead set on defeating the Demon King, then please, allow me join your party and bring me to her…
Still, Serena-san, why do you think I’m the one chosen by the goddess? To be frank, taking down all those Generals and high bounty targets is more of a fluke than anything else.
I knew there was something different about you the moment I heard your name, Kazuma-sama. I do not know if you are aware of this, but every so often, beings with special powers will appear in this world. Those powers take the form of skills, of physical attributes, of strange magics and weapons. There’s a large variety of them, but one thing they all have in common is that they all strike fear to those of the Demon King.
Err, well, I do kind of know of them… Anyway, you think I’m one of those guys because of my strange name, right? Well, sorry to say this, but I don’t really have any special-
No, it’s not because you have a strange name!
It’s true, those who possess such special powers tend to have strange names. But that’s not what convinced me that you are special. There was once a legendary swordsman who brought much destruction to the Demon King’s forces! The moment I heard your name, I was certain of it! You are his descendant!
… Why do you think so?
That person’s name was Satou. Could it really be mere coincidence for someone else to have such a rare name? I do not believe so!
Serena-san, I’m sorry to say this, but it’s the unmistakable truth that I’m an adventurer with the weakest job. The story you just told me was really exciting and all, but, well, it’s impossible for me to defeat the Demon King. I don’t intend to face him in the first place, and even if I did, I don’t have the ability to. Plus, from what you’ve told me, the curse is going to wear off soon, and the Demon King is just a young girl, right? No, no, that’s totally impossible. I don’t have the resolve needed to kill a person. Just dealing with humanoid monsters is tough enough as is.
You shouldn’t be that humble… Still… I see. Fufu, Kazuma-sama is a really kind person, aren’t you?
Now then, I shall…
Celestina-san! Is that Celestina-san!?
Ah, Kazuma-san too! What are you two doing in such a place? You really have some kind of fate with the Demon King’s Generals. First me and Vanir, and now Celestina-san too! Did you already make friends with her?
… Have you mistaken me for someone else? I’m a priest named Serena. I’m sure you’ve got the wrong person-
Celestina-san, you really should visit my store now that you’re here. Kazuma-san, you’re welcome too. I’ll put on some tea.
Kazuma-sama, do you know her? Could you explain to her that she’s got the wrong person?
Why won’t you look at me, Celestina-san? And what’s with that posh way of speaking? You didn’t forget about me, did you? It’s me, Wiz! I lived with you in Demon King-san’s castle way back when! Celestina-san!
Would you j-Could you please stop that? I am Serena.  That Celes-whatever is a different person, so could you give it a rest?
What are you saying? However you look at it, you’re Celestina-san! You’re the Dark Priest Celestina-san! The only human in the Demon King’s army who’s great at scheming and infiltrating-
You seem to have split ends. Let me take care of it. Heal! Heal!
Ow! Ow! What are you doing, Celestina-san! What is up with you!? Fine, I don’t know you anymore! I thought I’d show you that interesting magic item I just got my hands on… Kazuma-san, do drop by my store soon.
… What a strange person. Smokes comes out of her when she gets healed.
Well, she is a Lich after all. Though I’m sure you already know that, Celestina-san.
That’s not it!
Oh?
It’s true, I’m one of the Demon King’s Generals, Celestina. But please hear me out, the story I told you earlier is the truth! I’m actually the Demon King’s older sister. In order to save my sister, I had no choice but to join the Demon King’s Army! Ah, when I think about her…
What’s this about a sister? Boy who’s worried if he’s actually under a curse that causes something to interfere whenever things start going well. That disappointing storekeeper who merrily bought some trash again told me you were nearby. Moi might be willing to help you with that for a fair price. How about paying the shop a visit?
…Good afternoon. Nice to meet you. Are you a friend of Kazuma-sama? Um, Kazuma-sama, you seem to be quite busy, so I shall take my…
Nice to meet you for the first time, pure and upright priest who’s not the slightest bit suspicious. Now, now, there’s no need to rush home. As proof of our meeting, and on behalf of the charred and melting shopkeeper, moi shall offer one of the items that shopkeeper so gleefully bought a short while ago for a low price.
This is today’s recommended item! The best friend of traveling adventurers, the Bug Killerin! Don’t be fooled by its cute name, this is very powerful indeed. It’s a magic item that bestows a powerful death curse upon any creature smaller than a mouse that approaches it. In other words, if you put this under your pillow, you will be able to sleep without worrying about being stung by any annoying insects.
Oh?
There’s got to be some kind of downside, isn’t there? Like putting that death curse upon humans with a low chance of success or the like?
Not at all. It will not have any effect on any creatures larger than a mouse. The only things that will die are creatures smaller than rats.
What a wonderful item. In other words, if I put that under my pillow, even the swift and glossy black fearsome emperor will die if it gets close. Please give me one…
Thank you for your business!
… Say, Vanir, any living thing smaller than a rat that gets close will die, right?
Of course.
… Then, the bacteria living in human’s guts and symbiotes and whatever else will die too?
Of course.
Hold on, newly introduced person. Moi treats the personal information of my customers with the utmost respect, but should you return that item, you shall cease to be a customer of mine. Hmm, yes, I see something… The future of someone who will get mauled by the adventurers after a certain masked gentleman reveals all sorts of secret…
I’ll buy it! I’ll buy it! How much is it!?
Fuhahahaha! Moi is in a very good mood today! After all, the pieces of trash that the defective shopkeeper bought actually was turned into money! Originally, this item goes for 400,000 Eris, but considering it’s our first meeting, and moi’s good mood, moi shall let you have it for 1,200,800 Eris!
The price went up you piece of shit! Why do you know exactly how much money I have! Don’t use your all-seeing sight on everything!
Fuhahahaha! Till we meet again, brat! Oh, and, person whom I just met, your dark emotions are delicious indeed! Most delicious indeed! Fuhahahaha!
…My money…
You know, I’ve had this on my mind for some time now, but maybe monsters aren’t born ferocious. They simply have no choice but to become ferocious to survive in this harsh world.
Yeah… We’re taught that monsters are enemies of humanity that must be eradicated, but looking at her, it’s really hard to believe that…
Well said, you two. Just look at that innocent smile. My all seeing eyes do declare that she’s definitely a pure girl.
… Hearing your assurances just makes her seem more suspicious.
Aqua-san, I’ve decided. I’ll take care of this girl. No, I’ll adopt this girl as my own. She’ll become the next chief after me.
Are you even listening to yourself? I’m making fertilizer for her out of today’s leftovers, so lend me a hand.
Me too! I’ll go make some more clean water!
… To think I’d end up taking care of a Tranquility Girl… We’ll be planting you in the depths of the forests near the village, so take care. You won’t be able to get nourishment from humans, but I’m sure you’ll manage somehow…
Like heck I will.
What did you just say?
… You said something really bad just now, right? Hey, say something.
Tsk.
Hey, Kazuma, I heard this from the villagers. Apparently the northeastern part of the forest sees the least human activity, so… W-What are you doing!?
Let go, Darkness! I’m going uproot this thing and burn it!
What are you saying!? Aqua will cry!
Listen to me, Darkness. This girl really is evil from the moment it’s sown. She said some really dangerous words and even knows how to click her tongue.
… Kazuma, I know you’re still guarded against the Tranquility Girl, but think about it. It has barely been two weeks since this girl sprouted. Even a human baby wouldn’t be able to speak yet, and in any case it’s way too early for her to be learning words.
But I heard it! It definitely said ‘Like heck I will.’ and clicked her tongue on top of that!
What’s all this fuss about? What’s that about clicking your tongue?
I wonder what we should name her… Her skin is white, so how about… Shiro-chan?
Hey, Megumin, listen to this! That seedling spoke and even clicked her tongue!
Um… Kazuma-san, from a biological standpoint, a creature this small wouldn’t have developed the proper brain structure to memorize words…
What are you saying in a world where vegetables jump and fly around? Hey, why don’t you say something again!?
She’s a girl who’s received pure holy water, you know? Seriously, Kazuma-san, what are you doing? No matter how cute she is, pulling this sort of prank is a little…
Don’t get the wrong idea! This girl spoke and clicked her tongue! Why won’t any of you believe me!?
Kazuma… You must be tired from waking up early after getting used to sleeping in. It’s fine, just take a rest until evening.
Don’t you gave me that look too! Dammit, it’s all because of you that everyone is treating me like I’m crazy!
What is going on, Nii-chan?
Oh, Komekko… No, it’s just, this seedling has a bad attitude, but no one believes me.
… Looks tasty.
Eep!
ーーRight , come play with onii-chan.
I got it. Nee-chan told me to play with nii-chan too.
Hey, Komekko, between me and Megumin, who do you like the most? I’ll give you this snack if you-
I like nii-chan more than nee-chan.
A-Ah, nevermind. Repeat what you just told me to Megumin when she comes back later, and I’ll give you another snack.
Okay!
Now, then, what shall we play? House? Tag?
Devil summoning.
Yeah, let’s leave that till you’re older, okay? Komekko is a Crimson Demon, so it’d be a real headache if you actually end up calling a real devil.
Okay. I got scolded by a small goblin when I summoned him without an offering.
Megumin! Megumin! Come over here, quick!
ーーSeriously, what’s the matter? I told you to keep Komekko company while I was handling housework, didn’t I?
Now’s not the time to be doing that. Your sister did something really amazing. Hey, Komekko, tell Megumin what you just told me.
I like nii-chan more than nee-chan.
What are you saying!? Komekko, I’ll apologize if I did anything bad! It really hurts, so please cut it out!
I said it, so give me another snack.
Kazuma, I’d like to have a word with you, so please come with me.
That’s not it! I mean, I did tell her to say that to you in return for a snack, but that’s not why I called you here. Your sister has summoned a devil!
That’s something that every Crimson Demon does at some point. I used to perform the ritual to summon the God of Destruction when I was a kid.
Don’t say that with such a nostalgic expression! … Wait, what!? So, you’re saying it’s fine!? But Komekko was saying something about a small goblin…
Summoning devils requires an extremely difficult and delicate ritual. On top of that, even if one has the talent to be a devil summoner, it would take at least a decade of hard work to summon even an imp, the weakest type of devil.
Seriously?
Plus, even if the ritual does succeed, a goblin isn’t a devil, so there’s no way it’d be summoned. Komekko, you shouldn’t tease him too much, okay?
Okay.
Right then, I’ll get back to the housework. Please play with each other, alright?
See, your sister got angry because you said such things. It’s a little hypocritical coming from me, but lying is bad, okay?
I didn’t lie.
But Megumin just said it, didn’t she? You can’t summon a goblin with a summoning ritual.
But it came out. I gave it the shell of a cicada as an offering, but it just scolded me. ‘Don’t call upon me without a proper offering. I’ll let you off this time, so don’t do it again.’ it said.
Say, can you describe that goblin to me?
It was really small and black, and had claws, wings, and a tail.
Megumin! Come over here, quick!
… What are you doing?
Ah, Kazuma, what a coincidence. I ran into a beautiful onee-san a while ago who said ‘Considering you’re friends of Megumin, allow me to offer you a little warning. Wind… Darkness… And a divine light… please remember these words.’ before disappearing right in front of me. I don’t get what she said at all, so I’ve been keeping guard here to prevent her from escaping.
Sacred Break Spell!
!?
See, you heard that, right? That surprised noise when I pretended to cast my magic?
I-I kinda feel sorry for her, so cut that out…
I just took my eyes off you two for a moment and you’re causing trouble again…
Umm, don’t bully my clansmen too much.
Hey, Darkness, there should be a pretty onee-san hiding around there, so please search and catch her for me. I want to ask her what she meant earlier.
Don’t worry, I’ll do that for you-
Darkness, please keep a firm grasp on that man. Aqua, it’s a common tradition to tell tourists some mysterious phrases before disappearing. There’s no particular deeper meaning, so please let her go.
By the way, what are the two of you doing? Taking a walk?
No, we are… Rather than explaining, it’d be easier to just show you.
Yo, the one with azure lightning behind her! Good morning. So you’ve come back from Axel?
Roaring Thunder Yunyun! Good morning. How’s the outside world? Has it changed much?
A-Ah, good morning! Good morning! It doesn’t seem to have changed very much!
Kazuma, what are your thoughts after seeing that?
It feels like Yunyun is being bullied.
No, seriously, please look at Yunyun being surrounded by everyone.
Oh, Yunyun, that azure lightning is glowing brightly behind you today too!
Roaring Thunder Yunyun, have you put on some weight lately? It feels like you’ve gained a bit of flesh…
Please stop calling me by that name! And I didn’t get fat, I just grew up!
So, what do you think after seeing her with that smug looking frown while everyone fawns over her and calls her by her title!?
I-Is that so? She doesn’t seem to be enjoying it to me…
Yunyun, you sure seem elated to have everyone address you with such a cool title.
What are you saying!? Do I look happy right now!? Are your eyes made out of glass!?
They are the same red ones that you have!
… Ah, I see, that’s how it is. Megumin sure can’t be honest. Despite what she says, she still headed out there to help Yunyun when she’s suffering under those embarrassing nicknames…
Megumin, you had a title back in Axel too!
I couldn’t care less for an embarrassing title like that! One with azure lightning behind her back, exchange nicknames with me!
Do you really believe that?
… Maybe not…
I don’t like my current title, but the title that you have is…
Fine, I’ll challenge you! If I win, I’ll be taking your title for my own!
Sorry, I don’t want your title, so I’ll pass on this challenge…
W-What!? Yet you were the one who keeps badgering me to accept your challenges!
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, pass the soy sauce.
Here.
Hey, you just touched the soy sauce, didn’t you?
No I didn’t.
Then go ahead and spread it on your meal. It isn’t water, so it won’t ruin the taste, right?
… Say, Kazuma, why are you being so harsh? We’ve been together for quite some time, haven’t we? So you must know what is going on, right?
You keep saying that you didn’t purify the seasonings every time it happens, right? So go ahead. Pour some soy sauce on this fish and dig in.
Oh, fine, I’ll do it! What’s the big deal, I just changed a little of the soy sauce to water! Thinning the sauce a little will surely make it more delicious!
… Do you have anything to say?
… I’ll go buy more soy sauce later, so please pass me the salt…
Ah! What are you doing!? That’s mine! Give it back, you beast!
… This thing really looks down on me. Move aside, Kazuma. It’s about time someone taught this evil black furball about the hierarchy in this house.
Oh come on, it’s just breakfast. Can’t you just enjoy your meal quietly…?
Ow! This horrible demonic beast! It actually dares to scar the flawless skin of a goddess! Fine, if that’s how you want to do… Hot!
Kazuma! Kazuma! This demonic beast just breathed fire!
Hey, cut it out! Don’t shake me while I’m drinking soup! Besides, didn’t I already say it in the past? That cat can breath fire and uses it to cook her fish.
I knew it. I always knew this thing wasn’t an ordinary cat from the moment I saw it, but… Oh, I see it! I see it now! I see its true form!
Your true form is… Yes, a really devil-like form! Hey, let me sniff you! Don’t think you can mask the scent of devils from a goddess!
I don’t have full confidence in her identity either, so go figure that out by yourself.
… Well, it doesn’t really reek like a devil… Why does a cat have the smell of soap on it? Come on, I’ll give that fish to you, so tell me your true identity. I’ll keep it a secret.
Hey, if you mess with her too much while she’s eating, she’ll get angry—
Waaaah! Stop! Stop! I get it! I get it! I won’t pester you about your identity, so don’t scratch up my precious hagoromo!
… It’s so peaceful…
What do you mean by peaceful, you shitty NEET! I’ll give you some of my side dishes during dinner, so hurry up and stop this thing!
Tobacco. I’m talking about tobacco. Someone with such a bad reputation as you must have some of that on hand, right? Come on, give me some. I haven’t had the chance to smoke ever since I came to this town.
N-No, I don’t have any.
I guess there’s no point in trying to keep the act up… I’m Celestina, the Demon King’s General in charge of schemes and infiltration, and a Dark Priest that follows the Dark Goddess of Puppetry and Vengeance, Regina.
So you actually call your own goddess a Dark Goddess. I would’ve thought those of the cloth would treat their own god as absolute and decry all the others as heretics.
My goddess is the patron of vengeance and puppets, you know? What else can she be other than a Dark Goddess?
… Puppetry. Don’t tell me, the zombies at that graveyard that were immune to Turn Undead were…
Oh, yes, that was all me. Those weren’t zombies, they were simply corpses animated by the power of the Dark Goddess. It was really hard to set all of that up. I had to dig up all the corpses one by one in the middle of the night and put them under my control. When the priests in town found themselves helpless, I would come in and handily take care of all of them… It’s a good technique to use to gain the trust of all the adventurers in a city in one fell swoop.
… Then, all those things you said earlier about the Demon King being a girl and the curse and whatnot is…
Huh? What, you actually believed that? I tell that story to every skilled adventurer that seems like they’d be a threat to the Demon King. The curse afflicting the girl will eventually wear off and the Demon King will disappear, so peace will return to the world even if they don’t risk their lives fighting the Demon King. Most of them give up after hearing such a story. Everyone values their own hide, after all. If you give them an excuse that makes risking their lives unnecessary, they’ll happily take it and be on their way.
But, why are you telling all of that to me? Sure, your identity was revealed thanks to Wiz and Vanir, but showing your entire hand like this is a little…
I just thought that rather than pile on more lies and put us both on guard, it’d be better to tell you the truth and come to an arrangement… I’ve been observing your conduct and actions these past few days, but I still have absolutely no idea why the Demon King considers you a threat… I’m just going to lay it out plainly, you’re a NEET who dislikes hard work.
Yep, that’s me.
You have no intentions of risking your life to defeat the Demon King for the sake of humanity, right?
Not at all.
… If you hear that someone you never knew living at someplace you’ve never been has been suffering under the Demon King, what would you think?
I’d send them my condolences…
… Umm, I’m pretty sure most people would give similar responses, so can you please stop looking at me like that?
Eh? A-Aaah, sorry. There have been people who’ve given me similar replies, but this is the first time someone has answered instantly without even the slightest hint of hesitation, so…
… I was ordered by the Demon King to investigate this town where several Demon King’s Generals went missing, and the man whose name kept cropping up in relation to them, but… At the end of it all, the man who’s at the center of everything is you. Leaving that aside…
Wait, hold on a minute, being described as the man at the center of it all doesn’t sit well with me. If anything, I’m the one who’s constantly getting caught up in such matters.
Indeed. Leaving that aside, I’ve gotten a firm understanding of your personality.
Satou Kazuma, the Demon King’s Army would like to offer you a deal.
Oh?
Thanks to a certain person, the war between the Demon King and humanity that’s been at a stalemate for quite some time has started shifting again. After losing so many Generals, the barrier around the Demon King’s castle is on the verge of collapsing.
Oh ho? Could that certain person be referring to me?
… Yes, it is referring to you. Why do you seem so smug? Don’t get ahead of yourself.
I see, so it seems like the Demon King is in quite a pinch right now. If the barrier were to fall, the famously combative Crimson Demons will launch constant teleport raids on the castle.
True, we aren’t in a very good position right now, but that’s the same for humanity, no?
In the past, strong people with strange names and a disregard for common sense would constantly appear in this world. Those people caused us a lot of pain. However… I think it was around the time our fortune teller detected a strange presence in this town? Well, for whatever reason, those hero candidates have completely stopped showing up.
… What’s wrong? It feels like you’ve come to some sort of realization… Why are you all shaken up? … Well, whatever. Anyway, we would like to strike a deal with you.
W-What kind of deal?
Your voice is cracking, you know? Seriously, what’s wrong?
You should join the Demon King’s Army.
… … … … Huh?
Don’t give me that. I’m asking you to join the Demon King’s Army… You are our kind of people. I know that very well.
Don’t misunderstand me. Sure, as you’ve most likely already known, people in general call me a brute and scum and NEET and lolicon and such, but—
This is the first time I’m hearing about the lolicon bit.
True, as a human I might have more bad qualities than good ones… Indeed, I have more than enough money for my needs, any indecent desires I have can be satisfied throughthatshop, and I have affectionate companions that fawn all over me. I would like to be pampered while living an easy life. One where I occasionally splurge on useless expensive things and occasionally book out the tavern for a whole day and trouble everyone…
You’re even worse of a human than I thought…
But even I have a small amount of compassion and a sense of justice. I don’t care if someone I don’t know is suffering in a place I’ve never been to, but I’m not so scummy that I’d ignore someone asking for aid right in front of me. … I understand why you might want my power on your side. I understand, but I have no intention of turning upon the people who’ve taken care of me all this while.
… No, it’s not like we want you because of your strength…
What, aren’t you afraid of my full power and would rather have me as your friend instead?
Not at all. The truth is I’d rather keep you as far away from me as possible, but, like I’ve said earlier, those people with strange names have stopped appearing.
There’s a persistent rumour about these people with funny names. That they are chosen by the gods or some such.
But then, those people who were constantly popping up like weeds suddenly stopped appearing after you showed up. It’s almost as if the gods are saying that you alone would be enough. Even the Demon King thought that you might be the descendant of some legendary hero or the other that shows up in the fairy tales.
I don’t have the strength or force of will to survive in a place surrounded by monsters like the Demon King’s castle. Please tell Demon King-san that I’m not that amazing of a person. Getting involved in the vanquishing of your Generals is just a stroke of luck. I just happen to have really amazing luck. Apart from that, I’m a weakling with the weakest job, Adventurer. Having you treat me like an enemy really scares me, so please stop. Please relay that to him.
… Yeah, I thought so. I’ve confirmed that after seeing you in person. The only person who wanted you to join us is the Demon King, and I do think that he’s worrying too much… But is this okay? There’d be quite a few benefits for you if you were to join us… Ah, yes, you’re a virgin, no? If you join us, you’ll be able to indulge in all your wildest sexual desires. Incidentally, most female demons have really hot bodies.
… … … … I-I’m not going. If it was me from a few months ago, I probably would’ve been convinced, but right now, I’m in my popular period. Such cheap benefits wouldn’t sway me.
Why are you so restless?
… Well, it’s fine. I’ll tell the Demon King that you’re a small fry too insignificant to bother with. He’ll probably stop keeping his eye on you after that. I’ll also arrange for him to tell his underlings not to lay a hand on you.
Thank you very much!
S-Sure… In return, keep my identity a secret, even to your companions. Don’t interfere with my business in this town. And, as for my two colleagues… Don’t tell them about what I’ve been up to. Especially Wiz. … Those are the conditions of my deal.
… Tsk, I don’t have a choice. My conscience and sense of justice are yelling at me to punch you, but the town would be in big trouble if we clashed against each other directly…
Yeah, yeah, you can drop that now. So I take it we have a deal? It’s good that you’re a sensible person.
… Ah, sorry, but… Can you lend me some money?
You owe me one.
… Gurk…
Still, even if she’s a Demon King’s General…
I’m home!
Waaaaaah! Waaaaaah!
There, there, please stop crying. Kazuma should be coming back… Ah, Kazuma, welcome back. You came in at just the right time.
Hey, don’t pretend you didn’t see this! This is a really serious matter!
… So what happened this time?
… Apparently, she caused some kind of ruckus in the guild and was thrown out by the adventurers… I don’t know exactly what she did, but it seems like Aqua is barred from entering the guild for a while.
Megumin and I came back to the mansion after investigating that woman and found her crying with an invoice in her hand.
Are you investigating Serena? Is that why you two have been spending all your time out lately?
Exactly! Listen to this, Kazuma, something’s really odd about that woman! Someone skilled enough to take out an undead horde that large should be a fairly famous priest, but when I went all over searching for more info… there isn’t even a single rumour in any of the cities I contacted about a priest named Serena!
… On top of that, according to the guild staff, that woman has never once claimed a reward from the guild. No matter how saintly of a priest she is, this is way too absurd. You need to present your adventurer’s card in order to claim a reward… So we were thinking that perhaps there is a reason why she can’t show others her card.
If only you could demonstrate such competence every day… That being said, don’t look any further into her. We’ve reached an agreement. Serena will no longer approach us or badger me to let her into the party.
It’s a really fresh feeling for just the two of us to be out together. Still, what business do you have at the guild? Are we going to get lunch at the tavern?
… Why are you dressed like that?
… What are you saying? You were the one who invited me. Everyone in this town already knows about my identity, so there’s no need to go out of my way to hide it.
… Well, I guess it’s fine.
Not many people have heard the name of the Goddess Regina, but her power is the real thing. Any number of your wishes may be granted with her power.
Is that true!? Will she allow me to get a boyfriend!? I don’t have much choice but to sleep in the stables, but whenever I confess to a man that isn’t an adventurer, they would say ’The smell of horse dung is a little… ’ and reject me!
That can be accomplished. Bring me the hair of the man in your heart. With the aid of Regina-sama, I will make a charm that helps him return your feelings.
Serena-san! Me too! Please make one of those charms for me too!
Hey, don’t cut in line! I was here first!
Come, no problem is too small or worry too insignificant. I shall hear you out. That is the duty of a priest, after all…
… U-Um…! I have trouble making friends in this town…! I came back to this town with my best friend, but she has been quite busy lately… A f-friend…! I want a friend with whom I can eat dinner with! I don’t want to eat alone anymore…!
Er, well, even with the aid of the great Regina-sama, I’m not sure what I can…
… Is that so… I’m sorry…
Hey, Kazuma, what’s going on? Don’t tell me, the reason you invited me to the guild is because of that woman…!
… ? Yeah, I’m here to investigate Serena. I’m a little curious as to what she’s up to.
Y-You…! You said you reached an agreement with her! You were the one who told us not to look any further into her! I even… I-I even dressed up like this…
… Did you think I was inviting you out on a date or something?
N-No…! N-N-Not at…!
It doesn’t seem like you’ve spoken about me to anyone. Just a fair warning, this is also for their benefit. I might not be particularly combat focused, but I’m still a Demon King’s General. The Dark Goddess Regina is the patron of puppetry and vengeance. If I were to die, not only the person who killed me, but people in the general area would be struck by a powerful curse. At a guess, I’d say perhaps half the town would be wiped out.
There are a lot of different types of curses. Ones that render body parts useless, ones that petrify, and even some that are far crueler. If someone other than you finds out about my true identity, I’ll probably have no choice but to defend myself. In that case, there are bound to be a lot of casualties. You should think deeply on that if you ever think of breaking our deal.
Go ahead and stab my finger with your dagger. Ah, but don’t stab too deep now.
What are you saying? I can’t do that in front everyone. What are you, Aqua?
!?
… Do you understand now?
… This town is like my sanctuary of sorts. I won’t make an enemy of you. I don’t know exactly what you’re planning, but would you stop scheming in this town and go back to the Demon King’s castle?
Sorry to keep you waiting, Darkness…
Ojou-sama! Lalatina ojou-sama, what’s with your outfit!? What’s with your maiden-like outfit, ojou-sama!? It looks really cute!
Lalatina-chan, your frills are really cute! Don’t hide your face, let me have a good look!
Hey, ojou-sama, why are you blushing? Come on, strut your stuff!
Hey, don’t bully our ojou-sama! She’s not a display piece! Shoo, Shoo!
Hey, I’ve heard that Serena-sama’s holding a sermon! Get a move on!
It’s this way! You’ll miss out on seeing Serena-sama’s esteemed face if you don’t hurry!
Over here! Over here! Serena-sama’s about to start! Hurry up!
H-Hey, wait up! Why are all of you acting so odd? Serena-sama this and Serena-sama that… Isn’t she just a priest?
… What exactly happened to this town in the few days since I was sealed away in the mansion?
What do you mean sealed, you hikikomori? While you were cooped up at home, Serena has become the idol of this town.
… That woman really smells fishy. Well, since Kazuma told me not to go after her, I’ll leave it as it is.
… Well, her acts are praiseworthy, at the very least… It’s a little odd for me to be saying this, but the way she seems to have no human failings at all doesn’t quite sit well with me. Still, since Kazuma said that, I too will leave things be. At the end of the day, I always treat your warnings seriously. I won’t ignore your words and head off to do my own thing anymore.
Serena-sama! Serena-sama!
Serena-sama, please, please grant my wish!
Yes, yes, there’s no need to rush. Please line up orderly…! Regina-sama can grant any number of your wishes, and of course, there’s no need for any payment. Now, please.
Thank you very much, Serena-sama! The truth is…
Serena-sama! Please, this guy got heavily wounded during an extermination quest…! It’s a pretty serious wound! Can you please help him!?
… —Qua… Aqua… Nee-chan… please…
I’m right over here! Leave it to me, you’ll be completely fine in an instant!
Ah, what are you doing!? You’re in the way! Do you want a taste of my God Blow!? If I don’t heal him quickly…
Heal! Heal! Heal!
… T… T-T… Thank you very much, Serena-sama…!
Ah…
I want to be healed by Serena. There’s no need for you to do anything, so please get away from me.
… Kazuma, I don’t know what’s going on, or what exactly you’re troubled over right now, but it’s something you decided for everyone’s sakes, right? Then isn’t it fine? No matter what you choose, it always works out in the end.
… Indeed. I’m sure you thought hard about it before telling us not to get involved with her. That’s why… Just do as you wish so that you won’t have any regrets.
You remember our deal, yes? I hope you remember the kind of disaster that would befall this town if you break it. … Though.
You seem to be making quite the anguished expression. … Ah, yes, I still owe you a bit of gold, don’t I? … Hmm, if you attempt to challenge me alone without the aid of Wiz or Vanir or revealing my identity to anyone else… Yes, if you do that, I shall face you as a Demon King’s General without taking the inhabitants of this town hostage. … But you’re very similar to us. A coward and a realist, one who can weigh the pros and cons. I trust you won’t do something so foolish.
Now, my debt to you is cleared.
… W-What?
… You too? What do you want?
What’s up with you two? If you want to say something, just say it.
… What, you too? Seriously, say something already.
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san.
… Does this town not need a goddess like me?
Let go of me.
Ah…
Cast some support spells on me. Ones that increase my strength and speed.
Hey, Aqua.
…? Yes?
I’m probably about to take a whole lot of damage and get knocked out, so I’ll need you to heal me. Darkness, please take my unconscious body to the police station. Megumin, those people surrounding Serena right now will probably raise quite a fuss, so I’ll leave threa- soothing them to you.
W-What? Kazuma, what exactly are you saying!?
Wai-Kazuma, what are you planning to do!?
Hey, Kazuma-san, what are you doing? I have a really bad feeling about this…
Hey, wait, Kazuma, what are you doing all of a sudden…! I know I said to do as you wish, but that woman is merely suspicious. She hasn’t actually broken the law, so don’t do anything vio—!
K-Kazuma, I don’t know what you are doing, but you are really cool right now! It really tickles my Crimson Demon heartstrings!
Don’t encourage him, Megumin! Kazuma, wai—
Let’s both take a nap today! I’ll leave thinking about how to seriously get in your way for tomorrow!
… Don’t think you’ll be treated this cordially forever. I’ll ask again… Satou-dono, you dropkicked a passing priest who has done nothing to provoke you yesterday. Do you deny this?
I do not.
… Right, so you, upon seeing the back of the head of a passing priest, was seized with the uncontrollable urge to dropkick her. However, the priest detected your presence and turned around, causing you to kick her right in the face instead. In other words, you did it on a whim. Is that right?
That’s exactly the case.
… That priest is the same person that Lady Dustiness asked me to thoroughly investigate a few days ago. Does that have anything to do with this matter?
It doesn’t… Probably…
You piece of shit, do you think I’m some sort of inept retard!? We have been looking into that priest too! Do you really think that excuse will work on me!?
S-Stop! Using violence during interrogations is against the law! Get me a lawyer! I can afford it, so get me a lawyer!
Satou-dono, you’re speaking to a knight of Axel! One in charge of managing this police station! Naturally, I’m well aware of the odd atmosphere that has taken over this town as of late! You know something about this, right!? You might have a bad reputation, but even someone like you wouldn’t kick a woman for no reason! Considering your actions in the past, you must know something! Now, out with it! What are you hiding!? What is happening to this town!?
I-I know nothing! S-Stop! You’re a knight of a lower standing than house Dustiness, right!? I’ll tattle on you! I’ll tell Darkness that you did some unspeakable sexual things to me!
H-Hey, don’t fabricate things! In the first place, Lady Dustiness is well known for being just. I know she’s in the same party as you, but she wouldn’t unjustly exercise her power just because of that. Too bad for you! Just wait here, I’ll go fetch the lie detecting magic item!
I-I beg your pardon!
What is it!? I’m busy right now! This man keeps replying with empty platitudes…!
Well… Lady Dustiness wants to see him…
!?
Why is Lady Dustiness here? Tell her that I shall see her after I find out what this man is hiding. Satou-dono is a fairly accomplished adventurer, so a stay in the detention cells should suffice. I shall give her a detailed report after I’m done.
T-That’s…
What’s the matter?
My apologies, it’s me. I hope you don’t mind if I let myself in.
Lalatina-sama!
H-Hey, I told you not to call me Lalatina! … Ahem. My apologies. So, did you learn anything from him?
This man clearly knows something, but has told me nothing nothing but a stream of excuses like having struck her out of irritation or for fun… Please wait for a moment. I’ll rip out whatever it is that this man is hiding…!
… Kazuma, is that woman’s secret something you can’t tell even me or Aqua or Megumin?
… Is it bad if someone else knows about it? Are you saying to leave this incident to you? … If you can’t reply, it’s fine to remain silent.
So, well… Could you let him off on my account? Considering his previous achievements, couldn’t you file this incident as a fight between two adventurers…? 
Huh? … Umm, well… Are you certain, Lady Dustiness? The other party didn’t lodge any reports, so there’s no issues with this, but… you who hates abusing your authority…
Kazuma, you don’t have to say anything. I’ll leave this matter to you. However, I’ll handle the cleaning up… At least rely on me for that.
Dustiness-sama!
Hey, don’t grab onto me! I can’t unlock your chains if you move around that much!
U-Umm… Lady Dustiness, is your relationship with Satou-dono really that of simple party members…?
… We’re just party members. Right, Kazuma?
… Well, I suppose.
Y-Yeah, of course… Lady Dustiness is like a dignified exemplar that all of us female knights look up to. There’s no way she could be together with such an infamous man, and a commoner on top of that… Yeah, of course, they’re just friends…
Yes, indeed, we are just regular party mates. Party mates that take baths together and get into close contact in tight spaces. The kind of party mates where she asks me to remove her panties when she needs to use the toilet. What else? Oh, yeah, the kind where I’d sneak into her room in her mansion and push her down, and then she’d turn the tables and push me down. And there’s also that time where she tried to drug me to sleep. Yes, we’re just regular party mates.
!?
T-T-T-That’s no— That’s not true! I-It isn’t…
Y-Y-You two are… !? It’s— It’s that, right? You’re companions, after all! That’s just fooling around and teasing each other, right, Lady Dustiness!?
Awawa! Y-Yes, it’s just like that! It’s just… like…
Oh, yeah, we kissed.
!?
… You-You really are— How could you!? What should I do? That will become a rumour amongst the other knights and nobles… I’m not helping you again if you get caught! … Actually, I can’t show my face around this place anymore…
But none of those things I said were lies.
Say, Darkness, can I ask you for a favour?
Now, there’s no need to be embarrassed. Tell me about what’s troubling you… Oh, my, if it isn’t Kazuma-sama.
Yo, Serena. There’s no need to attach -sama to my name, it just makes us sound distant. Just Kazuma is fine.
You’re offering help to the troubled adventurers again, huh? It must be tough on you to do this every day. Do you want my help?
No, no, it wouldn’t do for me to take up the time of the busy Kazuma-sama. How about turning your strengths and efforts to getting rid of monsters instead?
… My apologies. Now then, why don’t you start by telling me about your troubles?
Um… It just never goes well no matter how I confess. Whenever I get close to girls, they always say ‘You’re a pretty good person’. They always say that, but then when I ask them to go out with me, they always decline…
Don’t you think being called a good person is the highest form of praise? Most other forms of charm and beauty fade away with time and age, but someone who’s beautiful on the inside will stand the test of time… Please continue being a good person. Being called as such by many people is quite charming on its own, don’t you think? It’s too soon for you to worry and despair over it. I’m certain the person who would fall in love with you would appear soon…
Y-Yes! I was feeling a little down since I kept getting rejected in the same way, but… thanks to you, I’ve cheered up a little. Serena-sama, thank you ver—
If he’s that charming, why don’t you just go out with him?
Serena even called you charming, you know? She went all the way out there to send those signals to you, so why the hell are you chickening out now!? The reason you’ve been rejected all this while is for this very moment!
Seriously!? Then… Serena-sama!
Y-You’re a good person, but, well…
Why are you giving up so easily!? Don’t just accept their words at face value! Women are complicated creatures! You need to learn how to read between the lines! Haven’t you heard of the term tsundere?
…… Tsun… Dere…?
U-Umm…
Saying no even though they like you. Haven’t you heard of this famous term before?
I-I do know of that phrase! I see, read between the lines…
Wai—
Serena-sama! I… I…!
W-Wait a minute! Please calm down…! Argh, you lit— K-Kazuma-sama!
It’s alright, Serena-sama. There’s no one nearby.
Wind, check. Distance, check. Angle, check.
Snipe!
Gaaah! Dammit, so she was drinking hot coffee!?
U-Um, Kazuma-san…? Err, I came with you because you said you wanted my help with something, but isn’t this against the law…?
Well, the act itself probably isn’t exactly praiseworthy, but… I’m begging you, Yunyun, I’m keeping this a secret from Megumin and the others. You’re the only one I can count on.
I’ll do it! Please let me do it! We are friends, after all! Leave it to me! You can rely on me for anything!
Is this okay, Kazuma-san? All that’s left now is to cast Silence on the door, right? Actually, the town has been really weird as of late. Does it have anything to do with what you’re doing now, Kazuma-san?
Yeah, it does. What we’re doing now is very close to a criminal act, but this is all to save this town, so don’t worry. Ah, of course, I’ll have to ask you not to tell anyone about tonight.
… … Right.
Ah…
Huff! Huff!
Serena-sama, we’ll do something about this ice soon, so please hold on for just a while more!
Argh! That’s why I said that a room at an inn with proper guards would be better! There would be a toilet attached too!
We can’t help it, we didn’t have the money! Serena-sama, please hold on for just a while longer! Hey, aren’t any of the adventurers who can use fire magic here yet!? What about hot water!? Or at least get a hammer or something to break through!
A hammer wouldn’t work on this! Some twisted guy sprayed the entire house with water before freezing it, so the entire thing is frozen solid! Ahh, what should we do…!?
S-S-So this is where you were, Kazuma-sama. I-I’ve been searching… wanting to meet with you.
Yo, if it isn’t Serena. It’s been some time. What’s wrong? You’re scaring the people around you with that face of yours, you know?
Yes, it has been some time, Kazuma-sama… May I ask what are you doing there?
Do you know of the balloons that they are selling at Wiz’s magic item shop? This is called a water balloon. It’s an item that expands upon being filled with water. Right now, instead of water, I’m filling it with a mixture of paint and starch—
Hey cut it…! I don’t know what you intend to do with that, but if you’re planning on playing some kind of prank with it, then I won’t stand idly by.
… Hey, what are you trying to do?
You are asking me that? … I’m almost at my limits. These people are almost completely under my control. If I order them to kill you, they’ll do it without blinking an eye… I really underestimated you. To think that just you alone could really push me to this level…! Yeah, you really had your fun, didn’t you!?
Hey, you were the one who told me to challenge you alone. I boldly rose up to your challenge, and now you, a Demon King’s General, is attacking me, the one with the weakest class, with numbers on your side. Don’t you think it’s unfa—
Shut the fuck up!!
How dare you! You sure enjoyed yourself spreading all those rumours about me, didn’t you!?
H-Hey, wait! As promised, I didn’t tell anyone about your true identity, so those rumours that I paid the blonde-haired delinquent to spread shouldn’t matter—
As if! Of all things, you had to spread the rumour that I’m actually a man! You even mixed in bits of truth like how my voice occasionally breaks…! Thanks to you, several people even asked me about it directly! There were even a few who said they’d prefer it if I was a man… Just what is wrong with this town!? You bastard… I’ll fucking kill you!
Hey, someone’s watching!
Kcht…! G-Good morning. The weather is quite nice today, isn’t it?
Oh, Serena-san. Good morning. Yes, the weather is pretty good today.
Then, allow me to cast a spell of protection on you for your safe journey…
Ah, thank you very much.
Then, safe journeys upon yo—
Wind Breath!
Bind!
Wha—
Serena-sama!
Se-Serena-sama is—!
Serena-sama is all bundled up!?
Aahh, thank the gods. What a divinely shaped ass…
Hey, wait, sto—!
Aah! Serena-sama… Serena-sama’s ass is in broad daylight…
Hey! Hide it! Form a wall! Hide her from view!
T-To think that Serena-sama wears black panties… I need to remember this…
Damn you Satou Kazuma! Don’t think you’ll get away with this! Once I get out of here…!
Oh no! The great Serena-sama is right here with her bottom exposed!
S-S-STOOOOOP!!!
So you’ve come to visit again, Satou-dono.
I’ve come to visit again, Chief.
Satou-dono, allow me to be frank. You’re a nuisance.
Even if you tell me that, I’m not exactly doing this because I want to…
… This time, that priest submitted an official report. Even if you have Lady Dustiness’s favour, it’d be hard for her to bail you out this time. Someone far higher ranked than her would have to vouch for you, otherwise…
Yeah, I suppose so.
Argh, dammit! Why were you caught so easily!? You could’ve easily escaped from us if you would’ve just put up a bit more resistance!?
Is that something a police chief should really be saying?
In the first place, what is that woman? All those people who saw her underwear ended up as her fervent supporters. Sure, she has a good body. In this town that’s filled with weirdos, she’s a rare sensible person… But even so, the pace at which she’s getting new converts is really strange. What, is it really her panties? Just by showing people your panties, you’ll get people to become your fans? Could even a hardheaded fool like me get a few fans if I flash my panties here and there for a bit? I know this town is a little out there, but still… Ah, dammit, if that’s the case, I might as well…!
Wait, all those people there ended up as her followers? Just by seeing her panties? I mean, sure, if there’s a religious organization where the lady priests show us their panties, I’d love to join it, but…
Satou-dono! Don’t just space out! Answer my question! You know about that woman’s secret, right!? Now, come on, out with it!
AAAAAAAAAH! WHAT THE HELL!? I was just on the verge of figuring it out! Why the hell must you interrupt me at the crucial point, you left-on-the-shelf knight!?
Ah, you actually said it! It’s not like we female knights don’t date because we don’t want to! Having children would be detrimental to our mission, so we’re just waiting for a wonderful man who would understand… Don’t cover your ears, Satou-dono! Listen to me! And if you’re going to call me left-on-the-shelf, at least introduce me to someone decent…!
Satou-dono! I don’t care about his personality, as long as he has a somewhat modest income… The important thing is being able to do housework! A house husband would be best. Apart from that, telling me, ‘I love you,’ once every day—
Say, chief, can I make a request of you?
… What is it?
I would like to send a letter. Money is no object, I just need to send a letter to an acquaintance in the capital. Express, of course.
Now then, Satou-sama, please take care. If you ever find yourself in trouble, please feel free to rely on us.
A-Ah… Thanks…
To think that Satou-sama is connected to not only the Dustiness family, but the Symphonia family as well… And for that Claire-sama to write back with specific instructions not to give you any cause for offense… This is the first time I’ve seen that happen.
I wondered what happened when Rain-dono appeared here in tears while bearing Claire-sama’s letter… You really are a playboy, Satou-sama! Not just Lady Dustiness, but even Claire-sama and Rain-dono…!
Err, well… That’s not quite the case, but nevermind…
… By the way, where are those two right now? I would like to give them my regards.
Claire-sama said that she’d be taking a vacation at a hidden villa starting today, so she wouldn’t be in the capital even if you went there. Rain-dono was handling the paperwork for your release, but the moment she was done, she used Teleport and disappeared off somewhere.
Satou-sama, from now on, we’ll turn a blind eye to any happenings in town, so feel free to tease or investigate or do whatever else you want to that priest!
T-Thanks…
You know, you said you looked up to Darkness and stuff a few days ago, so I thought you’d be a more inflexible person…
A great noble like her would be able to have her pick of any handsome noble scion she wishes, but despite that, she chooses to be alone. We nobles who are similarly alone look up towards her and admire her for that… Come to think of it, Satou-sama, in addition to having such amazing contacts, you also have fame and a mansion, right?… Not only that, but you have a fortune that would put several nobles to shame, no?
… I-I suppose…
I’m Aloerina, 23, single, the surprisingly devoted type, and pretty amazing when the lights go—
Well, I have to go! Thank you for your hospitality! I’ll repay you someday!
Welcome home, Kazuma! Thank you for your hard work!
Say, with this, you’ve been in the care of the police for more times than I’ve been, right? You can’t call me an ex-convict anymore, can you!? Say, how does it feel, Kazuma-san who called the police on me when I took over the mansion? The same Kazuma-san who called me ex-convict who knows how many times after that? So how does it feel? How do you feel now!?
Hey, you didn’t wait for me here just because of a stupid reason like that, did you!? Don’t screw with me! Why do you think I spent so much time in the care of the police!? In the first place, I got arrested in the process of protecting the peace of the town! Don’t compare it to the petty crime you did, you Goddess of Criminals!
Waaah! How could you say that?! You’ll get divine punishment, you shitty NEET! Why don’t you tell me the reason why you ended up in the care of the police so many times!? Come on, say it! If your conscience is clean, then why don’t you come out and say it!?
Argh, fine, I did it because I couldn’t stand that priest, alright? There’s no other reason in particular, so hurry up and get back inside the mansion. What happened to Darkness and Megumin anyway? I told them to keep an eye on you.
Those two were caught in my certain-kill party trick, the ‘Type 100 Mist’! Once activated, it’d last for at least half a day before fading. Actually, they just got bored after holing up in the mansion for so long. Being a NEET and spending all day indoors gets old really quickly. You’re being so unfair, Kazuma. You’ve been staying outside all this while, right? I want to go to a slumber party too. Take me with you.
Yo, aren’t you early, Satou Kazuma. I’ve been waiting… You have your companion with you today? Well, no matter. Let’s settle our score, Kazuma. I’m almost boiling over with rage right now!
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san! What is going on!? Why are those people chasing us!? I don’t think I’ve done anything… I can think of a few reasons why they might be chasing us, but why!?
Properly apologize when they regain their senses! Dammit, how many people did she turn into her followers while I was in jail!? No one is taking notice even all the ruckus we’ve been causing!
I thought she was more of a schemer! Doing this just because I teased her a little is way too rash! Her actions are getting more and more overboard!
Hey, I thought you were arrested for sexual harassment! Just what did you do to that priest to make someone as gentle as her so mad!?
Nothing much! I just froze her inside a house with no toilet, spread some strange rumours about her, and called a lot of people to see her when her panties were visible for about an hour, that’s all!
You can’t complain if she kills you over that!
Hey, Aqua, do you sense anything when you look at these people!? You wiped out the curse on Darkness’s dad in a snap back then, didn’t you!? Can’t you sense any evil power at work here!?
My divine eyes tell me that the most evil existence in this town is the man running next to me!
The only path ahead of you leads to a dead end, Satou Kazuma! Did you not notice the arrangement of the people on the streets!? It’s all to lead you to a deserted area. The only thing ahead of you is…!
Hey, Aqua, they’ll catch up at this rate! Crouch down below the wall and fling me over it! I’ll pull you up once I’m on top! We’ll be able to escape that way.
I see, what a wonderful idea! Then, Kazuma, why don’t you fling me over!? I’ll pull you up once I get on top of the wall!
Y-You little…
Pant… Pant…H-Have you finally given up, Satou Kazuma…! Y-You’ve got a pretty good priest there…Pant… Pant…That’s some pretty powerful… Support spells…Pant… Pant…
Welcome! We have been awaiting you, dear customers! The weather is nice today, so Moi and the shopkeeper have decided to set up an open air store here!
Ah, welcome! It’s just like Vanir-san said, we’ve gotten customers even in such a place!
Hey, what are you selling? … Actually, are you okay? Smoke is coming out from your head, you know?
Vanir-san went off the handle just now, saying ’I just got rid of the Bug Killerin, and you brought in another bunch of weird stuff!’… But don’t worry, Aqua-sama. I just drank some sugar water earlier, so my body will automatically heal up. Even if the worst comes to worst, I can just drink some water from anywhere… Ah, Aqua-sama, that’s Vanir-san’s recommended item for the day.
Hey, Vanir, what’s the meaning of this? Are you still not satisfied after taking all the money I had on hand?
Did you pull the strings behind the scene this time? No, actually, what are you doing setting up shop at the end of a dead alley that I got chased into? Just how much did you forsee this time?
Fuhahahaha! Now, now, there’s no need to be so angry, you two. Right now, my job is to earn money, so Moi shall appear at any place that smells of money. Worry not, Moi has prepared items that would be of great benefit to the both of you. So, would you like to take a look?
Hey, don’t think of doing anything strange now. Let’s make a truce for today.
Now, now, you two, stop standing there whispering to each other and give my products a look. Even without using my all-seeing gaze, Moi is certain that there’ll be something that’ll have the two of you jumping for joy.
First is this! This is a contract that states that Moi will not interfere no matter what you’re plotting in this town—
Say, Vanir, I can definitely pay a higher price for that than her, so would you mind selling that to me?
Hey, hey, this is a first come, first served sort of thing. Vanir, how much is this?
730,330 Eris.
All of my money again!? I only just managed to save up this much, you piece of shit!
Thank you for your patronage~!
Oh, yeah, Serena, you still owe me some money, don’t you!? Pay me back right now! You were the one who said you’d face me as a Demon King’s General if I challenge you alone! It’d be something else if you face me one on one, but if you are going to break your promise and send a bunch of guys after me, then pay me back right now! … Hehehe, with this, you’ll have to return what you just bought from Vanir, right?
Y-You bastard… Dammit. Hey, you!
Give me some money… There, will this do!?
… ? … Huh? W-What am I doing here…?
Tsk.
Umm, can I have a moment?
That’s odd. I’m pretty sure I was… Ah, what is it, Serena-san? Why are you holding the hem of your skirt…
Umm… What do you think after seeing this?
Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Thank you ver…y…
Oh, did you see that? That priest that looks so refined actually did something like that! What a pervert!
Celestina-san… You always were a little boorish, but when did you become so bold…
Celestina? Do you know that priest?
Hey, Vanir, with this, you won’t get in my way anymore, right? I can take this as a contract, right?
Indeed, we have made a contract. Worry not, we devils absolutely will not break a contract. … Now, boy.
Hey, boy, Moi is about to recommend some products to you.
… Hey, boy who’s been staying outside as of late to enjoy a certain service that gives him visions of the two girls back at the mansion and pretty much all the women present right—
Yes, yes, show me the goods! What do you want me to buy, Vanir!? My wallet is quite full right now, so I’ll buy anything you have to offer!
… What’s this?
This case contains the ‘Useless Potions Series’ that this worthless shopkeeper bought in the past.
For instance, this is the Stats Up Potion (Changed). It’s made from a regular stats up potion, and is more effective than its regular counterparts.
… And its side effects?
As it increases one of your stats, its paired stat will decrease.
So, what would happen if I drink it?
Your strength will increase tremendously, but in return, your intelligence will decrease.
It might be pretty useful for a frontline combat class that doesn’t require much intelligence to do their job…
So, how much is this reduction in intelligence?
It would definitely end up lower than this boy’s blue-haired priest.
Then what about these? The first part of Forbidden Potions Series! This potion will allow you to draw the ire of monsters for the rest of your life when you drink it! Perfect for earning experience points! Or this one that’ll raise your magic power in exchange for killing your hair follicles! Or this one that’ll reduce your magic to zero but raise your levels by leaps and bounds! Or this potion that attracts the opposite sex but make you smell like a goblin? Or this level reset potion that’s perfect for masochists who would wish to relieve their harsh training?
They are all defective products! I don’t need them!
Or this potion that cures the Puppet status effect?
What!?
Oh, that seem to have caught both your interest. This is a potion that cures the unique status ailment ‘Puppet’. That said, that’s a very rare status effect that no extant monsters can inflict. As far as Moi is aware, the only one that can inflict it right now is a minor Dark Goddess…
Don’t refer to Regina-sama as a minor Dark Goddess!
Is this the only bottle you have?
… Didn’t you make a contract not to get in my way?
Fuhahahahaha, the all-seeing devil so declares! Even if these potions fall into this boy’s hands, they will not get in your way! In fact, there will come a day when you’ll be deeply thankful that this boy has these potions on hand. Now, boy, the Forbidden potion series, and that Puppet curing potion I just gave you is a free service! Now, here comes the main event! How much are you willing to pay for a case of those potions over there…!
Ah, Aqua-sama, what are you doing? Those potions might not be of much use now, but Vanir-san has been carefully preparing them since morning. You shouldn’t stick your finger in them.
Nevermind that, you’re starting to turn a little see through, you know? Have you been taking in enough water? It’s great that you have so many useless potions right now. Here, I’ve turned them all into clean water, so douse yourself with them and cool off.
Sorry, Aqua-sama. Thank you very much… But Aqua-sama’s divine power is making me sort of numb…
…Snicker.
!
Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! Moi has really overlooked you this time! Moi should’ve taken care of this goddess of toilets a long time ago!
Do it if you think you can, you Masked Devil! I don’t know what kind of goods you were trying to sell to our Kazuma, but aren’t you embarrassed at all to lose your temper just because things aren’t going your way? Are you really a Great Devil? Is your title self proclaimed? How do you feel after having your products ruined? Come on, tell me! It’s really amazing! Kususu! Fukususu!
Vanir Style Death Ray!
… Hey, what should we do about those two?
… Why are you asking me? In the first place, just what is that priest to be able to fight with Vanir like that?
Well, the only one who could’ve stopped them got taken out instantly, so there’s really nothing we can do. I’m not considered particularly strong amongst the Generals… Aah, this feels really stupid. Doesn’t seem like anything good will come out of tangling with you… There are too many strange folks hanging around you. Other than Vanir and that priest who’s currently fighting him to a standstill, you also know a lot of other dangerous people, don’t you?
Uwah…
Sigh…Oh, fine, I give up on this town. Truth be told, I underestimated you. I should’ve come at you with full force right from the start.
You bitch of a goddess, Moi shall have you compensate me for all the potions you rendered useless today!
Ahahaha! Devil who believes that everything moves according to his plans, only to get his hopes dashed at the last moment every single time! I shall not compensate you! In fact, I turned your useless potions into Aqua’s beautiful and delicious water, so if anything, you should be paying me!
Don’t you dare imitate me! Those lines are my trademark! That is it! Moi shall beat you black and blue and take every last coin you have!
Then we’ve reached an understanding, right? Just to say it again, I have absolutely no interest in the Demon King, so there’s no need to treat me as a threat. To be honest, even if you tell me that the Demon King and humanity are at war over the state of the world and whatnot, when I’m living in such a peaceful town, it really doesn’t resonate with me at all. Seriously, if you leave me alone, I won’t cause any trouble for you.
Yes, yes, I get it. I’ll tell the Demon King that neither you nor this town is worthy of his attention, so there’s no need to worry so much about them. And I’ll leave this town too. That’ll be fine, right?
Right, then, we have a deal…Sigh.You said you weren’t strong amongst the Generals, but even then, I was really breaking out into cold sweat while facing you. In the first place, rather than charging right at someone with the weakest class like me, a General should act like one and come up with some grander schemes…
Well, I didn’t have it easy either. Though I don’t really care about any of it now…Sigh, I’m not looking forward to this… This might be the end of your part in this, but I still need to report to the Demon King afterwards.
Either convince you to join us, or kill you. Those were my original orders regarding you… Well, I’ll tell you something. The truth is, I wasn’t exactly looking forward to clashing with you either. I’ll forget about how you exposed me in front of half the town, so you forget about a bunch of things too, alright?
Yeah, yeah. After this, we are both even, okay?
With this, you won’t be targeted by the Demon King’s army anymore. Oh, one more thing, your companion. She was called Megumin, wasn’t she? There was a pretty large bounty on her head too, so I’ll get rid of that for you.
Oh, please do that. Oh, wait, wouldn’t I have something like that too? If I have a bounty on my head, please take care of that too.
Yes, yes, leave it to me. I’ll handle it.
… Sigh. You know, you could be a little more thankful to me, right?
Oh, yeah, thank you. But, leaving me aside, just what were you planning to do in this town anyway. This is just a town of beginners…
…You finally said it.
My, my, you really are something. You already figured out how my power works, right? You might be the first one to get this close to figuring out the true form of my power.
You wanted to know what I’m planning in a town of beginners like this, right? There, there, I’ll tell you all about it, so be thankful to me, okay? You asked, so of course I’ll answer. I listened to you request, so you’ll owe me for this, right?
You coward! Stop using Wiz as a shield! … Hey, actually, don’t you think Wiz has gotten really see through right now?
Then you stop throwing around purification spells! … No, no, this is taking things too far. That’s a warning sign. At this rate, the storekeeper will vanish for real.
W-W-What should we do!? Really, what do we do!? If I cast healing on her, she’ll just vanish faster!
There’s some sugar water in that bag over there, so let the storekeeper drink some. This usually works out. She’ll spring right back like a snake after shedding its skin… probably.
The truth is, the army will dispatch a division to this town not to long in the future. But, well, this town is the town furthest away from the front lines. There’s no way we can march an entire army all over the country to this town. Thus, only a small amount of units are scheduled to be sent here through Teleport. But, well, for a town of beginners, that is more than enough.
Do you know the fallen angel, Duke? He went missing around this town a while ago.
It seems like you do. Could it be that you took care of him too? Well, we received a message from him before he disappeared, warning us to be wary of you.
Ah, don’t get the wrong idea. This town has been a target for quite some time. Even before the Generals started disappearing and high bounty targets started getting taken out.
W-Why…?
Because this is the town of fledging adventurers. Because this is the town of beginnings. I might be a Demon King’s General, but I’m still a human. I even used to be an adventurer, you know? And of course, when I first started as an adventurer, I was directed to this town. Everyone picked up their first quest here. This is the town of beginners, Axel. The weakest monsters all over the world are purposely cultivated and given a breeding population here. A town specifically meant to raise newbie adventurers.
Then, what would happen if this place were to be destroyed? Goblins might be known as a staple training target, but even their rusty blades are dangerous to newbie adventurers fresh out of the gates. Giant frogs can be taken down as long as you get enough people on your side, and the only place where they breed is here. If this town didn’t exist, exactly where would newbie adventurers go to train?
Do you get it? Apart from a few exceptions like the Crimson Demons with their mysterious training method, all famous adventurers had their start in this very town. They raise their levels here before setting off towards other towns. Unless they have some special reason, most adventurers will stay in this town until they gain quite a few levels under their belt. And those people will eventually end up facing off against us.
Now that the people bearing strange names have stopped showing up, if this town disappears too, the recruitment of adventurers will cease entirely… You know of the strongest of the Demon King’s Generals? The Demon King’s daughter? She’s currently planning a large scale attack on the fortresses along the frontlinew and the capital. That will surely cause significant casualties amongst the adventurers… And, if those guys who are desperately holding the line and awaiting new reinforcements were to hear that the training ground of new adventurers, the town of Axel is destroyed…
… I guess you’re nearing your limit. This power isn’t a curse. No matter what kind of person you are, there’s no way you can resist it. Especially not a man like you. But don’t worry. If I give you an order you really hate, you’ll still be able to resist. It might cause you great pain, though. But it’s you we are talking about. I’m sure you won’t simply lay back and submit to being my puppet… Now, let me enjoy finding out exactly how much you will resist my orders…!
Now, listen very closely… You feel something at the depths of your heart, don’t you? That’s all the humiliation, injustice, and ridicule you’ve suffered… Think back. You’ve been looked down on by the inhabitants of this town, right? Have you ever been laughed at for having the weakest job? Have your companions ever slowed you down or gotten in your way?
Yes, why do you have to always clean up after everyone? There’s no need to hold it in any longer. Throw away your restraints, your common sense, your morality, your conscience. Throw them all away… Now, it’s time to take your revenge along with me. Very soon, my friends will gather in this town. When that time comes, you will help us alongside the other puppets. Now, it’s time to take your revenge. Revenge on the inhabitants of this town, and your former companions—!
—Wiz, are you okay? Do you know who I am?
…? Aqua-sama? And Vanir-san? What’s the matter? Why are the two of you so close to me?
Hmm, if you don’t remember what happened, then there’s no need to worry yourself. It’s best not to force yourself to remember.
Y-Yeah! If you don’t remember, it’s probably best not to dwell on it.
Kazuma! We should head home soon. It’s kind of scary watching Darkness and Megumin rummage around the house like bears while you were out. Let’s head home and calm those two down.
…?
This man said he doesn’t want to go back to you guys anymore. He wants to become my companion. Isn’t that right, Kazuma? You don’t need those potions anymore, do you? Come on, tell it to them.
I’ll be of the Regina cult as of today. I’ll be working together with Serena-sama from now on, so send my regards to the rest for me.
Say, you’re currently puppeted right now, right? You’ll do anything I say, right?
Of course, Serena-sama. Even If you would order me to hold up your breasts in place of your bra for an entire day, I would happily obey.
A-Ah, is that so… I wouldn’t give you such a ridiculous order, so don’t worry. None of the other puppets have ever declared that they would join the Regina cult, so I just… but well, there’s no need to worry about that.
… Finally…
Do you know how long I have been waiting for this moment!? Do you have any idea how much shame I endured at the hands of the Demon King’s Army after Regina-sama was captured and sealed by the Crimson Demons!?
No, I do not.
Is that so? Then just stay silent and listen! A few years ago, the seal on Regina-sama was broken for some reason. And I only recently regained my powers. One day, out of the blue, the power Regina-sama gave me suddenly increased several fold! Yes, Regina-sama gave me who have been struggling for so long her blessings!
Isn’t that because the Regina cult was just you at that moment?
I told to you listen quietly! I’m in a good mood right now, so don’t ruin it!
Incidentally, Serena-sama, what’re the conditions to remove the puppet status from me?
… You are really puppeted, right? Why do you need to know that information?
It’s nothing major, but I’d be quite troubled if I were to be released from Serena-sama’s puppetry. I simply wish to keep my distance from any situations that seem like they’d be able to do so.
… You…? … Yes, I can feel the power of Regina-sama coming from you. What’s happening here? Could that be it? Did I put too much power into it and overdo the brainwashing…? Rather than ending up as a puppet, it’s more like I’ve gained a devoted underling capable of independent thought… Well, no matter. It suits my purposes just fine. Keep at it.
Of course, Serena-sama.
Very well, I shall tell you. This will be helpful to you too. The first is if your feelings of owing something to me were to change, but you already know that. Next is a strong faith… You know, back when you bound me up and exposed my panties to my puppets, they regained their senses for an instant, right? Those kinds of ‘stroke of good luck’ events that would make people thank their god are particularly dangerous. I don’t know what kind of god you worship, but do take note of that.
Don’t worry, the one I worship is Regina-sama. If something erotic were to happen as you were out doing your everyday business, the one I would be thanking is Regina-sama.
I-Is that so…? Don’t push yourself. There’s not a single human who doesn’t have faith in something. It doesn’t have to be towards a god, even if such notions were directed to a devil or a Dark Goddess, it’d still be effective. What did you worship before you started worshipping Regina-sama?
No, I didn’t worship anything.
Haha, I see. Well, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Let’s get along, partner.
Right, we’ll stay here for today. It’s a little on the expensive side, but it’s fine every once in a while. Kazuma, go pay for it.
I refuse.
… What did you just say?
I said I refuse. If I pay for your stay here, my feelings of owing something to you will be resolved. The puppetry on me will be dispelled.
Aah… right… But, still… O-Oh, well…
Ah! Dammit, I forgot that Vanir took all my money again! Hey, Kazuma, I don’t care if it voids the puppetry or whatever, just lend me some money! I’ll release a few puppets to strengthen my control over you. Just lending me a bit of money won’t…
You can’t do that, Serena-sama! Getting complacent like that is especially dangerous! All the villains I know of in manga and games always end up losing because they get complacent at the very end. Don’t worry, I’ll just go borrow some money from those people over there.
M-Manga? Game? … O-Oh, very well, thank you… Ah, but, wouldn’t that just end up with you clearing your feelings of indebtness too…?
Sorry, can I have a moment? You see, Serena-sama here has a bit of money trouble and can’t afford to pay for the inn right now. She’s poor and has few survival skills, so won’t you take some pity on her and gift a bit of offering to her?
Eeh!?
Serena-sama is in trouble? Leave it to me, I’ll give poor Serena-sama… Serena-sama? Why did I start attaching -sama to her name? … Ah, nevermind. Here. Seriously, what’s a priest doing asking for money? Please work harder, Serena-san.
Ah… U-Um… Thank you very much.
Aah… That man was a pretty skilled adventurer… Oh well. Come on, Kazuma, hurry up and pay for the room with that money.
Roger that. But, before that…
Y-Y-You little!? W-What are you doing!? Just what are you doing!?
Calm down, Serena-sama. You’re attracting attention.
That’s my line! Yeah, people are watching! What are you doing!? Why did you suddenly start fondling my boobs!
What are you saying? I just borrowed money for your sake, you know? In other words, the feeling of obligation I hold towards you just weakened. Thus, if I don’t get some repayment from you, my puppetry will be dissolved. But, right now, Serena-sama doesn’t have any money, so I have to get my repayment through your body.
!?!?!? I-Is that so? No, wait, isn’t it odd? I mean, that adventurer earlier said he’d give the money to me… I attracted such gazes and even lost a puppet… It’s like I just set myself up… ?
—Sigh…Did I get myself a trump card, or did I not… I don’t even know for sure right now…
You seem exhausted, Serena-sama. Would you like me to give you a shoulder massage?
Hmm? Ah, sure, go ahead…
… Wait, why are you in this room?
Well, the money we got is only enough to pay for one room… Ah, I won’t complain even if the bed is narrow, so don’t mind me.
I will mind! I will mind it very much! What’s with you!? Why are you climbing into my bed like it’s only natural? Weren’t you more of a coward when it came to women!?
Serena-sama, you were the one who ordered me, didn’t you? … Throw away your restraints, your common sense, your morality, your conscience. Throw them all away… I’m simply following your orders. It feels like I’ve been reborn.
So that’s it!!!!
… Say, if I rescind that order, will you still feel like you owe me a huge debt?
Thanks to you removing the limiters on my heart, I’m actually enjoying life quite a bit right now. If you ask me to regain my senses again, that blow probably couldn’t be smoothed over by just letting me fondle your breasts for a bit.
Gurk…
You know… Why do I have to prepare a place to sleep for you? Just go find a place to sleep on your own… The other puppets all see to their own accommodations.
My circumstances are a little special. Unlike the other adventurers, thanks to Serena-sama, I can’t go back home right now. You need to properly support me there.
Gurk… B-But, well, now that I have brought you over to my side, my victory is more or less assured. I’m going to work you to the bone! Be prepared for some hard work tomorrow!
Just then, I felt something soft press against my back. Yes, a naked Serena-sama is currently pressing both her peaks against my body. ‘Kazuma-sama, I can’t hold myself back anymore…’ Oh dear… I carefully embraced Serena-sama who was looking at me with puppy eyes…
Comforting you will cost 5000 eris and your breasts.
I was thinking of returning you to that Priest today-
I refuse.
Ow!
You really didn’t believe in anything before? You’ve completely become a Regina cultist!
I’ve said it all this time, didn’t I? I didn’t believe in anything before, but now I only worship Regina-sama.
As if such a person could exist in this world! Whether it’s a god or a dark god or a devil, most everyone here will have their faith in something!
Well, I wasn’t from this country in the first place. Plus, it’s not that unusual where I come from. There are plenty of people who don’t subscribe to any particular faith where I used to live.
Wha-!?
S-Seriously?
I’m serious. Ah, though perhaps it’s slightly inaccurate to say they don’t have a faith. Most of my countrymen throw a big celebration for the birthday of a major prophet for one of the sects, then the next month they’ll ring the bells of a different sect to welcome the new year. And when they get older, they’ll follow the traditions of a sect known as Shinto to pray for their well being for the next year.
Is your country picking a fight with the Priests?
What should I do… How do I break the puppetry on you? Even if I try to repay what you owe me, you stubbornly refuse to accept it. When I order you to get out of the room, you start resisting fiercely despite the pain. And now that you’re a Regina Cultist, if I try to lay a hand on you, the curse of vengeance will…
Ah, dammit! What should I do! What should I… Hey, what can I do to get you to stay away from me!?
Because of what you did when you asked me to follow you, my relationship with my companions is in tatters. It’d be troublesome if you don’t take responsibility for—
AAAAAAAAAA! I CAN’T HEAR YOU! I CAN’T HEAR YOU! … Ah, right! Hey, didn’t you get a potion that cures puppetry along with that forbidden potion series that Vanir gave you? What happened to that?
I gave it to that priest with the ability to turn any liquid she touches into water…
Aaaaaah! Of all the people in the world, why did you have to give it to someone with such a power!?
How did it end up this way… It was going so well, so where did I go wrong!? Dammit, I was so close…! The puppeting of the adventurers was proceeding smoothly, and I would’ve completed my preparations with just a little more time…! Just where did I go wrong!?
It’ll be fine, Serena-sama. You have me, don’t you?
You are the cause of all of my problems!
You…! You wouldn’t listen to a word I say and made nothing but selfish requests! That’s why I… Gurk!
Gurk! … S-Serena-sama, if you strangle me, then you’ll also…!
Dammit…! Dammit…! Dammit all! Why…!? Why did you become a cultist so easily…!? Choosing a god to serve is a once in a lifetime decision, so at least put some thought into it!
Even if you say that, there were a ton of different faiths in the country I came from… They say there are eight million gods in the country I used to live in… So adopting a faith isn’t really that heavy a decision. I heard there are even people who worship a flying spaghetti monster or something.
I hate your country… I hate it so very much…
… You like black, I see.
… Naaaaaaaaaaagh!
I’m going to your mansion! You’ll probably follow me even if I tell you not to, so just hurry up!
Is that an order? Then, I would need some compensation—
Then fine, stay here!
You want me to watch the house all by myself? Putting me through such boredom would require a really large amount of compensation.
No, no, just shut up! Shush! Talking to you right now makes my head hurt!
Open up! You’re in here, right!? Open up! I’m here to return your precious companion! Open up!
Dammit! Why now of all times…! Hey, come on, let’s go! They might be at the guild!
Hey, what are you doing!? Stop standing there and hurry up…!
Hey, come on, hurry up and get over here! Seriously, why the hell do you never listen to my orders!?
No, it’s just, Serena-sama, there’s a girl standing at the window…
What are you saying? A girl? Are you starting to hallucinate now? … No, wait, I can smell the scent of ghosts hanging around this mansion… You didn’t gain simple priest powers in addition to the protection of Regina, did you…? No, wait, who cares about that right now? Come on, hurry up.
Huh? Outside the town?
Yeah, especially around this time of day.
Why would they go out of town for? Is there something out there?
Well, not particularly. It’s more like our mage’s daily routine. They most probably all headed out together. It’s about the right time for it.
Tell me about these sorts of things earlier!
Serena-sama, now that we are here, I want to get something to eat too.
… I’m not paying for it. I no longer have any need to keep you in my debt.
Excuse me, give me everything on the menu, and put it on her tab.
I’m not paying for it! I really am not! … Ah, I’ll… I’ll have a cup of water, please…
Hey… Hey, you know where your companions went, right? Just tell me the location. I’ll head on over by myself, you can stay here and enjoy your meal while I do that.
I refuse. There’s no way I can let you head out of town on your own. My party consists of an Archwizard famous for having a screw loose, an Archpriest whose power possibly exceeds your own, and a girl whose only merit is being tough. I find it very unlikely that my party will sit there and hear you out. If you run into them outside of town, it’ll most likely end in a fight.
… Right, then come with me after you’re done eating what you ordered. There’s something I can try if they are outside of town… I’m going to have to put you to some proper work for once.
—You are quite late, Serena-sama. I almost grew bored waiting for you. What were you doing? You treated me, but with all that waiting, I’d say the balance sheet is just about even now.
… Y-You… You really are…
Did it taste good?
Yeah, it did! It would’ve tasted better if I didn’t had to wash dishes until now in order to pay for my food!
Aaah, I don’t have time for this! Come on, Kazuma, hurry up and dig up the corpses buried under here! I’m going to puppet them and turn them into my soldiers! I’ll start from here, so you go over there!
My apologies, for religious reasons, I cannot do something so blasphemous.
Aren’t you a Regina cultist!? What religious reasons could you have!? If you just don’t want to touch a corpse, then just say so! Just do it! Stop saying selfish things and start putting in some work for once!
Seriously, spare me.
Fucking fine! Forget it! Just stand there and watch!
Pant… Pant…Y-Yes, I got one! I just need to puppet this guy and let him dig up the rest… Marionette!
But you don’t have enough puppet points.
What!?
H-Hey, what do you mean by puppet points!? What exactly is going…
You’re talking about the amount of control power I have invested in you! Don’t give it such a flippant name! Hey, Kazuma, don’t resist, you hear? I’m going to pull back a bit of the power I have invested in you to keep you a puppet. Really, don’t resist, you hear!? I really want to get rid of you, but if I release you from my hold right now, you’ll definitely get in my way. So, really, you get it? I’m reducing my hold on you to increase the number of puppets under my control, so, seriously, don’t resist.
You know, with how insistent you are about this, it almost sounds like set up for a punchline. Is it fine for me to take it as such?
Of course not! Seriously, don’t resist. Right, here goes… I just told you not to resist! You’re my puppet, so listen to my orders already!
G-Gurk… W-Wait, Serena-sama, please listen to me! After all the time you spent washing dishes, it’s already close to evening… Those three would probably be back at home by now—
Tell me that sooner! In the first place, whose fault do you think it is that I had to spend all that time washing dishes!? Fuck this shiiiiit!
Who is it at this time of day? I’d welcome you if you’re a salesman, but if you’re a religious solicitor, go elsewhere!
It’s me. I’m here to return your man to you.
Kazuma-san? … Really? Are you really…?
Don’t do anything to mess this up, you hear? If you end up back inside, I’ll definitely give you a worthy reward.
Why don’t you just give it to me now?
… Can I ask what that man is doing?
Don’t worry about that. Actually, I’m here to return him.
… Kazuma, what exactly are you doing? It really is strange for such a spineless person to be doing such acts in broad daylight. I know you like doing this sort of things, but at least try to pass it off as an accident or cover it with an excuse. You use all kinds of underhanded tricks when doing such things with me, but now…
… Even when I make advances on him, he always gets scared and chickens out before long. This is both his good point and a bad point. Just what did you do to get him to act like this? In the first place, there’s been a lot of rumours about you and Kazuma these past few days. Just what do you mean by you’re returning him? Rendering him into such a pathetic state… This… This is…
… Actually, we don’t need such a Kazuma. If you’re going to return him, put him back in his original packaging. Taking something from someone and returning it after you broke it is quite horrible, don’t you think?
Let’s strike a deal. I’ll return him to normal. In return, you’ll give me that potion he gave to you. If you do that, I’ll properly bring him back to his senses and give him back to you.
I refuse. This is something Kazuma-san gave me before he collapsed from stress. There’s no way I will give it to you. What are you going to use this potion for? What did that strange devil say to you? Tell me what you intend to do with this potion.
… You should listen to what I’m saying before I lose it. It wouldn’t do for you to look down on me. I’m still a—
It’s something Kazuma gave to me, so it’s really important! I refuse!
Fine, very well. Our negotiations are over. Eat this!
Death!
… Huh?
Get her!
Dammit, my magic…! Why!? Regina-sama! Regina-sama! Grant me strength—
Now, release your curse on this man… W-What’s this? I can’t breathe…?
Death! Death! Dea—
… Say, you two, I really don’t think we need such a thing…
Er… Er, well, we probably don’t want this thing either.
… Girls really like black, huh?
M-Megumin!?
When did you become so bold, Megumin!?
Right, if no one wants him, I’ll be taking this man for myself.
Ah!?
… Oh, I see. The blessings that the minor goddess Regina has been granting you were cut in half, wasn’t it? The blessings of a god are divided amongst their followers. That goddess of yours must be so minor that you are her only true follower, right? All of her powers used to be granted to you, but that’s no longer the case now that Kazuma has become her follower too.
!?
Now, turn Kazuma back to normal.
… He’ll return to normal if you give that potion to him. He might resist you, however.
Fufu, it’s been some time, Kazuma.
Still, how did he end up like this? Just what did you do? What’s so fun about turning our Kazuma into such a brazen pervert?
I didn’t expect he’d turn out this way either! I just sought to turn him into my puppet. I unleashed his true desires and removed his inhibitions… But he turned out being way more wilful than I expected.
… It was really horrible, these past few days… He refuses to work no matter what reasons I give, and does perverted stuff whenever he can. He’s just been indulging in his desires to live a decadent life…
… That doesn’t sound very different from how Kazuma was originally… But, nevermind. He’ll recover if I use this potion on him, right?
… I don’t really mind if he remains like this…
Hey, Kazuma, I’m going to turn you back to normal now, so don’t do anything, okay?
This is fine.
We can’t have that. Just stay right there. Right there is fine…
Hey, Priest, don’t let your guard down! That man is definitely up to something!
I-I know that. How long do you think I’ve been with Kazuma? Megumin, make sure to keep a tight grip on him! Right, then…
Steal.
Ah!
Eat this!
Waaaaah!
That’s why I told you! That man is definitely up to something!
There’s nothing I can do about that! You should know this after being on the receiving end of his antics! There’s no telling what this man will do! Megumin! Megumin! Do something!
Satou Kazuma! As my puppet, I order you to stay right there! Just stay still for a moment!
Oh fine. I don’t really mind him staying this way, but… Here, Kazuma, let me give you a hug… Just stay right here… right… ? Hey, wait, stop squirming and stay still! Aqua! Quickly! The bindings on my chest…!
Megumin! Just keep him right there and turn him towards me!
… Huh?
Kazuma, did it work? Are you healed?
I think I’ll get healed a lot more if you hug me a little more tightly.
It seems like you are back. Now… H-Hey, if you’re healed, then please let go of me!
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, are you okay? If you’re going to worship a minor goddess like Regina that I’ve never even heard of, it’d be better for you to worship me. If you convert right now, I promise you’ll be able to get better with your handwriting and a whole host of other benefits too.
I don’t need it. In the first place, why do you think I would worship a minor goddess… Hmm?
Hey, what was I worshipping?
Who knows? I don’t really know the details.
Yo. Seems like you’ve regained your senses.
… It’d be a problem to take care of you here.
Then, what about letting me go? We lived together for a time, didn’t we? I think that’ll definitely make the both of us happy.
Seems like you’re conflicted… Say, Kazuma, would you suffer at all if you let me go? If you let me go, I’ll make changes to the plan to attack this town. I really want nothing more to do with a town where you live. Really. … Plus there is that Demon King’s Generals in name only, Wiz, and Vanir living here. If we attack this town, there’s no telling what they would do. I’ll rethink the operation when I make it back to the castle. If you let me go, I won’t ever lay a hand on this town again. What do you think? Let’s strike a proper deal this time.
… Hey, Kazuma, just who is this woman? Is she part of the Demon King’s army? Should I kill her to protect the inhabitants of this town?
… Hey, what is that? Why do you still have that with you?
Sorry Serena, our deal is off. It hurts me too, but since we both broke it, let’s just call it a mutual default.
What are you planning… Hey, Kazuma, don’t do it. Aren’t we friends who’ve lived together for a time? Come on, let me off.
Sorry, I’ll have you redo things from level one together with me.
!?
Gurk!
Uck!? W-What’s this? Hey, Kazuma, when I hit this woman, my stomach…
If you attack her, any damage you do will be mirrored upon you. Whatever you do, don’t kill her. It seems like a death curse will befall a large area around here should she die.
… I see, so that’s why you fell unconscious after you gave her a drop kick that one time.
Ow ow ow! What are you doing!?
Aah… You’re still hiding something, right? Come on, out with it! You can’t fool me that easily!Pant pant… I-It hurts…! Kuu, but I’m not the sort of person who’d give up so easily…!
What are you saying!? Kazuma pretty much knows everything! Ow! Hey, cut it out, there really isn’t anything more I haven’t already told Kazuma! OW! Cut it out! The pain would just go right back to you! Seriously, stop! Stop!
Hey, Kazuma, stop this wom—… W-Wait, stay back! Your level will drop too, you know? Think about it. It’s not like you’d personally benefit if my level drops, right? Seriously, think about it!
Well, I’ll just slowly earn my levels back. I’m pretty close to reaching my stat cap anyway, and I have enough money to live comfortably, so there’s no need to rush… Let’s go all the way to the end with your loyal subordinate, Serena-sama. Come on, let’s start over from zero.
You really are the greatest threat to the Demon King’s army.
You are exaggerating. I’ll be living a laid back life from now on, so if you ever make it back to the castle, please relay that to the Demon King.
You really are too dangerous to be left alone. If you’ve regained your senses, that means I’m back to being the only worshipper of Regina. All my powers must have returned to me. Farewell, my wilful puppet.
Death.
Welcome home, master!
… You seem to be enjoying yourself, Eris-sama.
You’ve gotten used to coming here by now, so if I didn’t do this, you wouldn’t have a sense of novelty, right? Though, sorry, I suppose it’s not really something I should say considering your situation.
… Can you do that one more time?
It’s a little weird to say this since I’m the one who did it first, but I won’t be doing that again.
… S-So what happened to everyone else after she casted Death on me?
Darkness punched her in a fit of fury, so both of them are out of it at the moment. Senpai is working on resurrecting you, and Megumin-san is attending to Darkness after tying up the Demon King’s General… Please be at ease. Everyone’s fine.
Are you alright? … Well, of course you aren’t. You’re dead after all…
Big Boss really is cute, you know? Have you ever considered quitting your work as a goddess and eloping with me to a remote world somewhere?
You’re going out with Megumin-san. You’re going to get divine punishment if you say such things to a goddess while having a partner.
Eris-sama, you’re not pulling any kind of strange strings to make something get in the way whenever Megumin and I are about to cross the line because you harbour secret affections towards me or anything, are you?
Of course not! I wouldn’t do something that stupid! Ah! What’s with that expression? Do you doubt me!?
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san! Everything’s done on my end, so hurry up and come back.
U-Um… Senpai is calling you… I do understand how you feel, but…
… After dying so many times, I can’t help but be depressed. And when I think that I might die again, I just don’t feel like going back anymore. I’m thinking that maybe it isn’t so bad to get reborn into a new life.
That’s… Well, I suppose that’s only natural. Simply dying once is already a pretty big shock… Well, Kazuma-san has died fairly clean deaths so far, so the shock should be quite minimal…
… But, you’ve found wonderful companions in this world and created a quite a few happy memories with them, haven’t you? Don’t you still have things you need to do? There, there, try and remember those happy days…
… I really think I’d like to be reborn again…
Ehh!?
Kazuma-san! Hurry up! Hurry up!
I’ve decided to be reborn! I’ll leave the rest to you! Please tell the other two that I wish them happiness!
Eeh!?
That man is saying stupid stuff again! Stop messing around. Why do you say such stupid things every so often? Do you really like troubling me that much? Are you stupid? Are you really stupid? Is that why you ended up at the beck and call of that priest?!
Ah!
You stop messing around! For whose sake do you think I picked a fight with a Demon King’s General in the first place!? I kept fighting with that priest behind everyone’s backs to protect this town, you know?! I got brainwashed at the end of that intense battle—
Eh, wait, Megumin, what are you doing? Huh?
That won’t work on me anymore! I don’t care what kind of pranks or whatever else you do with my body! Unless you start crying and begging me to come back…
Megumin, what are you doing!? No, wait, what are you doing!? Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san! Hurry up and come back! If you don’t hurry up…!
Kazuma-san! Megumin is…! Megumin is saying something about taking your first time or whatever and is doing something really amazing right now! Actually, Megumin, you really shouldn’t be doing that sort of thing in broad daylight!
Hey, Megumin, I don’t think something that big will fit for Kazuma-san’s first time. Kazuma-san’s Kazuma-san’s will definitely break.
Hey, by first time, you mean that!?
Megumin, you can’t do that! That’s food! You can’t do that sort of things with food! You’ll get punished!
Cut it out! Aqua, I’ll head back right away, so stop her right now!
Aaah! Megumin! Megumin! You can’t do that! He said he’s coming back right now, so hurry up and pull his pants—!
Anyway, Eris-sama, I have some urgent business to take care of, so I’ll take my leave here.
Ah, have a safe trip… Wait, no, Kazuma-san! Sorry to bother you when you’re in a rush, but there’s something important I need to say—
Right now!? We had plenty of time before this, so why did you wait till now to tell me!? Just come see me as Big Boss after I’ve made it back!
Megumin, why do you always do such brash acts!? Come on, he’s coming back soon, so hurry up and get rid of the evidence!
The truth is, that world is—
Megumin, don’t remove it, put it back on! Oh no, we don’t have enough time—!
Sorry, Eris-sama, I really can’t afford to stay right now! Aqua! Stop her! I’ll give you some pocket money later, so stop her!
I mean, there’s a lot of stuff you can’t show to Kazuma…! Ah, Megumin, you can’t! You can’t! Aah!
Don’t give up! Don’t you dare give up, Aqua! I’ll head back right away!
That world is currently facing a crisis! At this rate, it’s highly possible that the Demon King really will end up wiping out humanity! Please listen to me—!
Ah! Welcome back, Kazuma! It really was a close one, wasn’t it?
W-W-Welcome back.
I-I’ll go continue seeing to Darkness, okay?
Hey, Aqua.
What? I stopped her, alright? The two of us looked at your little Kazuma-san, but we didn’t do anything, alright!?
… Say… Do you still want to return to heaven?
Kazuma! Come on, wake up! It’s morning! Hurry up and wake up!
… What time is it…?
It’s just before five.
Why are you crawling back into your bed!? Come on, wake up! Get dressed and we’ll head to the guild to pick up some quests and raise your level!
Spare me~ I was up late drinking last night, so I really want to sleep until evening today… I was celebrating taking down another Demon King’s general yesterday.
Wake up! Wake up! Come on, hurry up and wake up! For the sake of humanity, and for the sake of the future, we’re going after the Demon King!
Some hero chosen by the goddess will take care of the Demon King before long… Anyway, good night…
The goddess is right here, you know!? I choose you as the hero, so hurry up and wake up!
You were the one who sent people like me here without explaining everything. I’m sleeping till the afternoon to protest!
You always sleep till noon anyways! Come on, a goddess is making a request of you! A beautiful goddess is making a tearful request of you, so why don’t you ever listen to me!?
Say, is heaven really that short on manpower? Couldn’t they just grab a goblin from somewhere to do your work?
I won’t let things slide if you keep poking fun at me. I’ll use voice mimicry magic to imitate that strange devil’s voice and laugh for an entire day by your bed.
… We’re talking about the Demon King, you know? There’s no way I can defeat someone like him. Do you really think I look like someone who can defeat the Demon King?
Of course not. Even I’m not that delusional.
Then what do you want? Even if I raise my level and we head off to the Demon King’s castle, if we aren’t taken out by strong monsters on the way, we’d be surrounded by his forces the moment we reach his castle and get taken out. You, Megumin, and Darkness will end up in a really bad way at their hands. The only one who’d be happy with that is Darkness, you know?
Of course I know that. I’ve put some thought into it myself too, you know? All I need you to do is to raise your level enough to bring me close to the castle, that’s all.
Well, if you have a decent plan of some sort, I don’t mind hearing you out.
Listen well. There was a time when we wanted to head straight for the Demon King’s castle, didn’t we? But then they told us that there’s a barrier around the castle. A barrier maintained by his generals.
And you neutralized another General yesterday. A level one General can’t possibly maintain the barrier. That means that the only generals left supporting the barrier are… how many of them are left now?
… There were originally eight of them, right? The first one we encountered was that dullahan Beldia. After that, there’s Vanir, Hans, Sylvia, Wolbach, and now Serena… So, including Wiz, that just leaves two of them.
Yes, there are only two generals left! With my amazing goddess power, I can probably destroy a barrier maintained by only two generals if I put some effort into it! It’d be best if I can take down the barrier entirely, but even if that’s impossible, I should be able to open a hole big enough for someone to go through.
Well, that’s good and all, but how exactly are we going to defeat the Demon King?
Once the barrier is down, the rest is simple! I’d recruit the help of my precious Axis Cult, the Crimson Demons, and the people running this country! We’ll use those connections you forged in this world and tell them that the barrier around the castle is down!
But what happens if you can’t break the barrier entirely?
Then I’ll have to leave it to you.
Tell me more about that.
Using Enemy Detection and Lurk, you can sneak right up to where the Demon King is sleeping and assassinate him.
Screw off.
Hey, Kazuma, can I have a moment?
… What’s wrong? You have a really serious look on your face.
Please listen to me! I really don’t think it’s good for us to remain like this!
What do you mean by that?
This self indulgent lifestyle! Are you really okay with this? Sleeping until noon and doing nothing but eating and sleeping! You’ve changed! You really have changed, Kazuma-san!
This man has pretty much been this way since forever.
Yeah, that’s how he was. Besides, haven’t you been living the same way, Aqua?
Yeah, he might have been the same way before, but I really want the old Kazuma back! The one who was burdened with debts and worked hard every day to earn just a little bit of money!
Right, come at me. I’ll turn you into my experience points.
What’s wrong? You normally laze around just as much as Kazuma, so where did this come from?
The fuss from that priest just got resolved not long ago, so I understand not wanting to go on any quests for a while… Just what brought this on, Aqua?
That’s… well, you know, the duties and responsibilities of an adventurer…
… Or something…
As adventurers, we have a responsibility to the people of the world… Gurk… Waaah!
—What’s up with Aqua?
Don’t worry too much about it. She just got bitten by a strange bug that made her want to defeat the Demon King, that’s all.
Demon King!?
The Demon King, huh? Very well, in order to cement my status as the strongest, let’s go defeat the Demon King. You pretty much defeated Serena on your own, and the battle against the Ninnin was over too quickly. Plus, the victory felt somewhat hollow anyways.
… The Demon King, huh… He must have a really strong attack… Perhaps strong enough to destroy my precious armour in a single blow…
I’ll just say this up front, I’m not heading out to fight him. Don’t misunderstand me just because we happened to take out a few of his Generals. If I have to say, our party is more on the useless side, so… Even if you give me those puppy dog eyes, I’m still not heading out.
—Seriously, what’s up with her?
… Chosen… goddess…
Chosen of the goddess, the legendary…
Chosen of the goddess, the legendary hero Satou Kazuma… The fate of humanity is in your hands… Now, rise up against the Demon King… Grant the wish of the beautiful goddess!
… What are you doing?
… I-I wanted to see Kazuma-san’s cute sleeping face…
Darkness, Megumin, come quick! Aqua came here on a night raid—!
Waaaah! I’m sorry! I was trying to brainwash you!
Hey, Kazuma, please take a look at this.
What do you think of the Demon King? Survey results.
… The title of Demon King sounds kinda cool (Baker). Seems like the sort of person who’d feed stray dragons while keeping it a secret from his underlings (Pet shop owner). Nevermind that, I’d rather you just lend me money (Delinquent). When I told him I’d be leaving the castle to set up a shop, he said it was a good idea and lent me some money (Pale-looking Shopkeeper). Nevermind him, Moi is stronger (Obvious). My god is the Demon King (Tired-looking man).
What the hell is this?
Ahh! That’s not the right one! That’s the one with the answers that shouldn’t be shown to you!
Look at this one! This one holds the opinions of the residents of this town who are suffering and fearful of the Demon King!
I’ll repeat what I said, what the hell is this?
How could you say that!? Kazuma, do you really not feel anything ever after hearing about all the troubles the people in this town face because of the Demon King!? That’s why people are calling you the gigolo NEET of that shameless woman!
H-Hey, I can’t ignore that. Is that the nickname they gave me when I was being puppeted by that woman?
Don’t you feel any shame as an adventurer? Even as you are fooling around with Darkness here, the people the world over are living in fear of the Demon King! Apologize! Apologize for calling yourself an adventurer! Apologize to everyone in the world!
W-We’re not fooling around or anything, I’m just curious what Kazuma is doing with those items!
What are you doing?
Those are the set of forbidden potions that Vanir gave me. This potion causes monsters to attack you for the rest of your life, this one heavily increases your magic power but kills your hair follicles in exchange, this one makes your levels shoot up in exchange for reducing your mana to zero, and there’s this one that attracts the opposite sex but makes you smell like a goblin. I was just thinking if there’s any way to make use of them.
Hey, Kazuma, can you sell me the potion that attracts monsters—
Absolutely not.
Cockadodledooo!
Cocka! Cockadodledooo!
No, Emperor Zell! You shouldn’t make noise right now! That man has been saying a lot of stuff about turning you into dinner as of late! He’ll do it! A man as brutish as Kazuma-san will really do it! So please go back to your quiet and gentle self! Seeing your unruly side is quite beautiful too, but you can’t make such a fuss this early in the morning. We need your power as a dragon to take down the Demon King, so before you grow big enough to fly us all the way to the Demon King’s castle, you need to quietly build up your power.
Cockadodledooo!
No, Emperor Zell, please be quiet!
Oh shut up! What are you doing so early in the morning!? Keep it down already!
Wasn’t he supposed to take a long time to grow up because of his high mana!? When did he suddenly become a rooster!?
Emperor Zell is a lifeform steeped in mystery! He’s a dragon, after all. He must have gotten fired up over fighting the Demon King and awakened to some kind of mysterious power!
What kind of nonsense are you saying!? If you don’t shut that chicken up, I’m going to turn him into dinner!
Emperor Zell, I’ll stop that fiend here, so hurry up and run! Don’t worry about me, just run! Live free and grow strong! Once you’ve fully grown, we’ll go fight the Demon King together! Be careful of the butcher on the third street!
Cocka cock…!
Aah, Emperor Zell! Are you saying you won’t leave me alone? Very well, let’s face down that fiend together! As your mother, I’ll definitely protect you!
I don’t care what you do, just let me sleep in peace. Seriously, I’m begging you.
Then, will you promise not to say stuff like turning him into dinner and such?
Yes, yes, I won’t say that anymore. In exchange, please move his coop to someplace else.
… Still, are you still going on about the Demon King? Just give up on him already. The last General, the Demon King’s daughter, is still hanging around his castle, and so are a whole bunch of elite monsters. Just leave that kind of dangerous stuff to the actually strong people and enjoy our lives here. Don’t worry, someone will definitely take care of it. We should be enjoying our lives now that we have fame and fortune.
This is why Japanese that are used to peace are… Why do you always think of this as someone else’s problem? It’s because of your naive way of thinking that you end up dying more often than a guy playing spelunker.
Right~?
Leave such thoughts back on Earth. Right now, this world is at war. The Demon King’s daughter is about to lead a large army against the capital, right? And there’s still a chance that they will attack this town…
What’s wrong? Why are you opening and closing your mouth like that? Are you imitating a fish now? If it’s some kind of party trick, it doesn’t look impressive at all, you know?
That’s not it! Yes, right, the Demon King! Kazuma, now’s the perfect time to take down the Demon King!
Ah, ah, wait! Don’t go back to sleep, Kazuma-san, please hear me out! If the Demon King’s daughter is leading a large force to attack the capital, that means that the castle is empty! And if they attack this town on top of that…! They have the barrier, so they feel safe sending such a large force out! If we attack them while their armies are out, if we are lucky, there might only be the Demon King in the castle! After all, there’s no need to keep a powerful force in reserve when they have that barrier of theirs, right!? This might be the perfect chance to launch a raid on his castle!
Even if you say that… Ah, I’ve been meaning to ask you, but can healing magic cure baldness?
Leaving aside cases where the hair has been burnt off, that normally wouldn’t work… I’m sorry I can’t help you, Kazuma.
I’m not going bald yet! There’s a potion in that forbidden set that increases your magic in exchange for turning you bald, right!? I was just thinking of drinking that along with the potion that increases your levels in exchange for your magic, that’s all!
There isn’t one.
… Huh? What do you mean?
I gave the potion that increases your levels in exchange for your magic to Emperor Zell. Look at his beautiful body. At this rate, it seems like he will be able to eat the Demon King in a single glup in about ten years, don’t you think?
What!? You used that potion that could’ve been my trump card on him!? Why!? Why are you so stupid!? Why do you always ruin my plans!?
W-What, you don’t have to get that angry! I just thought that if Emperor Zell gained a few levels and grew larger, he’d be able to do something against the Demon King! Come on, look! Don’t you think he looks a lot stronger now?
… Pfft.
—What are the two of you raising such a fuss about so early in the morning? Kazuma, breakfast is ready, so… Y-You look like you’re having fun…
Cut it out! You’ll let mosquitoes in if you break a hole in the window! If you break it, I’ll use your room until the window is fixed! Wind Breath!
Using magic is cheating! If you don’t want your window broken, then help me out with taking out the Demon King!?
Create Water!
So you’re giving the goddess of water a refreshing shower now? Did you forget? I can be completely submerged in water and it wouldn’t do a thing to me. Even if it’s getting cold out, this is but a reward to me—
Create Earth.
Wait, no, stop-
I’ve been waiting for you, Kazuma. Would you mind heading somewhere with me once you’ve finished breakfast? There’s something I need to do, and I would like you to be my witness.
Well, I don’t mind… But witness? That makes it sound like you’re headed off to a duel or something.
But aren’t we friends!? Aren’t we bosom friends!? We just declared an eternal rivalry in the Crimson Demon Village not to long ago, so why did it turn out like this!?
It’s precisely because we are eternal rivals! You were the one who gave me the letter to meet you in the forest because you had something important to talk about! Now come on, bring it!
And here I was wondering what was going on… So Yunyun challenged you to a duel again?
That’s not it! That’s not it at all! It’s not a duel! I just had something to discuss with Megumin!
Then why did you call me out to such a deserted place!? If you had something to discuss, you could just pay me a visit!
Eh!? B-But… If I walked in when you and Kazuma-san were having a good moment, you’ll definitely tell me not to come back… Friendship between women is as flimsy as tissue paper when romance is involved… I read that in a book…
We’ve been interrupted a lot of times by loads of different people by now, so I wouldn’t get angry over just that! Plus, if you really did come in at a bad time, I’d just chase you out for that day, that’s all!
Eh!?
So, anyway, what was the thing you needed to discuss with Megumin?
This is something the Crimson Demon villagers sent…
… The Demon King’s army is marching on the capital in force. All Crimson Demons, in preparation for when the Kingdom calls us to their aid, please gather at the village… Fufu, so the time has finally come when my power is needed. Very well! Yunyun, let’s go show the Demon King’s army what we can…
Umm… They wrote to show the letter to you too, so…
… Oh, so Yunyun is in charge of the first squad. As expected of the future chief. Now, Megumin is… She’s at the corner of the second squad. Substitute is written next to her name…
Megumin can’t use advanced magic, so that’s probably why she’s benched-Aaah!
What are you doing!? I still have to show that letter to the other Crimson Demons!
Who cares about that. More importantly, what are you going to do? You just came back to Axel recently, so are you heading back to the village again?
Seriously, you’re going to be the next chief, so why are you still so hesitant!? If you have something to say, just say it!
Ow ow ow! I got it! I’ll say it, so please stop pulling on my hair! … U-Um… I’ve heard that minions of the Demon King will be coming to this town too… I’ve made a few f-frien… acquaintances in this town recently…
The people back home are calling you back to the village, but you have friends in this town too, so you want to stay and protect the people of the town, right?
Eh! A-Ah, yes… Friends… I’ve made a few friends in this town…
But a gathering of the entire village is not something that happens often. As the future chief of the Crimson Demons, I can’t possibly ignore the summons when the village calls for a gathering…
Hey, Megumin, what are you—
Explosion!
Ah! What are you doing, Megumin!? There are still people I haven’t shown that letter to! What should I do!? What should I…
Did you see that, Kazuma? This is the true power of a Crimson Demon that is worthy of being placed in the first squad!
W-What should I do!? Really, what should I do now!? Why do you always keep causing trouble for me!?
Oh, stop panicking, you spineless girl! Just say the delivery man got captured by orcs on the way or the letter got eaten by your pet Goat Devil or something! You want to protect this town, right? Rather than spending time thinking about such useless stuff, you really should be bolder!
You just don’t want her to go back just because you aren’t happy with how you’re treated, right?
Wha—!
…nii-chan…chan…wake…
Onii-chan, wake up! You’ll be late! Come on, wake up!
Good morning, Onii-chan! Now, let’s go take down that Demon King like we always do!
Get off!!
Oniiii-chan!!
… Today’s awakening was kinda nice.
I knew it. Using ‘Onii-chan’ on the lolicon Kazuma really does work best.
Hey, Kazuma, isn’t it about time you give in already? You might whine and grumble, but you’re the kind of person who always pulls through in the end whenever one of us is in trouble, right?
Do you think I’m some kind of blue cat robot who can do anything? In the first place, you are the actual goddess here, so shouldn’t you be the one to resolve such issues?
The only things I can do are purifying water, dealing with undead and devils, and resurrecting people. Goddesses aren’t exactly that great of an existence, you know?
So you finally admit it. Can’t you seal away the Demon King or something? Sealing evil existences away is what goddesses are supposed to do, right?
The only sort of evil I can seal away right now are the kind coming from your pants.
D-Don’t stare at it… I can’t help it, it’s morning! Anyway, nevermind that.
Right now, it isn’t a guarantee that you would be able to bring down the barrier, right? But if another General would be taken out, you’d definitely be able to bring it down, so let’s wait until then, alright?
The last General is the Demon King’s daughter, right? I don’t know how strong she is, but it’s hard to imagine her coming out without a scratch after attacking the capital. The capital is swarming with those cheat holders, and above all, there’s my sister, the strongest in the world, at the capital as well. Once the attack on the capital fails, I’ll ask the people at the top to send a strong escort with me to take down the barrier. If they fail, well, we can think of another plan when that happens.
General… If there’s only one general left…
Hey, what exactly—
Yeah, if there’s only one general left, I’ll definitely be able to take down the barrier! Once the barrier is down, someone will eventually take the Demon King out! Yeah, definitely!
I’m heading out for a bit!
Hey, no, wait! Wait a minute!
Wiz! Where are you!? Stop hiding and come out already!
Are you deaf? Moi has already told you that the slacking shopkeeper isn’t here! That shopkeeper orders a whole bunch of useless stuff the moment you take your eyes off her, so Moi is also—… Hey! Remove your hands from my mask!
Graaaa-Welcome! Handler, do reign in your rabid hound of a goddess!
Don’t call me a handler. Is Wiz out? Actually, this makes it really hard to talk, so cut it out.
Hey, strange devil, if those powers of yours aren’t a scam, hurry up and use them to determine Wiz’s current location.
Hmph. Don’t lump my powers together with that of the goddesses who claim omnipotence but are in fact unable to accomplish anything at all. Besides, Moi has already told you, the more power a person has, the harder it is for me to see through them. That defective shopkeeper has no talent for business, but the one thing she does have is power.
You talk a big game, but at the end of the day, you just don’t know, do you? You really are completely useless whenever it’s important. This is a little weird coming from me, but doesn’t that make you even worse than me?
… Very well, it has been some time, but perhaps it’s time for me to get serious. It’s best that you leave the store. Moi shall settle the score with those irritating gods today.
Ah, Kazuma-san, Aqua-sama. Welcome. You came in at just the right time. I just got my hands on an interesting item…!
So… What did you buy?
I’m glad you asked!
… A teru teru bozu?
What’s a teru teru bozu? This is a powerful magic item that can control the weather. Simply hang it at the front of your house and they will forcibly clear up the weather! Normally, controlling the weather requires a long ritual and the use of many rare components, but that can be done with just this item! What do you think? Isn’t it amazing!? It’s amazing, isn’t it?
… So, does that thing has any side effects? Like using it will cause it to not rain for ten years… Or it requires a large amount of mana…
There aren’t any side effects. I’ve learnt after getting lectured by Vanir-san so many times! To use it, all a person needs to do is pour a reasonable amount of mana into it and hang it by the eaves of your house. And it can only be used during a specific season, so there aren’t any downsides at all! What do you think? Isn’t it an amazing item?
And what exactly is the season that you can use these things?
It’s right now! It can only be used during this season! I’m not foolish enough to buy something that couldn’t be used. You really are a worrywart, Vanir-san.
… Dear customer, do come here for a moment.
… I’ll just say this up front, I won’t buy it.
Don’t say that. Moi can definitely feel strong magic coming from this piece of— this wonderful product. Its capabilities are definitely the real deal.
… I don’t recall it ever raining recently. Does it even rain around these parts in this season?
… There was a day when it rained around this season twenty years ago.
I won’t buy it.
Don’t say that. This world is very large. There might be a place in the world that’s troubled by extreme rains around this season. If you bring it into such a region, it shall definitely be treated as a prized treasure. If you buy it now, Moi will even throw in the forbidden potion set: number two as a free gift.
I won’t buy it. Besides, Aqua can make a similar item on her own. She made a Teru Teru Megumin or something a while back.
On top of that, Moi shall throw in a pre-release product that Moi has been developing in secret, the life size body pillow of the erotic shopkeeper.
I won’t… Tell me more details.
Um… Is something the matter, Aqua-sama?
—Come to think of it, it’s been over a year since we met, hasn’t it? How ironic… I’m a goddess and you’re a lich. Normally, the two of us could never have such a cordial relationship.
Has it already been that long? … Ah, I bought some cookies along with that magic item. Would you like some, Aqua-sama?
I’ll have some… No, that’s not it. Say, Wiz, we’ve become way too close to each other. Normally, it would only be natural for me to purify you the moment we met. Yes, a god and an undead. Those are two entities that should never get along this cordially…!
There’s a really dangerous aura around you for some reason, Goddess of Violence. Moi doesn’t know what happened, but if you intend to go wild here, Moi will be forced to bill you a tremendous amount for the damages. If you’re prepared for that, then feel free to go ahead.
Wiz… Please understand! We can’t protect this world without defeating you! It pains me to hurt a friend, but, please, Wiz, I want to return to heaven! I’ll make it quick, so please go back to the earth!
… If I return to the earth, will Aqua-sama be able to go back to heaven?
Yes, exactly! It’s a pity, Wiz, but there are reasons why I can’t let you off! I don’t mind if you hold a grudge against me, but, as a goddess—
Very well.
As a goddess…! … It’s fine? No, wait, Wiz, you can’t give up on life so easily! What do you think your life is? You’ll get punished, you know?
If you purify me, you’ll be able to go back to heaven, yes? I don’t understand the details, but something must have cropped up, right? After spending so much time together, I know very well that Aqua-sama is a benevolent and kind person… If that Aqua-sama wants to purify me, I’ll go along with it.
What are you saying, Wiz? Have you forgotten the promise you made with me!? You really are gutsy if you think you can break a contract with a devil! If you go back into the earth, who will create my dungeon for me!? Everything I’ve done for this shop is in service of that goal!
Vanir-san, you actually called me by my name. I’m sorry I couldn’t keep my promise… Um, he’s asleep in a mansion deep in the forest right now, but I do know another lich. I’ll introduce you to him, so please make do…
Normally, it would’ve been natural for you to purify me the moment we met. Thank you for letting me off until now, Aqua-sama. Thanks to that, I was able to manage this shop together with Vanir-san and get to know a lot of other people. I’ve lived a long time, but this past year has been the most enjoyable year of my life. That’s no exaggeration. So nevermind holding a grudge, I should be grateful to you.
I originally set up this shop to be a place where my old adventuring companions could come back to. But, just the other day… Yeah, it was back when Vanir and I were talking about our past and Aqua-sama fell asleep. I managed to tell my companions, ‘Welcome home,’ when they came to visit on that day… So I have no regrets.
U…uuuu…
Aqua-sama, I will have to be purified by someone someday, or I’ll be around forever. If I have to be purified by someone, I would choose to be purified by Aqua-sama. It’d help you, after all. Plus…
I enjoyed being your friend, Aqua-sama
U…uuu… Waaaaaah!
Say, did Aqua come back?
Aqua? She came rushing back in not too long ago and shut herself in her room. I told her dinner’s ready, but she didn’t come out at all. Just what happened?
It’s, well… Just give me Aqua’s portion of dinner. I’ll bring it up to her.
—Hey, I understand how you feel, but don’t just go home without me. Megumin made dinner, so open up.
… Leave me alone. I just lost a little bit of my confidence as a goddess right now.
Say… Isn’t it fine to put the Demon King out of your head for a while? Is there really a need to rush back to heaven right now?
… You know that you won’t be able to see Wiz again if you go back to heaven, right?
… I brought the dinner Megumin made up with me. If you don’t want it, I’ll take it down.
… Just leave the food here.
—What’s wrong with Aqua? She’s usually the first one at the table. Does her stomach hurt?
Don’t worry. She seems like she’s willing to eat the food I brought up. Give her some time. She’ll definitely come back down once she gets hungry again.
Are you really fine with being separated from us?
AAAAAAAH!
Do you really want to go back after staying here for so long?
… What are you doing over there? You couldn’t sleep?
… Well, I slept a little too much this afternoon… Anyway, what are you doing here? You’re going to end up feeding the mosquitoes, you know?
You really are as trashy as usual, aren’t you?
The only thing you have on your mind is food, so what are you doing out here moongazing? Is heaven on the moon? Are you guys like Princess Kaguya or something?
Of course not, I’m just looking at it because it’s pretty. You know, I’ve been wondering about this for quite some time, but what exactly do you think I am? Even I have times where I want to admire something beautiful, you know? What do you think? Isn’t a goddess looking up at the moon absolutely picturesque?
… Say, do you really want to go back to heaven so badly? You’ve been here for over a year now, right? You’ve gotten to know a lot of people, so don’t you ever think that it might be lonely not being able to see them again?
It’s only been just over a year, hasn’t it? It feels really strange. I’ve known the other gods and angels in heaven for far longer, but life on this world is, how do you put it, stormy and full of drama?
You’ve been in heaven for far longer? That means you really are an old—
If you say anything more, I’ll put a seal on your lower body such that it will never stand up straight again.
In heaven, every day is the same. It doesn’t change the slightest from day to day. To be honest, it’s quite boring… Well, on the flip side, it does mean that I don’t end up with any unpleasant memories.
Ever since then, I’ve gotten several apologies from the adventurers. Though, as a goddess, I wasn’t really affect by those acts.
… I want to go home.
… Well, you know, I’ve been putting a little bit, just a little bit, of thought into how to take down the Demon King too… But just so you know, I’m not about to head off right now to take him down or anything, alright? For example, I could buy a large amount of explosive potions from Wiz and create a large amount of explosives with them. Then we could bury them around the Demon King’s castle like landmines and starve them out. Alternatively, I could have Yunyun register a teleport point right in front of the Demon King’s castle, and launch an explosion against it every day…
… Heheheh. You were so against this earlier, but you’ve finally started! See, I told you. Kazuma-san always finds a way to deal with it in the end… But, it’s fine. You were originally pretty weak to begin with, but if you take an attack from the Demon King at your level, it’s possible that there might not even be enough of your body left to perform a resurrection.
The reason I’m weak is because I got you in place of a cheat. If I’m weak, that’s because you weren’t pulling your weight, so those words apply to you too. Do you understand, you useless goddess-sama?
Hey, I want to put a seal on you, so come a little closer, will you?
I’m sorry.
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san.
… What is it?
Satou Kazuma-san. Are you glad that you’ve come to this world? Have you ever regretted it?
I don’t regret a thing. I’m glad to have come here.
Oh?
That’s good then… Good night. Don’t do anything strange back in your room just because you were captivated by my beauty in the moonlight, okay? You’ll get divine punishment if you do that.
That’s utterly impossible.
Maybe I really should put a little seal on him…
Hey! Kazuma! Kazuma! Wake up! Wake up already!
I can’t eat another bite…
H-Hey! You’re awake, aren’t you!? Aah, wa-wait!
… What are you doing? … I just asked you to wake Kazuma up! Seriously, the moment I take my eyes off you, you’re back to seducing him! You really are a slut!
Ah, n-n-no, that’s not! I haven’t done—!
… Did you come to attack me again!?
Aah! Y-You little—!
What’s the matter, you two? Why are you raising such a fuss so early in the morning?
It’s already noon! More importantly, this is really serious! Please read this!
Ah!
I understand how you feel, but please read it all the way to the end.
… Are there really ten billion Axis Cultists in this world?
… There’d probably be about a few hundred at best.
That idiot…!
… Aqua has been saving up the allowance you’ve been giving her. She should’ve saved up quite a sum by now, so she might be trying to hire a few skilled adventurers right now…
PS: Please come after me.
Please don’t come after me
I’m supposed to use the utensils starting from the furthermost ones, right?
Kazuma, how many years has it been since you heard about that? Nobles are extremely sensitive to changes in trends. Right now, you should start with the innermost ones.
I see. It’s a different country with its own culture, so it’s only natural for table etiquette to be different too. But I know about this one. This is called the finger-bowl, right? It’s meant for washing your fingertips.
That’s meant for washing your face. This is a restaurant directed towards serving nobles, you know? Both parties wash their faces with it before eating. It’s meant to signify that neither party has any ulterior motives as they dine with each other without wearing any sort of makeup.
… You’re kidding, right? I mean, there’s no towel, so wouldn’t your face be left dripping?
What do you think that napkin is for? Why did you put it on your lap in the first place?
Today’s just practice, so it’s fine, but make sure you properly memorize the etiquette for tomorrow. Otherwise you’d embarrass me. Right, so first, let’s start with the soup…
A noble lady, huh… I’m sure she’s a girl who couldn’t lift anything heavier than a pair of chopsticks, fawns all over a small animal the moment she lays her eyes on one, and speaks to the flowers in the gardens…
Anyone who fits that description perfectly would be a very strange person. Just what do you think noble ladies are? The nobles might appear gentle on the surface, but each and every one of them have hearts as black as coal.
Cut it out! This is a dinner that might restore the image of noble ladies in my mind after you have brought them so low. At least let me get excited about it before we meet.
Why don’t you explain to me exactly why your image of noble ladies have been brought down by me?
Noble lady sure does have a nice ring to it. Haa… All the nobles I’ve met with so far have all been full of weird quirks, so I shouldn’t get my hopes up, but it’d be nice if it was a gentle ojou-sama…
… Say, Kazuma, it’s fine to look forward to it and all, but do you know the etiquette for dealing with nobles? Nobles are very sensitive to trends, you know? Are you familiar with the latest ones?
So you are Satou-sama, yes? I’ve heard many great things about you… I’m glad to finally meet you in person. I hope we can have an enjoyable conversation today.
I’m honoured to be in your presence. If you wish, I’d be happy to converse with you.
Now, pardon me—
Eh?
… A-As expected of an adventurer, you sure are quite wild… Ah, the soup is here. The soup of this restaurant is very rich…
You lied to me, didn’t you! Don’t you dare laugh!
Do you have any idea how much I was looking forward to this? She’s a noble lady, you know? A proper Ojou-sama! How could you ruin it…!
Yes, yes, I’m sorry. Still, you should be a little thankful to me. That lady really does have an ulterior motive. Her family enjoys opulence and spends gold like water, and is rumoured to be on the verge of bankruptcy. Just as those rumours started to spread, she suddenly wanted to meet with you. Still…Pfft.
How long are you going to laugh!? I know that girl was only getting close to me because of my fortune, but you still shouldn’t have have toyed with me like that! I even missed out on eating that restaurant’s dishes…
Pfft… Sorry, but her family does have quite a bit of pull. I couldn’t refuse her request without a good reason. I’ll buy some high-quality ingredients and cook you a meal once we get back as an apology.
And afterwards… Well, we can have a meal together. I’m a noble lady too, you know? Can you forgive me with that?
… I really want a magic sword.
How to Prepare Beef and Potato Stew for Dummies
Isn’t your Chunchunmaru a pretty rare sword already? What part of it is unsatisfactory?
There’s the name, for one.
It’s a little boastful for me to be saying this, but there aren’t that many swords that have such a cool name, you know? I’ve said this before, but your naming sense is really strange.
I never dreamed that there’d come the day where you’d be criticizing my naming sense…
Still, a magic sword, huh? I do understand why you might want something like that. It’d be hard to take down the Demon King without a powerful magic weapon, after all.
I’m not doing this for such a grand purpose, so stop it.
… Oh, very well. Let’s go get a magic sword, then.
See, there’s a magic sword.
I want to say it’s been some time, but what’s going on now?
Say, Megumin, if I take away the magic sword from the Magic Sword Guy, wouldn’t he just become a regular guy?
True, that magic sword really is that guy’s only unique point…
Hey, wait, even I do have plenty of other memorable traits! And would you please call me by name!?
You’ll bother the other people if you shout like that, Magic Sword Guy. Anyway, Kazuma here wants a magic sword. If I recall, you have a powerful sword called Gram, right?
Why is it that you can remember my sword’s name but not mine!?
Megumin, Gram is a magic sword that only he can make use of. I don’t think I’d be able to make proper use of it.
Is that so? I really think it’s a waste for the Magic Sword Guy to have such a powerful weapon when he can’t even manage to take down a single Demon King’s General…
A-A waste… Hey, wait, even I managed to take down a few high bounty targets.
… Well, it can’t be helped in that case. Let’s head over to our next stop, then.
Listen to me!
Welcome, dear customers who are looking for a magic sword. Moi stocks various magic weapons in this store, so feel free to pick one you like.
Ah, yeah, if you want a magic sword, a magic item store is of course a good place to stop at.
Kazuma, look at this. From what I can tell, this is a very powerful magic item! Moreover, this thing feels really compatible with me!
Hou? As expected of a Crimson Demon, your eye when it comes to magic items is sharp indeed. That’s a rare magic sword that will explode when you pour mana into it.
I’m not buying that.
Use your powers to help me find a magic sword that I can use and isn’t trash.
Leave it to me, dear customer! Fuhahahahaha! Behold, my powers of foresight…!
… … Brat, magic swords tend to choose their own wielders…
Don’t say anything more! You’re just going to say that there isn’t a magic sword that I can use, right!?
Isn’t this a cooking knife?
This is the magic item, ‘Fish Slayer’. It’s is enchanted to be more damaging against aquatic creatures. Moi heartily recommends this item.
You bastard, are you telling to pick a fight with a strong enemy armed with a cooking knife!? I’m not going into battle with a cooking knife! … But it looks quite cool, so I’ll buy it anyway!
Kazuma, Kazuma, we’ve known each other for quite some time, haven’t we?
… So, who do you need to apologize to this time?
Wait a minute, why do you immediately think I’ve done something wrong?
The only reasons why you would call me by my name like this is because you got into some kind of trouble, are completely bored, or want some more pocket money from me.
Tsk, I don’t like this, but I can’t find a way to retort… But just listen to me this time. You’ll definitely be overjoyed to the point where you’ll willingly give me more pocket money.
Didn’t I already give you some yesterday?
It’s already all gone. I don’t get it. My purse was full yesterday morning, but it’s now completely empty after I spent a night out drinking.
It’s over here! Over here! What you swiped at just now was just an afterimage… Oh, to think you saw through my feint. You’re quite something indeed…
Kazuma, please listen to me! I’m begging you! The guy at the store was selling something really amazing today! I could tell at a glance! You’ll definitely be happy with it too!
Just what kind of amazing item is it? I’ve come across plenty of amazing stuff since I’ve come to this place, so I’m pretty much used to such things by this point.
Fufu, seems like you’ve slowly gotten to know the world of art. Why don’t you stop becoming a useless adventurer and start working towards becoming an art connoisseur from now on?
Just who exactly are you calling useless?
Is there some sort of special occasion today?
This is why NEETs are hopeless. There’s a holiday today. Everyone in town is throwing a festival, that’s why it’s so rowdy. See, look at how cheerful everyone is.
So, what holiday is it?
I think it is the birthday of the princess of this country.
Hey, isn’t that Iris? This is bad, I haven’t prepared a birthday gift for her!
What are you saying? Just where do you think we are heading to right now, Kazuma?
That shop that sells that really amazing item! Aqua, you aren’t totally useless after all!
Hey, hold on, haven’t I been really useful as of late!?
… What exactly is this?
It’s just as you see, Kazuma. This is a store that sells rocks. These rocks have been gathered from the four corners of the world by the storekeeper.
Did you get conned again!? These rocks all look like they were picked up from the local riverbed!
It’s only expected for someone with no eye for art like you to say such things, but you’re just asking to get chewed out if you continue. Say, storekeep, why don’t you show this man just how amazing this rock is?
This is why amateurs are… Take a good look at this rock from this angle.
Winter Shogun? Hey, isn’t this the Winter Shogun?
Yes, indeed. Isn’t it amazing? To think that a naturally weathered stone could form such an image…
… No, no, wait, wait, it’s amazing and all, but what use could I have for such an item? In the first place, I’m here to pick up a present for Iris—
What are you saying? A girl brimming with curiosity like her would be sure to be amazed with such a gift. She would’ve gotten tired of receiving precious jewels and ornate treasures by now.
Excuse me, I’d like to buy this pebble.
Sure thing. That’d be eight thousand eris.
Hey, wait a minute, I wanted that pebble.
Aren’t you broke? Besides, rather than something expensive, Iris would probably be happier with some oddity or a handcrafted piece of art. Even if it’s cheap, as long as it comes from the heart, she’d surely be happy with it, so—
I was the one who saw it first! Please, Kazuma, I can let you have the Winter Shogun, but please at least buy this piece for me!
That’d be twenty thousand eris.
Please, I really like this piece! I’ll take good care of it! See, from this angle, it looks a little like Chomusuke.
Seriously… Oh, fine, I’ll buy it for you.
Thank you, Kazuma!
I’ll probably forget about this in an hour, so I wanted to thank you before I forget.
Give that rock back to me, I’m going to go get a refund.
Allow us to get to the main issue. As many of you may have already suspected, the reason we gathered all you adventurers here today is because of the rumours that the Demon King’s army is planning a sneak attack on this town.
Do we know exactly when they will be attacking? What about their numbers? Actually, if we already know that they are coming, can’t we just ask the capital to send a few knights down?
According to the general we captured the other day, they originally intended to infiltrate the town and attack from the inside, so the amount of forces they had prepared was quite small. But, now that we have captured the commander, they would most likely try and get her back. That means they will probably attack with a larger force.
We don’t know the exact numbers, but given that this town is mostly filled with fledgling adventurers, it’s expected to be a pretty tough fight. As for seeking aid from the capital… It seems like the Demon King’s army is intending to launch a full-scale attack on the capital concurrently…
So, to be perfectly frank, it’s best not to hold much hope for reinforcements. After all, it’ll all be over if the capital falls. The other guilds in the area have already been informed of the attack and are currently sending over skilled adventurers and soldiers to the capital. We can only rely on ourselves to defend this town…
Satou… Satou Kazuma. I don’t see Aqua-sama anywhere. Where is she?
… ? Oh, Yamazaki. Long time no see.
It’s Mitsurugi! Hurry up and remember my name already! That doesn’t even sound remotely close! You’re not doing this on purpose, are you!? … No, nevermind. More importantly, what happened to Aqua-sama? Is she not with you today?
Aqua left behind a letter before running away from home. Actually, what are you doing here? Weren’t you covering yourself in glory in the capital? Is it really fine to leave the capital during such a crisis?
I heard Axel is in danger, so I came here to provide support. This is the place Aqua-sama chose to call home, after all… Still, she ran away? So Aqua-sama finally got sick of you, huh? Anyway, where is she right now?
That’s what I would like to know. She wrote that she’s heading off to take down the Demon King before slipping off into the night. If she caught the midnight carriage, she’ll probably be close to Alcanretia right now. With the number of Demon King’s generals reduced severely, she feels like she can break through the barrier right now, or so she says.
Take down the Demon King!!?
Alone!? Aqua-sama went off to take on the Demon King by herself!? Then what are you doing hanging around here!?
Even if you say that, I just discovered she was missing a short while ago! Then there was an announcement, so I found myself here!
Aqua left on a journey alone!? Come on, that’s way too reckless.
How could she think of going out alone!? And at night too!? She’d be swarmed with undead in no time!
Aqua-san is famous for not having any survival skills. She still occasionally gets lost in this town even after having lived here for so long. There’s no way she is going to make it to the Demon King’s Castle!
Calm down! Everyone, please calm down! … Has anyone here seen Aqua-san today?
I-I can’t linger around here! I’m heading off after Aqua-sama! Satou Kazuma, what do you intend to do!? You’re going after her, right!? Want to come along with me!?
T-That would be a problem! There’s a pressing need for high leveled adventurers like you to assist in the defence of the capital or this town…! I’ll send out an urgent notice to the other guilds to search for Aqua-san, so…!
Hey, if he wants to go, then just let him!
We can handle the defence of this town with just the people here. Nee-chan, you might not be aware of this, but there are plenty of high level adventurers in this town. There’s no need to beg this brat who is constantly surrounded by two women for help, just rely on us!
Even if you say that… ! How many adventurers do we have that are above level 20? I reckon most of the adventurers here have levels between ten and the low twenties at best. By convention, most adventurers would leave this town after hitting level 20 and move on to other towns surrounded by stronger monsters. We’d be very lucky just to have a handful of people here above level 20… 
I’m level thirty two.
… Eh?
Umm… I’m level thirty eight…
Eh?
… W-Why are all of you staying in this town even after achieving such a high level!? The monsters around here don’t provide a lot of experience points…
Isn’t it obvious? That’s because we love this town.
E-Everyone… ! Let’s protect this town! We can do it! With this many strong adventurers together, we’ll definitely be able to protect this town! Let’s give it our all! Please lend me your strength and protect this town…!
Here. That’s where the Demon King’s castle is located.
As you can see, the fastest way to get to the Demon King’s castle is to teleport to the capital and hoof it to the castle. There are several fortified towns and fortresses along the path, much like the one you visited not too long ago, from which a traveller can replenish their supplies.
… Would Aqua really take the simplest route to her destination? I feel like she’ll definitely go off on a weird detour that only makes sense to her… In any case, I genuinely doubt she’d choose such a straightforward course.. It’s possible that she might still be nearby, debating if she really wants to set off or not.
It’s a little out of the way, but you can make it to the Demon King’s castle from Alcanretia too.
It’s her we are talking about, so she’ll probably include some really high requirements in her recruitment notices, just like when we first started searching for companions in this town…
advanced classes only
It really brings back memories, doesn’t it? Back then, I used up all the money I had and hadn’t eaten for many days before I happened to chance upon the recruitment notice…
And I resolved to join this party after seeing Megumin and Aqua covered in the frog’s slimey internal fluids. Seeing Aqua wailing while covered in slime and Megumin hanging, limp and lifeless, onto Kazuma made me think that maybe even someone as clumsy as me could also… Ah! Cut it out, Megumin! That’s the truth, isn’t it!?
I think this is the most likely path that Aqua would take. She would most likely stick to places she is already familiar with, so, instead of going to the capital, she’ll take the carriage to Alcanretia and try to recruit companions there. But this is Aqua we are talking about. She’ll probably put in some really high requirements and end up getting nobody. Afterwards, out of options and too afraid to continue traveling on her own, she’ll most likely go crying to the Axis Cult for help.
… Yeah, that sounds like her.
I can absolutely picture her doing that.
N-No, wait a minute. Just what kind of person do you think Aqua-sama is?
You probably have a lot of questions, but this is most likely the route she’s planning to take. We didn’t spend so long together without getting to know her. She might have a considerable head start on us, but she’ll definitely get into all kinds of trouble along the way and be held up as a result, so we’ll definitely catch up with her even if we set off now.
… Well, if you say so… It’s almost noon now. If we hurry, we’ll be able to board the sightseeing carriage that runs from here to Alcanretia. It’s a little slow, but if we offer the driver some money to pick up the pace, we should be able to catch up to Aqua-sama. Right, then…
Now, then, everyone, we’ll start dividing you into groups! Everyone who’s already part of a party, please gather together. I’ll be giving every party a number and role…
Hey, what are you doing? This isn’t your place.
Umm… I-I’m sorry…
Where are you going? Your place is over there, isn’t it?
… … ?
In terms of combat prowess, you’re probably ranked first or second in this town, right? If a true Crimson Demon like you were to join forces with that irksome magic sword wielder, you might actually be able to face down the Demon King, don’t you think? Go hunt down that damned annoying Demon King and give him a good few blows in our place.
Hey, if Yunyun is a true Crimson Demon, what does that make me? Why don’t you make it clear right now?
I’m a little worried just leaving these guys on their own. If it was just to get Aqua-neechan back, it’ll be fine, but it’s these guys we are talking about. They might end up getting dragged into fighting yet another troublesome enemy. It’d be safer to have a real Archwizard like you with them… Come now, you can cast Teleport, can’t you? If push comes to shove, you can just teleport back here on your own, no problem.
Hey, why don’t you tell me exactly what kind of Archwizard I am if not a real one!?
– I understand. I’ll be off to help Aqua-san! I-It’s only natural to help a f-friend in need…
Crimson Demons are a race that will never back down from a fight. Very well, I’ll take you on. Let’s take this outside!
Seems like it’s decided, then. Now… Yunyun, was it? Shall we head off? Having an Archwizard on the team is certainly comforting. It doesn’t seem like you have a party yet, so, if you want, I’ll be happy to have you in our party after everything’s done.
Umm… T-That’s… I’m fine.
I-It’s fine, Kyouya! You have us, don’t you!?
Y-Yeah! Sure, it might be good for the party balance to have her join us, but she seems to be a fairly famous mage in town…! So, um, well, this can’t be helped!
Dust-kun! Dust-kun! Look, the handsome hunk got rejected! He even extended his hand like he’s hitting on her! Seems like even hunks can get rejected!
Gyahahaha! Even the legendary loner knows how to pick her friends!
T-That’s not it…! I-If I join up, I’ll just create trouble for…! T-T-That’s not it…! Dust-san, Kazuma-san! Please cut it out!
A-Annoying! Those two are really annoying! Kyouya, there’s no need to pay any heed to what people as lonely seeming as them say!
Hey, delinquent, go over there! Shoo, shoo!
N-now then, we should get moving… The ones who will be going after Aqua-sama would be me, my two companions, and the four of you lead by Satou, right… However, I feel like this journey presents a great opportunity. If the Demon King’s army intends to attack both this town and the capital at the same time, the defence of the castle would be lowered to its weakest state. If Aqua-sama were to break through the barrier that they are relying on… What do you think? I think it’ll work.
Sorry, but I have no intention of heading out after Aqua. The reason I originally came here in the first place is to put out a request for a few high level adventurers to go after her. After all, my current level is one.
L-Level one? How could this have happened? You were quite weak in the first place. That means…
Hey, you lost to the ‘quite weak’ me multiple times, so you don’t get to say that!
No, more importantly, Satou Kazuma! Do you seriously intend to leave the fate of Aqua-sama in the hands of others!? Even after being together for so long!? Are you really… Wait, hold on, how many times did you say I lost to you? The only occasion I lost to you was the time you stole my magic sword from me…
Kazuma, are you really not going to go after Aqua? If it’s about your level, I’m pretty sure you can raise a few levels on the journey…
I really want to go after her, but right now even a single goblin is a major threat to me. You’re high leveled, and Darkness is tough, so you two will be fine, but all I’ll do is slow you down.
No, I’ll properly protect you, so, Kazuma…
Aqua isn’t around right now. In other words, if I slip up and die, I won’t be able to get revived. If you really think that you ever made me feel at ease during any of our previous adventures, then please, do tell me.
… You know, I really hate the heroine character that occasionally appears in manga and anime who shoots off on her own due to a strong sense of justice or whatever, only to end up getting taken captive. If the only thing I can do is get in the way, I think it’s best for everyone to leave it in the hands of someone capable instead.
… I see. Very well. You don’t have a divine relic or any special powers, so as you are right now, you’re simply a normal high schooler. I won’t force someone like you to go on such a grueling journey. In your place, I’ll catch up with Aqua-sama, then head on to defeat the Demon King. Is that okay?
If you are really capable of defeating him, I don’t mind, but just so you know, that’s a death flag.
Though, as you’ve said earlier, if Aqua and Yunyun were to join your party, I feel like you’d stand a pretty good chance against the Demon King. In terms of party balance, it’s the perfect composition.
Megumin, Darkness, I’ll just get in the way if I tag along, but you two are pretty strong, so go with Mitsurugi after Aqua. I’ll watch the house.
… No, I will stay here. I know I’m not exactly easy to work around. Without Kazuma’s directions, I’ll definitely blow my load on the first monster that jumps out at us and end up being luggage. I’ll await her return here with you.
… In that case, I’ll remain here too. A Crusader’s main role is to defend others, after all. Defending Axel would most likely be a better use of my talents. Plus…
… W-What?
… No, it’s nothing.
I’m home~
Oh, no, I’m not letting you out to play. There are some really dangerous vegetables growing in the yard right now. You’ll have to play inside the house until it’s time to harvest them.
… Hmm? What’s the matter?
A-Ah, no, it’s nothing. It’s just, I’m used to hearing Aqua say ‘Welcome back’ every time we come back home…
Oh, there’s a letter addressed to Kazuma here.
Oh, it’s a letter from my sister!
It’s a letter from Iris-sama! Show some respect!
Say, Iris isn’t going to fight, is she? In such a situation, the princess would be snuck out of the city in order to preserve the royal bloodline, right?
Under normal circumstances, yes… but even amongst the royal family, the blood of heroes flows especially strongly in the veins of Iris-sama. If this country, the defense line against the forces of the Demon King, were to fall, it could mean the end of humanity. In such a case, she might end up taking the field as humanity’s trump card…
That girl will be fine. After all, she’s my follower and my left hand. She’ll definitely send the Demon King’s daughter back home in tears.
H-Hey, if you keep treating Iris-sama like she’s below you, someone might really take your head off.
This guy is grabbing his head and muttering to himself. Should we do something?
He’s probably having a mental crisis after hearing that the young Iris-sama might have to be sent out into battle too… Right.
Say, Kazuma, if you don’t have any plans, why don’t you come with us for a change a pace? I want to try going back to our roots and challenging what could be said to be our arch nemesis.
I told you I’m level one, didn’t I!? One slip and I’m dead! Darkness! Darkness! Hurry up and do something about that frog!
No, wait, Darkness, please do something about this first! It’s already up to my neck! This is the furthest I’ve ever been swallowed!
You are already useless, so just stand by! If I get swallowed, I won’t be able to hold out until this clumsy fool is able to land an attack!
You can only say that because you haven’t been swallowed enough! Being swallowed is the most primal form of fear that exists in any living creature!
You were the one who said it was warm and comfy inside a frog’s mouth back when you got swallowed in the winter!
Kazuma, I can’t do anything while the frog is moving like that, so just stay still for a moment! Don’t worry, trust me!
Who the hell can trust you in this situation! … Ah, right, your decoy skill! Why are you chasing after the frog in the first place?! Hurry up and use your Decoy skill to lure it towards you!
I’ve been using that skill since the beginning! Even frogs have the capacity to grow and learn! Plus, I’m wearing metal armour which frogs hate, so the Decoy skill isn’t having much effect!
Bind!!!
Seems like it really was the right choice not to go after Aqua.
N-No, wait! If it wasn’t a frog, my decoy would’ve definitely worked. Please believe in me!
… Wait, hold on.
Why do I have so many skill points.
What’s wrong, Kazuma? Is there something wrong with the card?
… Well, it’s not exactly something wrong. It’s just… 
My time might finally be here.
–Seriously, what do you mean by your time might finally be here!? And Darkness too, how could you forget about me while I’m inside the frog’s stomach!? Isn’t the role of a Crusader to protect her companions!?
I’m sorry.
You know me too well… N-No, wait, Megumin, now is not the time for that! I made a really amazing discovery! So that’s why there’s a place I want to go!
I’m heading to Wiz’s shop! Forget waiting at home! Once we are done there, we are heading off after that idiot!
Fu-Fuhahahahaha! Hahaha! Please look for me, she says! Hahahaha! What a spoilt goddess! She’s dailiying and secretly hoping for someone to come after her, while setting off on a journey to take out the Demon King! Fuhahahaha!
Vanir-san, you shouldn’t laugh so much! Aqua-sama went out on her own, you know!? Aaah, what should I do… This is Aqua-sama we are talking about, so I’m sure she’s gotten into some kind of trouble and is crying… So this is why she wanted to purify me the other day. It was to get rid of the barrier…
Vanir, I’ll take all the level reset potions that you have! Don’t worry about the price!
H-Hey, Kazuma, just what do you intend to do with those potions?
To reset my levels, of course! Through increasing and resetting my levels, I’m finally going to become a cheat protagonist myself!
… Oh yes. So that is how it is. Humans truly come up with some interesting ideas. Repeatedly reducing your levels in order to more easily gain more levels and stockpiling skill points that way… But, well, normally, even if someone can do such a thing, there’s no need to go out of their way to do it.
… They wouldn’t do that? Why not? Isn’t this perfect for gaining all the skill points they want?
Most normal people don’t need to worry so much about skill points. Almost everyone would be born with a certain number of skill points. It’s what they commonly refer to as natural talent. If you recall, that annoying goddess bought all the Archpriest skills with just the points she hand when she first became an Archpriest, didn’t she?
Well, that cheating goddess is a pretty unique case, so let’s leave her aside for the moment. For instance, Crimson Demons are born with a high affinity for magic, so most of them have no problems learning Advanced Magic. From the moment they become an Archwizard, they’ll usually have enough points to learn Advanced Magic. Even in the cases where they don’t, they have the “Farming
… Even so, everyone would want more skill points, won’t they? Just killing a few frogs from outside the town would gain you a few levels. If everyone in this town were to repeat that process, won’t they have enough skill points to learn every skill in their class like Aqua?
… Umm, Kazuma…
Hm?
… It’s not that easy to raise your level, you know? Normally, it would take around a year to reach level ten. The target level for leaving this town beginner is 20, and it would usually take about five years to achieve that.
Megumin gains a lot of experience by taking out whole groups of enemies with her Explosion, and I eat plenty of foods stuffed with experience, so we gain levels a lot faster than most people. But, you, well…
People with no talent have an easier time gaining levels. This is common knowledge in this world!
Ah!
In the first place, the only reason you can consider reducing your level so candidly is because you’re from another world. The lower your level, the weaker you get. The people who grew up in this harsh world would scarcely accept becoming weaker, even for a short moment. Only someone who grew up in a peaceful world like you could so easily accept reducing your level on purpose. Besides, unless one intends to learn some special skills like Explosion, by the time one becomes a veteran, they would already have learnt all the skills they need. Almost no one else would purposefully stick to the weakest class like you.
… From another world?
What do you mean by he came from another world? Wasn’t Kazuma born in this world?
… I recall him saying that he came from a faraway country… 
I’ll tell you about it later. Well, anyway, now I understand why people of this world wouldn’t make use of such a method. But I’m fine with the downsides, so please sell me all the level reset potions you have.
Unfortunately, there aren’t any left. That was an illegal item in the first place. Even creating it is illegal.
Then why were you jerking me around all this time for!? You read my mind, so you knew exactly what I wanted from the start, didn’t you!?
Fuhahaha, your dark emotions are delicious as always! Still, brat, it’s still too early to give up. As thanks for your delicious dark emotions, allow Moi to tell you something nice.
All you need is to reduce your level, right? In this world, there’s a certain status effect that is considered particularly fiendish known as level drain. If you work with a monster that can inflict such a status…
I-I see! With that, I can raise and reduce my levels at will!
Yes, indeed. However, the only monsters capable of inflicting level drain are really powerful undead type monsters. Normally, even finding one is a tough prospect, and amicably working with them is nearly impossible … But, fortunately, there is a powerful high class and friendly undead Lich right here!
Amazing! Unlike a certain useless goddess, you’re actually useful every once in a while!
U-Umm… Liches do have the ability to inflict level drain, but unfortunately, I can’t inflict such a status effect at will. If a Lich attacks with hostile intent, they can inflict a random status effect while doing so, of which level drain is but one of them. Paralysis, sleep, fear, and curse are other possible results. There is also the possibility of inflicting life threatening status effects like instant death or petrification, so…
Is that so? Well, that’s a shame. Just forget everything I just said…
Steady effort is the best way to gain power. Power that’s easily gained will always have a cost that needs to be paid someday. And most of them usually comes with pretty huge demerits as well.
Hey, if I bring a goddess that can grant any kind of wish along with me, wouldn’t that be like asking a genie for an infinite number of wishes?
Even if you break into the Demon King’s castle and head for the Demon King, he would be protected by his bodyguards, so there won’t be any other option other than a straight up fight. If you think about it that way, the party composition you mentioned before about Mitsurugi’s party plus Yunyun and Aqua isn’t bad at all. It’s definitely thanks to you that Aqua can even break the barrier and corner the Demon King like this. You’ve already done enough, now is the time to rest.
Yeah. This is Aqua, after all. For all we know, she might have already gotten cold feet and is on her way back now. So, all we need to do is wait for her at home with a lecture prepared.
… Say, Wiz, can I ask where your teleport waypoints are?
My first waypoint is set at the entrance of this town. My second waypoint has been set at the Crimson Demon Village due to business reasons.
Wiz, first, change the waypoint you’ve set at the Crimson Demon Village to anywhere else.
The last waypoint is placed at what is said to be the deepest dungeon on this continent that I use to gather materials–
That’s it!
Wiz, please take me with you to the dungeon. And when my level goes up high enough, please use level drain on me.
Eeh!?
Kazuma, weren’t you listening to her!? A Lich’s status effects are entirely random. Petrification and instant death are obvious, but with your constitution, even a status effect like curse that saps your stamina would prove fatal to you!
You are usually very cautious, so why do you come up with such reckless ideas every so often!? Right now Aqua isn’t here, if you die, that’ll be… 
Oh, shut up! You two, go speak with all the adventurers who have skills that would seem useful! I want to be able to start learning skills immediately the moment I get back from the dungeon!
I might have a reputation for being an unscrupulous brute of a man, but I haven’t fallen so low that I would push everything off to someone else to handle! The status afflicting attack of a lich can result in a level drain, curse, paralysis, sleep, fear, petrification, and instant death, was it!? Amongst those, I need to avoid instant death, petrification, and curse, right!? You two have spent a lot of time with me, so tell me, do I really seem like the kind of man who would be unlucky enough to receive those status effects!? Now, hurry up and go!
A-Are you insane, Kazuma!? Um, wouldn’t it be best to at least get a priest to cast Bless on you before you get level drained–!?
W-Wait a minute, Kazuma, I can go with you to act as a meat shield against the monsters! It would be safer–!
So, I’m terribly sorry, but can I trouble you to train me? I know it’s a little thick-skinned of me to ask a former Demon King’s General to help me gain the power to defeat the Demon King, but…
T-That’s, well, I too am worried about Aqua-sama, so I don’t mind, but… I can’t guarantee your safety with just me alone. The dungeon is really huge. It’s easy to get lost, and there are a lot of traps too… And most importantly, will my attack really not kill you… Ah, right!
Vanir-san! You can use your powers of foresight to check in advance if a status effect fatal to Kazuma-san would be applied. P-Plus, with Vanir-san there, we’ll be able to divine the correct path and see through any traps in our way.
Moi refuses.
Fuhahaha, yes, tasting such dark emotions are precisely why this conversation has gone on so long! It is delicious indeed! The dark emotions from you two are truly delicious!
Moi doesn’t care what happens to the Demon King, but why must a devil like Moi do something that might end up helping that goddess!? Fuhahaha, this will be interesting indeed! A goddess setting out on a mysterious journey, only to get lost and resort to chewing grass for sustenance before starving to death! Plus, there’s not a chance that she on her own would ever make it close to the Demon King’s castle. Fuhahahaha!
Vanir-san! Can’t you bring yourself to lend them a hand in such a situation!? If you are going to go that far, I have my own plans too!
Oh ho? Why don’t you tell me exactly what you plan? Do you really think Moi would cave in from mere threats–
I bought this crate of products in secret. I was considering returning some of it because there’s too much, but on second thought– Aah! Those aren’t the ones I’m planning on returning! Those are important goods, so don’t take them away!
Come to think of, Vanir, I still owe you a favour, don’t I? If you agree to safely escort and bring me back from the dungeon, I’ll return that favour right now.
… Favour?
Remember that time Aqua tossed me out of the mansion? You helped me sneak back into the mansion that night, didn’t you? I promised to buy some useless high priced goods from Wiz’s shop back then, didn’t I?
Oh ho, that did happen, didn’t it? … Rejoice, Wiz, the various pieces of trash that you bough will soon be turned to cash! So… Hey, let go already! There’s nothing important in this box at all! I’m selling it all away!
Wait! That isn’t garbage at all! That’s a rosary that is said to bring about wonderful encounters just by wearing it…!
Aah, sorry, that isn’t the items I want to buy. I already have something in mind. Vanir will probably be jumping for joy to be able to finally sell those items…
Do you understand, Emperor Zell? If something were to happen to me, it’ll be up to you to save the world.
Listen well, Emperor Zell, even if something were to happen to me, don’t destroy the world in the process of taking revenge, you hear? That isn’t something your mother would want.
What is it, Black demonic beast? I usually lose to you, but Emperor Zell is here today, so I won’t lose. If I detect a hint of hostility from you, I’ll wake Emperor Zell up and have him get rid of you instantly.
… W-What? What’s with you today? Why are you sticking to me so much today?
Are you here to stop me after knowing that I’m heading off to take out the Demon King? But you’re too naive. Don’t think that you’ll be able to delay my departure just because your fur is a little fluffy… But, well, if you don’t mind letting me touch your belly too, I wouldn’t mind delaying my departure until tomorrow.
You’ll get divine retribution if you lay your claws on the soft skin of a goddess. I occasionally feel the aura of a human coming from you. What’s up with that? You always smell nice even though you are a cat. Are you aiming to become the god of soap or something? Oh, no, you can’t become the god of baths. I’m already the goddess of water, so our domains would overlap.
Ara, did you come to see me off too?
You have an unusually serious look on your face today. What, are you ready to move on now?
You still haven’t grown tired of those stories yet? … I see. Well, it’s best for spirits to naturally go to heaven after settling their regrets here, so that’s fine. But make sure you keep out of sight of Eris, okay? She’s really hard headed, so she won’t hesitate to send you on immediately.
… Say, didn’t I tell you to stop saying that? That’s a death flag, you know?
Say, you two are really making it really hard for me right now. Actually, I might miss the midnight carriage if things go on like this…
Oh, very well. Let me tell you a particularly nostalgic story of mine… That was back when I was hard at work receiving the dead souls up in heaven. On that day, a hiki-NEET who died in a really rare way got sent to me wearing a tracksuit…
Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! Begone, little goblins! Do you want to become the experience points of our customer so badly!? Unfortunately, we have no interest in small fry like you! Now, open a path!
I never thought there’d come a day where I could go on an adventure with Kazuma-san and Vanir-san like this! Today, I’m not the same old shopkeeper who always gets lectured by Vanir-san; I’ll show you the power of the famous great mage that I was known as!
Leaving Vanir aside, well… Is it really okay not to bring any weapons or armour, Wiz?
It’s fine! Liches can only be damaged by magical weapons, monsters that have a lot of arcana within them, or high level magic! I am the King of Undead, after all. You know, this is the first place where I met Vanir-san. I’m going to give it my all!
Perfect! Perfect! Today, Moi is in perfect condition! Fuhahahaha! A mere ogre dares to stand in my way!? How impudent! There’s no need to use magic, allow Moi to rend it limb from limb with my bare hands!
You’re in a good mood today, Vanir-san! But, unless you let Kazuma deal the last blow, the experience points…
This ogre will probably… Yes, I’ve reached level twenty! Thanks to you two, my levels have been rising really rapidly.
Hmm, your level is already this high… Moi always knew you didn’t have much talent as an adventurer, but to think that it’s to such a degree… But, well, one supposes you can think of it as having a talent for gaining levels quickly… 
You are the absolute worst person to receive such words from. At least poke fun at me like you usually do…
R-Right then, let’s be on our way… Vanir-san, this is fine, right?
Indeed, there is no problem. The sight of my healthy customer is visible to me.
Stop referring to me as your customer, just address me normally. Now, then, please!
… So it really went off successfully. You are truly fortunate.
Eh?
Fuhahaha! Did that worry you? Worry not! Until you take those items off my hands, you need not worry for your safety… Oho, yes, these are some wonderful dark emotions indeed!
S-Say, Vanir… how deep are we right now? We’ve walked quite some distance by now, haven’t we? I have absolutely no idea how much time has passed. I didn’t get the chance to bring any snacks with me before I came here.
From what my all seeing eyes tell me, the twentieth floor is the lowest floor in this place. As for time, about half a day has passed. Don’t worry about food, Moi has made adequate preparations, so there’s no need to worry.
… Normally, any spelunkers would explore this dungeon slowly and cautiously, taking several months to reach the bottom. The only reason we made it this far in such a short time is because of me using my powers of foresight to identify the traps and the right paths to take. If you understand that, then it would behoove you to buy a few more items than just what you originally wanted… Still, this dungeon has a pretty nice feel to it. Moi could very much imagine taking this dungeon for myself after dealing with the boss.
W-We can’t do that, Vanir-san! I’ll make your dungeon for you! I’ll be in real trouble if you stopped helping out with my shop now!
… Say, just what is up with the clothes you’re wearing? I originally decided not to ask about it, but it really does bother me…
Hmm? Oh, these clothes? They were given to me by the widower madam that lives next door. She saw me cleaning gutters in my suit, so she gave it to me to try as it is easier to move in. What do you think? Does it suit me?
In this place, it makes you look like some kind of rare monster.
Hmm, so this makes me seem like a rare monster, huh? Moi needs to render my thanks to that madam when we next meet.
… Vanir-san seems to be more interested in the neighbours than me… even though I’ve been with him for far longer…
Ho, to think that there would even be a Cerberus here! This creature’s fur remains warm in any circumstances, so it’s highly sought after in the winter! Wiz, don’t let it go! If we successfully take it down, Moi shall let you eat meat for a week!
I’m sorry, but I like to enjoy the taste of protein from time to time too! I really like dogs, but I’m really sorry… Aah! Don’t run away!
Rooooaaaaar!
Fuhahaha, what an impudent lizard! Let’s demonstrate once and for all just which is stronger, a dragon or a devil! … H-Hey, Wiz, isn’t it done yet!? This guy is preparing to use its breath weapon! Moi is holding it down, but my body is starting to become charcoal!
B-But, Vanir-san, it might be a lesser subspecies, but it’s still a dragon! Dragons have high amounts of arcana within them, so it’ll hurt if it bites me!
Wiz, now is not the time to be saying such things! Vanir is getting eaten!
Argh, it ate one of my arms! Moi cannot gather replacement materials for my body in this dungeon, so if it keeps breaking pieces off of me, Moi shall vanish altogether! Grah, this leaves me no choice! Dragon scales go for a lot of money and are worth a lot of experience points, but, Wiz! Forget it, take care of it with magic!
Understood! Stand back, Cursed Lightning!!
Amazing… so a lich is stronger than dragon or devil.
!?
Fufu, I’m not called the King of Undead for nothing… W-What are you doing, Vanir-san? S-Stop, don’t bring your severed stump any closer…!
Still, my level is almost twenty five. It feels like I gain a level for every battle we fight… The speed at which I gain levels is as amazing as ever, but I think I’m starting to approach my limit. Plus, Vanir is starting to struggle too, so maybe we should call it here…?
What are you saying!? The only reason Moi is struggling is because Moi is trying my best to restrain the monsters without killing them. If it is just getting rid of them, Moi can easily get down to the bottom floor in an instant!
But just as Kazuma-san said, we are going to have a hard time pressing on like this… In this case, I shouldn’t hold back. Cursed Necromancy!
Alright, let’s turn a few more dragon-class monsters into my undead minions… A chance like this doesn’t come by very often, so let’s go all the way to the bottom floor today.
… Wiz, you really are an amazing mage.
D-Do you really think so!? N-No, I still have a long way to go… C-Come now, let’s carry on!
Sorry, can we take a little break? I’m getting a little worn out. I know we came all the way down here, but the tension got released the moment I sat down, and the fatigue is…
Now, then, brat, Moi has prepared various items such as food, fatigue relieving potions, water and medicine, items that can instantly create a barrier, amongst other things.
Today is the special dungeon sale! All products are available for a fivefold price increase! Now, feel free to peruse, dear customer!
Dammit, it’s already caught up to us! Stella! Stella! Are you sure there aren’t any more scrolls containing Flash!? If we can blind it just once more…!
There aren’t any left! We used the last one just now!
We just managed to get the treasure! Are things really going to end right here!?
I don’t want to die… I don’t want to die!
The stairway to the twelfth floor is just ahead! This monster might be persistent, but it wouldn’t chase us up to where there isn’t as much arcana in the air! We’ll be safe as long as we can get up there!
Waaah!
So it finally decided to show itself. No choice, Stella! Prepare your magic! We’ll give it one good blast to startle it, and during that time…
Welcome to Wiz’s magic item shop, deep dungeon branch!
Eh?
It must be fate for us to meet right here! Now then, I have plenty of goods that would be useful in a dungeon… Oh?
You should run too! That thing… that thing caught up to us–!
Isn’t that a hell neroid!? What’s a hell neroid doing out here!? Here boy, over here. Come on.
Kyaaaaaa! Your hand! Your hand is…!
Now now, don’t bite on my hand. That isn’t something you can eat. Now, hurry up and spit it back out! Come on, get on with it… Vanir style Destruction Ray!
What an uncivilized neroid. This must be a stray. Still, why would a domesticated creature that’s found only in hell show up in such a place… ? Could the arcana here be so strong that it inadvertently opened a connection to hell?
Well, there’s no need to concern myself too much with a single strange neroid. Now then, dear customers, Moi has plenty of items that are essential in the dungeon! The prices are set at the standard dungeon price, but please, feel free to browse.
Barrier stones! He has disposable barrier stones! Pardon me, please sell these to me! Just how much is the dungeon price!?
He has medicine and potions too…! W-We’re saved… ! The stairs to the second floor is just around the corner too! With these, we’ll be able to make it back to the surface!
There’s even food available! All our food got eaten by that guy earlier… ! We’re saved! We’re saved!
Thank you very much! Fuhaha! Business has been roaring from the moment the store is opened! Perhaps Moi should consider doing this on a regular basis!
… God…
Even if you are my customers, it’s terribly rude to compare me to a god.
Ah! S-Sorry!
To think that Moi would actually end up clearing my stock. Thank you very much, dear customers.
No, t-that’s our line…! If you hadn’t shown up, we would have been doomed. These items really are exactly what we needed! I’m really grateful!
No, no, seeing my customer’s safe is the most important thing. Now then, thank you for your business! Please come again!
Just who was that person…?
Oh, god whose name I do not know, I give you thanks from the bottom of my heart…
Why would that rare monster want to take a walk in this dungeon anyway? I’ve already eaten, so I’d really want to get going now.
Vanir-san wearing that weird outfit really does give off a feeling of a rare monster, doesn’t he? He seems to have taken a liking to that outfit for some reason… I only hope he doesn’t get attacked by some adventurer…
Still, I wonder where he went. It might draw other monsters to us too, but do you want to try calling out for him…?
… That’s a… monster… right?
It must be. There’s no way a normal girl would just be hanging around this deep in the dungeon… 
That’s odd, my Enemy Detection isn’t reacting at all. Does she not bear any hostility towards us? But, judging from her age, it’s hard to see her as an adventurer… 
It isn’t reacting? Actually, just what kind of monster is she? She doesn’t seem like a ghost, and a doppelganger wouldn’t normally take that kind of form… 
Onii-chan, Onee-chan, are you two bad adventurers? Or good adventurers?
… If I have to choose, I’d say, a good adventurer.
I’m not an adventurer, but I don’t think I’m a bad person.
What a relief. My name is Amarilice! Say, do you want to have a chat? I’ve been stuck in this dungeon for a very long time, and it’s really lonely down here.
… I don’t mind talking, but what are you doing all by yourself this deep in the dungeon? In the first place… Well, are you human?
… Right now, I’m no longer human. You know, the old man who raised me was a magician. For the sake of his magical research, he turned me into a chimera. After that, I can no longer live in the cities, so he told me to hide myself in this dungeon. He said he’ll come get me when he finds a way to turn me back to normal, so I’ve been living here ever since.
Umm… What is that old man to you? What happened to your parents?
Papa and Mama died. The old man said he bought me. He brings me food to eat, so he’s a very good person!
In that case, let onee-chan fix you right up! I might look this way, but I’m actually a really amazing mage. I used to know a chimera too, so I’ll definitely be able to turn you back to normal!
R-Really? Will you really turn me back?
Yes, of course. So there’s no need to be afraid, you should come closer. This dragon zombie is my friend.
But will onee-chan really not be scared when you see my body? You won’t be disgusted?
It’ll be fine, onee-chan can make friends even with ghosts. So don’t worry, come over…
Onee-chan!
Aaah!
W-W-W-Wait! A-A-A-Amarilice-chan, wait a minute, okay!? Onee-chan will calm down in a moment, so please wait a minute!
What’s wrong, Onee-chan? Didn’t you say you wouldn’t be scared!? You said you’d fix me! You promised!
Young lady, please calm down! Onii-chan will give you a sweet! Here!
W-W-W-Wait it’s fine onee-chan isn’t scared or anything I’ll fix you I’ll turn you back to normal just please calm down aaaah Vanir-san Vanir-san Vanir-saaaaaaan!
Ah, wait, I do like children, but please wait a minute young lady!
Why are you two raising such a racket… Oh, is that Amarilice-dono?
Oh, that beautiful mask must be Vanir-sama. Fancy meeting you in this dungeon.
… …?
Amarilice-dono, you’re as lovely as always. Moi begs pardon to interrupt you while you’re enjoying feasting on the dark emotions of fear, but these two are my companions.
Oh, that was rude of me. I hope you take no offense. Ah, well, you see, I was chasing Strelksy, my pet hell neroid that suddenly ran away, when I stumbled upon this place. It seems like the large concentrations of raw arcana created several connections from this place to hell… Anyway, I followed the path and end up running into these two, and it has been quite some time since I had a snack, so…
Wait, what? Amarilice isn’t a chimera, but actually a devil? Then what was all that talk about a magical experiment and chimera and what not?
Oh, that was all a lie. You see, I have a particular fondness for the taste of fear, which is why I assumed this form… Oh, these feelings of embarrassment and rage are more to the taste of Vanir-sama. I’m not particularly fond of them myself, so thanks, but no thanks.
Now, then, I should get back to looking for my pet… Oh, that’s right, Vanir-sama, you can use your powers of foresight to locate my Strelksy!
Oh, my, look at the time. We should really be going. Farewell, Amarilice-dono! May we meet again in hell!
… R-Right…
Sniff… sniff… It’s good that she wasn’t an actual chimera… It’s a good thing, but it’s still really hard to accept…
How long are you two going to be sniffling? Come on, we should get going. Fuhahaha, more importantly, rejoice, Wiz! The items that the brat didn’t buy were all sold off too! Perhaps we should make this a regular event!
… I think I’m starting to hate devils a little…
W-Wait, isn’t it a little presumptuous to apply the actions of one individual onto the entire race?
Vanir-san, just a little bit! Just a little bit would do!
Stop, to a devil, mana is the source of our powers and even the very foundation of my existence! H-Hey, stop trying to use Drain Touch on me! If you need to replenish mana, just drain it from the next monster we meet!
Monsters who live deep in the dungeons have a lot of arcana in them, so their mana is really heavy and feels like it’ll give me indigestion! Just give me a little bit! Aren’t the mana of devils said to be of the highest quality!? Just a little bit! Just a very small sip would do!
S-Stop it, stop trying to touch my mask! In the first place, how could we run into enough monsters that it drained a lich like you in such a short period of time? It’s certainly sufficient for raising the brat’s levels quickly, but the number of monsters we are seeing is still truly odd…
That’s probably the work of this rosary! It’s said to bring about wonderful encounters just by wearing it, and it seems like the monsters in this dungeon are also affected… aaaaah, Vanir-san, what are you doing!? Give it back, don’t try and throw it away!
Moi knew something was off…! Moi shall restrain the next monster that we come across, so bear with it until then! … Still, do you really wish to get a boyfriend so badly? Moi does have a friend who is somewhat lacking in brains, but he’s quite handsome by most standards and good at taking care of others. He’s a devil named Maxwell who came here from another world, but Moi could introduce him to you if you want.
… A considerate and handsome man… No, as long as he’s a compassionate and kind person, his appearance doesn’t matter too much… When you say he’s lacking in brains, what exactly do you mean? Is he bad at calculations?
He lacks the back half of his head entirely.
He’s literally lacking in brains!? Of course not! Come to think of it, aren’t devils genderless!?
… Oh? Are you starting to feel sleepy? Well, that is only to be expected. Almost one full day has passed on the surface. Here, drink this potion. It’ll bring you back to full alertness in a single blow.
Vanir-san, you brought that along? But the side effects are–!
What exactly is this revitalization potion made out of? It’s not addictive, is it?
Of course not, to someone with as high luck as you, this potion has practically no side effects… Yes, I see it now. I see a future where you are practically bouncing off the walls after drinking that potion.
Don’t play with my heart like you did earlier, alright?
I’ve earned quite a nest egg of skill points, so should we not head back around now? We’re here to raise my level, not conquer the dungeon, after all.
What are you saying!? We’ve come all the way down here, so let’s push through to the end! At the very bottom of this dungeon, in the owner’s room, lie vast riches and powerful equipment! They will surely be of use if you plan to fight with the Demon King-san!
Well, I’m still not fully decided if I really want to take on the Demon King… Actually, isn’t he a friend to you two? Do you really think nothing of someone taking him out?
Getting defeated at the end is just part of the job for a Demon King, right, Vanir-san?
Indeed. Constantly causing trouble for humanity, clashing magnificently with a band of valiant adventurers, before magnificently exiting the stage. That’s what a Demon King is. Besides, the Demon King is getting on in age. I’m sure he wants to end his reign with a bang and pass his crown to his daughter soon.
So the Demon King is getting up in years, huh? But, still, if he’s still the Demon King, that must mean he is still the strongest being in the entire Demon King’s army, right? … Or he is going senile to the point where even I can deal with him somehow?
No, he’s not necessarily the strongest. His daughter has probably exceeded him in strength by this point. As for whether you can deal with him, Moi cannot say, but even as old as he is, the Demon King is still strong enough to crush an ogre’s skull with a single hand.
But, wait, isn’t strength everything to the people of this world? I was sure the position of the Demon King would be taken by whoever happens to be the strongest, or something simple like that.
Do you really think that everyone in this world is a musclebrain? Or does the country you came from award its highest governmental position to whoever has the highest combat capability? Moi cannot speak for your world, but for the position of the Demon King… first, they must have the charisma to command a large number of Generals. Then, they need enough strength that they wouldn’t be looked down on by their subordinates. And Moi supposes they would also need to be fairly intelligent as well. Out of all of them, the most important quality would be the charisma to manage a band of Generals with their varied personality quirks.
Looking at you and Wiz, I’ll have to say that the Demon King probably has a lot of trouble with that.
In any case, it would be good if we could find any items that would increase your meagre combat prowess. Of course, what I’m hoping for are treasures that could be easily converted into money! Wait for me, o master of this dungeon! Moi shall be taking all your treasures with me! Fuhahaha!
By the way, have you thought about what kind of skills you want to pick up, Kazuma-san? I can teach you teleport before we leave this dungeon if you want.
Crimes committed with the use of teleport or light bending magic will receive a much harsher sentence.
What!? I-I-I didn’t say anything! I just thought that teleport seems like it’d be useful in any number of ways! You know, like using it to escape if I run into a tough spot after sneaking into the Demon King’s castle!
… If you are intending to use Teleport as a way to escape, it wouldn’t work unless you do something about the barrier first. Leaving that aside, perhaps you might want to learn one of my skills first? Such as my eye beams and instant death rays?
… If a human like me were to use an instant death ray…
Of course, you would die. But think about it. The exact instant you unleash your ultimate technique, you fall dead on the spot. Your opponent would surely be taken aback. There aren’t that many other art forms that you can dedicate your mind and body to like this.
Unlike a certain goddess, I’m not intending to commit my soul to the perfection of an art!
Vanir-style death ray! Vanir-style death ray! Vanir-style… Grah, there’s way too many of them! Wiz, do something about it! This is getting tiresome! Turn them all to dust at once with Explosion!
I-I can’t use Explosion magic in a dungeon! If the dungeon collapses… Ah, my dragon zombies! They just got surrounded by a horde of minotaurs!
Uwaah! Hey, they are over here too! The monsters are coming this way too!
Graaaah!
Eep!
Dammit, to think I’d appreciate Aqua’s good points only at such a time! Like hell I’m dying here, after I bring Aqua back, I’m going to live a decadent life full of joys! I’m going to laze around drinking wine early in the morning and go out for some fun at night! I also want to travel somewhere for a vacation! Even though I’m an adventurer, I haven’t really seen much of this world at all!
Ah, he said it! Did you hear that, Vanir-san!? The usually dishonest Kazuma-san finally spilled his heart out! Kyaa, realizing your true feelings during a time a crisis, how romanti– ugh!
Wait, Wiz!?
Then I must make sure Kazuma-san and Aqua-sama meet once again to affirm their love for each other! Vanir-san, I’m going to use a large amount of mana now, so I’ll be counting on you to replenish my mana after the battle, okay!?
Graaaah!
Aaaah!
Cursed Petrification!
Fuhahaha, well done, Wiz! Now then, Moi too shall… In the name of the duke of hell, Vanir! Crawl forth, my servants!
What’s the matter, Vanir-sama? It’s quite troublesome for you to call us up out of the blue in this busy season… 
Yeah, spare a thought for us who have to work our asses off to cover you after you left your territory to go play on the surface.
More importantly, what’s with your clothes? That’s not how a duke of hell should dress…
Finally, there’s someone strong enough to make it all the way here. Allow me to compliment you for conquering the dungeon this far. Now, show me your strength! I, the king of undead, an immortal vampire that has lived for a thousand years shall be your… your…
Oh, my, when did vampires take over as the king of undead when liches still exists? It’s certainly a nice bit of comedy after coming all this way. Ufufufu, ahahahaha!
Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! Fuhahaha! My, my, this has truly been a pretentious dungeon you’ve created. Then again, what could anyone expect from a fledgling who has barely lived a thousand years!? Fuhahahahaha!
… Um, I’ll go put on some tea now, so, w-why don’t we talk about your business first…?
Fuhahahaha! Fuhahahaha!
Ah, this is legendary tier! A legendary tier magic item!
Umm, well… sorry for the trouble my companions are causing.
No, no, I should be sorry for creating such an ostentatious dungeon when I’m just a mere vampire. After you are done, I intend to go back to my home in the countryside and live a peaceful life as a tomato farmer.
Yeah, I suppose that’s a decent way to live too. You won’t end up having to suffer something like this, at least.
Indeed, if I have to go through something this horrifying, I would rather live a quiet life in seclusion. In my thousand years of life, I’ve never thought I’d be staring down a horde of demons and undead like this. And not only that, but also led by a lich and a greater devil that has lived far longer than me. I’m happy enough just be not getting destroyed.
Fuhahaha, what a mountain of gold! With the money gained from what that brat is buying and all this treasure, Moi shall be able to finance a big establishment! Yes, a casino! Wiz, let’s create a casino with this money! A giant casino that makes Elroad look like a roadside poker game!
Aah, look at this, look at this, Vanir-san! This item emanates a strong magical aura! I don’t know what effect it has, but I’m sure it’s powerful enough to turn the world on its head…!
Oh, dear, this is a problem! There’s too much treasure! There’s no way to carry them all back like this!
That’s a problem, Vanir-san. What should we do? I can feel strong magic coming from every single item here. I really want to bring them all back if possible… 
Wiz, teach me teleport right now. I’ll register this place as a waypoint. That’d solve our problem, right?
Brat, you should take this with you. This is the weapon with the strongest magical aura in this mountain of treasure. It’d fetch a princely sum if sold, but it’d be better served in your hands.
This armour seems pretty powerful too. It radiates a strong magic aura, so there shouldn’t be any problems if you wear this to the Demon King’s castle.
… It’s too heavy to move in.
Ah, right, that armour can only be equipped by Crusaders. And that sword too can only be used by Sword Masters.
Say, are there any powerful items that can be used by an Adventurer?
M-My apologies, not many people choose to specialize into the Adventurer class, so there aren’t many craftsmen who would make powerful equipment for them… At the very least, I don’t have any of them in my possession…
Fuhahahaha! Isn’t this just fine, brat who could never become a hero, this is more your stride! Weak equipment and skills that are hastily put together! If you defeat the Demon King in such a state, you would truly be hailed as a great hero! Oh, your future is showing itself to me! You shall be hailed as the harem bastard, the strongest hero, the strongest of the weakest class, and many other amusing titles! Fuhahaha!
Dammit, what is wrong with this world? Ah, but Crusader exclusive equipment, huh? It looks pretty ominous being all black like that, but I suppose it’d make a good gift to bring back for Darkness. I don’t suppose there’s a magic staff too, is there?
I don’t really keep a lot of equipment for mages. Ah, right, this ring I’m wearing increases the power of any spells the owner casts. Do you want to take it with you?
N-No, that’s fine. It feels like I’m trying to strip you bare, so… Actually it kinda feels like we are robbing you, so sorry about that.
No, no, a dungeon is there to be broken into. The items and treasure here all came from the adventurers who tried to challenge this dungeon and failed, so don’t worry about it. But this ring is one of my possessions from back when I’m still alive, so I suppose it’s a relief.
Is that a ring that increases the power of spells?
It’s probably too late to catch the late night carriage by now. Plus, you might have cheated with the fatigue relieving potion and the alertness potion, but rapidly leveling up and keeping a state of high tension for a long period of time does put a certain amount of strain on your body, to say nothing of the day you spent in combat. It’d be best to spend the night resting before setting off tomorrow.
Thank you. I’ll definitely bring that idiot back here.
Moi does not care about that goddess.
That isn’t good at all! … Kazuma-san, if it comes down to it, I’ll help protect this town from the shadows. I’ll make sure to protect this place that Aqua-sama calls home, so set off without worries. When you make it back, I’ll go with you to raise your levels or whatever you want.
There are still quite a fair bit of treasure left in the dungeon, but Moi understands that you have pressing business to attend to, so we’ll leave the rest of the treasure to after you come back. So, please do come back alive. Just thinking about making it to the depths of the dungeon the long way round again gives me conniptions.
When you come back, I’ll properly teach you Advanced Magic, so please come back safely!
When it comes to Advanced magic, one must be intimately familiar with the gestures, chants, flow of mana, and all kinds of other factors that goes into casting the spell. It’s not something a person can learn in a single night… Ah, but as for Explosion Magic, you’ve been together with Megumin-san for a long time now, and you’ve spent every day observing her, right? Then–
I don’t need something like that.
Oh, the future is coming to me. A future where the brat learns advanced magic to make himself invisible and enters the public bath.
Thanks for the help, everyone! I’ll come again before we set off, so see you tomorrow!
… I thought the pick up point for the carriage is here, but did they move it without me knowing?
… Aqua-sama? Just where are you going dressed like that?
What a coincidence, meeting you at such an early hour… No, there’s no way this is a coincidence.
No, I was asking for more wine even after the bar has closed and before I knew it, it was morning. By the way, that’s the place I was drinking at.
Well, it can’t be helped if you’ve been drinking. I too get angry whenever I hear calls for the last order. Whenever that happens, it turns into a bitter endurance match. But they always call Kazuma-san to fetch me home.
I understand you very well, Aqua-sama. Whenever I get drunk, I always want to drink and celebrate more, so the last thing I want to do is head home.
By the way, the owner of that tavern said don’t worry about the tab, just please don’t come back…
I see, the owner is a tsundere. There’s no reason to bar any members of the pure and upright Axis Cult, so the owner is a tsundere to the core. Take it from a regular.
Understood, Aqua-sama! … So, back to my question, what’s with your outfit…?
Listen well, my devout Cecily. Seeing the current state of this world pains me. The proper, hardworking residents of this world are currently under threat of the Demon King. Thus, I shall now go on a journey to wipe out that root of evil!
W-What did you say!? In other words, Aqua-sama is joining the battle in person? What about Megu-tan!? I don’t see Megu-tan anywhere! No, I mean, what about Megumin-san and Kazuma-san? And that Crusader from the Eris church!?
This upcoming journey would be fairly grueling. I’ve judged that those three fledglings won’t be of much help. That’s why… I shall personally set off to defeat the Demon King!
You can’t… Er, I mean, Aqua-sama, it might be impudent of me, but I think that it’d be best to bring those three along. Otherwise, regardless of if you win or lose, you’ll get lectured.
… What should I do? Maybe I can smooth things over with a souvenir or two?
I don’t think that’ll work.
By the way, what do you intend to do from now on, Aqua-sama?
Well, first off, I thought I’d take a carriage to somewhere cold. The Demon King’s castle seems like it’d be in a cold place, don’t you think? Like, somewhere to the north?
Very well, Aqua-sama, please allow your humble servant Cecily to accompany you for part of the way.
If you are willing to go that far, then I suppose I’ll allow it, Cecily. Let’s head towards the north.
Roger, Aqua-sama. But first, let’s ask the carriage driver to head in the direction of the Demon King’s castle. They are professional transporters, after all. I’m sure they’ll take us to where we need to go.
As expected of Cecily, what a capable girl. As a reward, perhaps it’s about time I tell you the truth about–
Please don’t say anything more!
I’m home~
Welcome back!
You finally came back. I thought you would come back every few hours to rest between leveling, but you went and disappeared for over a day. I was really worried, you know?
Yeah! Seriously, this is why I should’ve gone with you to act as your meat shield. In the future… what is this?
It’s a souvenir. I heard that it was a powerful set of armour that only Crusaders could use, so I brought it back with me.
Oh, a class-limited item. Items that are class restricted tend to be fairly powerful. Were you not able to find any items that you could use, Kazuma?
Ah, well, it is a little hard to find equipment tailor-made for Adventurers. It’s not that popular a class, after all.
… Thank you. I’ll take good care of it.
A jet black suit of armour, huh? It’d be a good fit for your name.
Yeah. Though, with the colour and the design, it does make you seem a bit like one of the Demon King’s bodyguards if you were to wear it.
Ugh, well… I do think it’s a little odd for a holy knight to wear a suit of jet black armour, but, well… this armour is quite beautiful, isn’t it? It’s enchanted with powerful magic, and will adjust its proportions to fit its wielder. I’m sure it’ll look properly knight-like while I’m wearing it.
So, did you get anything for me?
Er, well, n-no…
I’m going to sleep. I don’t know where you’re planning to go, but you should probably have an early night too, Megumin. Tomorrow will be a busy day.
Is that so? Then, I should go to bed soon.
Umm, what are you doing? Weren’t you heading to bed?
I’ll go to bed… With you, Kazuma.
This journey will be far more dangerous than any of our previous outings. That’s why… let’s make sure neither of us have any regrets.
B-Being in this situation again i-is a little nerve-wracking, isn’t it? Are you okay? I-It’s not too tough on you, is it?
I-It’s fine, there’s no problem. Megumin, too, you shouldn’t push yourself.
This is the only piece of clothing I have that can really be said to be sexy… What do you think? Does it look good? Is it, um…
I-It looks fine. It’s very pretty, and, um, I’m turned on.
T-Turned on? Can’t you put it in… No, this is just like you.
You can’t hold it in any more, can you? It’s alright, I’ll accept all of you. So that we don’t regret anything, so that we don’t leave anything behind, please do as you wish.
… Is something wrong?
… I’m sorry.
… Um, is it because I’m no good? They might not be as big as Darkness or Aqua, but I think they have a pretty good shape. Would you like to take a look?
I really want to… No, that’s not it. To be honest, I want to do it. I really want to do it. My lower half is raging at me to continue. So it is not because you lack the charms. It’s just…
I really want to do it when Aqua and Darkness and everyone is in the house. Doing such stuff while worrying about them interfering. Sneaking off to your room and messing around in order to avoid their attention. Sure, they’ll interfere just when things are getting good, but–
… I truly adore that part of you. I love it so much, I just can’t get enough of it.
We’ll continue this on the night we bring Aqua back. That’s a promise, okay?
When you said sorry just now, I was really panicking inside until you explained yourself. So, I’m going to be a little mean tonight too. As payback.
Um… I’ll apologize, so isn’t there some way we can carry on…?
Y-You really are…! Can’t you appear cool until the very end? … Anyway… 
So there you have it. Darkness, stop fooling around in there and go back to your room!
Waah!
H-H-H-How did you know–
How did I know you were there? You worked yourself into a frenzy when Kazuma didn’t come back home yesterday, but tonight you dissappeared into the second floor before Kazuma even emerged from the bath! Crimson Demons have high intelligence! It’s child’s play for me to figure out what someone with nothing but perverted thoughts in their head like you would do!
M-My brain isn’t filled with…! I-I-If you are going to say that much, then you yourself are also–!
I didn’t get a souvenir, so I came up here to claim my compensation… Knowing you, the excitement you felt after receiving the armour coupled with the sense of loneliness last night made you think welcoming him in his room is a good idea, right? Then, upon hearing my voice, you jumped into this closet in a panic!
How do you know my actions so…! I-I just wanted to give my thanks for the armour…!
Giving your body in return for a present!? What a perverted girl! I’m content with simply embracing Kazuma, but you wouldn’t be satisfied with just that, would you!? You would’ve offered your body to Kazuma and confidently said ‘Here, this is your reward!’, right? Are you really that full of yourself!?
T-T-T-That’s not… That isn’t-! N-No, that’s not what I had in mind at all!
I’m sure you were getting excited peeking at me and Kazuma, that’s why you were seated like that! Isn’t that right!? What a perverted girl! Come on, stop wallowing in your fantasies and go back to your room already!
Wait, you went on ahead with Kazuma even though you knew I was there! You are just as perverted! Aaah, at least let me make an excuse…!
Kazuma, what are you spacing out for? You’re going to get hurt while learning new skills if you don’t pay attention.
O-Oh, sorry.
Brat… No, dear customer, I have confirmed the payment this morning. This is the biggest single sale the Vanir magic item shop has made since its opening, so to be honest, Moi cannot stop myself from smiling. Leave the house to me. Moi shall properly take care of that evil goddess and the raw chicken meat, so you may come without any worries.
Should it be go? … No, wait, what did you say just now? I understand what chicken meat is referring to, but what did you say about the other one?
Young man, you have protected me from the depredations of the wicked goddesses many times over. If you lose your life on this journey, you’re welcome to visit my domain in hell. I shall extend my greatest hospitality to you.
I really wish you wouldn’t say such inauspicious words…
Right, then, Kazuma, are you ready to learn some skills?
You’re heading off to fight the Demon King mano a mano, so it’s only right for us to beat you… I mean, properly train you before you go. Think of it as our farewell gift.
You were about to say beat me senseless, right? And I’m not planning on charging at the Demon King and fighting him one on one! Truth be told, all I really want to do is bring Aqua back!
Say, Kazuma, maybe it’s best if you don’t go on this journey.
Yeah. You’ve always been a little weird, but you are acting particularly weird today.
I’m glad for your concern, but right now I’m one of the strongest people in this town. Leave Aqua and the Demon King to me, you guys just make sure to protect this town where my mansion is located.
Listen to this guy. What do you mean, the strongest people in this town? I heard about what you did! You went to the dungeons under Vanir-san and Wiz-san’s protection to power level yourself, right!?
How is that different from spending a ton of money to buy a set of high class equipment!? And you still dare brag about it?
Don’t get full of yourself. You’re still crawling to us to teach you skills!
Right now I have skill points aplenty, and my level is above thirty! Having a level above thirty means I’m a veteran! I’m not like all you small fry who do nothing but laze around in Axel! Enough already, just teach me your skills!
You really got full of yourself just because you gained a few levels! If you want to learn my skills so much, fine! I’ll beat them into your body!
You are a small fry yourself! Just the other day, you were running away from a giant frog! If you want to see my skills so much, I’ll use Intermediate Magic on you!
Get him! If he falls here, he’s not a match for the Demon King anyway! Surround him and get him!
You guys will make a great warm up before u take on the Demon King! Show me all the skills that I haven’t learnt yet! My name is Satou Kazuma, I’ll take you all on!
Sorry, Kazuma-san, I was held up by something… W-What happened here?
Ah, thanks Wiz. You didn’t need to bring it all the way here for me.
I don’t really mind, but, really, what happened here!? I thought you were planning on learning the skills from the other adventurers…
Don’t worry about it. We decided to settle things so that we don’t leave any regrets behind. Well, as you can see, this is the result.
Umm… Kazuma-san, you’re lying down too, so I can’t tell what the result is…
I’m just lying down to catch my breath. I was facing all of them with just myself, so it could be considered my victory.
Stop spouting nonsense, Kazuma! You were barely standing by the time you got to the third person!
Everyone decided to go easy on you because you looked like you were about to cry!
… Oh, I see, it’s the adventurer style farewell! Then, allow me to…
If I receive an adventurer’s farewell from you, I’ll die even if you hold back.
It’s almost time to leave! All customers who are taking the carriage to Alcanretia, please board immediately.
… Say, I’ve been wondering about this since we left, but what happened to the armour?
It’s in here.
No, we are heading out right now, so put it on.
What are you saying? What would you do if it gets scratched or becomes dirty?
That’s my line. What are you even saying?
Now then, I’ll be heading off to bring that idiot back!
Yeah, go ahead! And take out the Demon King while you’re at it!
This is Aqua-nee-chan we are talking about, so she might have gotten lost and wandered into some weird place! She might have even gotten stuck in some hole somewhere, so bring her back even if you have to dig up half the country!
We’ll be expecting souvenirs, so don’t forget about them!
Leave this town to us. My newborn kid and my beautiful wife live here, after all. I’ll definitely protect it!
Darkness, stop messing around and put on your armour already! There’s the issue of protection, but seeing you cradle your present like that when I didn’t receive anything at all really grates on my nerves!
I’ll put it on when we get to an actually dangerous area, so let it rest already! The monsters around here won’t even faze me!
Hey, Kazuma! That sword of yours, it’s just an ordinary sword without any sort of magic on it, right!? Just in case, you should take this with you!
That’s technically an enchanted weapon. It isn’t a legendary tier weapon that can only be equipped by a specific class, so even you should be able to make use of it. Just make sure you bring it back to me after you defeat the Demon King!
Oh, I see. In the one in a million chance that Kazuma actually defeats the Demon King, that sword would become known as the sword wielded by the hero, and be worth a whole lot more. Kazuma, I’m pretty sure Dust picked up that sword from the body of a fallen adventurer he ran across in a dungeon, so there’s no need to give it back~
Dammit, Lynn, how could you ruin my get rich quick plan!?
Let’s go!
I didn’t see Chris amongst those adventurers. I really wanted to say goodbye before we head off to the Demon King’s Castle. She said she’d be busy for a while after hearing that the Demon King’s army is planning to attack the capital, and I haven’t seen her after that…
Oh, yeah, she wasn’t there, was she? Well, I can kind of guess why she’s so busy.
I really want to ask why you know such things, but… more importantly, look at this, you two. How do I look?
Like a subordinate of the Demon King.
It makes you look like a dark knight of some sort. Like the kind the Demon King might employ as a bodyguard.
You don’t use a shield and fight with a two handed sword, so with that black armour, you give off a very aggressive impression.
Urk…
By the way, did you hear about the commotion that happened in town while you were away in the dungeon?
The woman that Kazuma caught… The Demon King’s general, Serena, escaped.
Seriously?
It seems like Serena managed to puppet one of the watchmen for a short time and had him help her escape. That watchman was saying something about Serena being an exhibitionist afterwards.
From what I’ve heard, Serena showed the people she puppeted something too.
In order to focus on the defence of the town, no search party was sent out after her. The guild put a bounty on her and sent a notice out to the other cities, but that’s the extent of it. Serena is probably heading back to the Demon King’s castle too. Since we are taking the same route, we might run into her along the way.
In that case, I’ll have to teach her a lesson if we run into her. I don’t really feel satisfied with how we settled things back then.
There really aren’t that many travellers today, huh?
Oh yeah, Kazuma, how many skills did you pick up? Darkness and I just reached out to any adventurers in town who seemed strong or had useful skills, so I don’t know exactly what skills are available.
In terms of magical skills, I picked up Teleport and Intermediate Magic.
I-I-I see, Intermediate Magic. W-Well, you didn’t take Advanced Magic, so I guess that’s okay…
Advanced Magic requires complicated gestures and long chants to cast. Learning the skill seems like it’d require me to memorize all of it, and I don’t have the time for it right now. Wiz offered to teach me Advanced Magic when I get back, so–
You aren’t satisfied with just learning Intermediate Magic, but you want to learn Advanced Magic too!? Even with an Archwizard like me in the party!? Give me your card for a bit! …Ah, you have just enough points to learn Explosion Magic! I’m dumping it all–!
H-Hey, cut it out! I’m saving those for Advanced Magic and other useful skills! If you feel inadequate, then go learn some other skills! Don’t mess around with other’s adventurer’s card!
You messed with my card too, so how dare you say that now! … Ah! You learnt Golem Creation and Recovery Magic too! Are you trying to become a mage or something!? Your magic power is less than a tenth of my own!
You learnt Recovery Magic too? Won’t Aqua cry if she finds out?
Our escorts will be keeping watch during the night… We normally end up attracting undead whenever we camp out overnight, but things should go well this time.
… Yeah. Even though our numbers are small enough that it wouldn’t be surprising for some enterprising monster to come knocking, we seem to have a much easier time of it… It’s a far cry from our past trouble-filled adventures.
Now, it’s about time you told us about it, don’t you think?
Oh, yeah, I was in the middle of going through the skills I picked up.
No, that’s not what I’m talking about. We’ll have plenty of chances to see your skills on the rest of the journey, so we can leave that till later. What I’m talking about is what Vanir mentioned, about you having come here from another world.
No, it’s not that serious of a matter… Well, it’s pretty much what it is. I wasn’t born in this world. I came here from another world far away from here. Then, I died. After that, I went to the afterlife and the goddess gave me three options. Either be reborn in my original world as a baby, head on to heaven… or to go to another world.
I see. Was the goddess you met Aqua?
Yep. She was really arrogant when we first met. I wanted to knock her down a peg, so I brought here with me on a whim… 
Megumin, I thought you didn’t believe that Aqua was an actual goddess? Even when she would declare herself as one, you would always throw a few half-hearted platitudes her way…
I didn’t believe her at first, but there were just several things that stuck out. Normally, each person can only be brought back to life once, and getting revived is a high level miracle. But you’ve been brought back several times now. Plus there’s no priest in the world who can purify water with just a touch, survive without issue at the bottom of a lake, and fight a lich and a great devil on their own.
It doesn’t matter what kind of existence she is, Aqua is our precious party member. She cries easily, recovers just as easily, constantly messes up, gets into trouble, and causes problems for Kazuma… but she’s also quick to laughter and brightens up any place just by being there… Yes, no matter what she actually is, Aqua is Aqua, our precious companion.
Kazuma, why does Aqua want to defeat the Demon King so badly? What would happen to Aqua after the Demon King is defeated?
Kazuma, you aren’t going to say you’ll go back to your world after defeating the Demon King, right? You told me you had no intention of going back to your old country, right? After this journey is over, we’ll all go back to town together, right?
… There’s no way I would go home. This world might be weird in a lot of ways, but at the end of the day, I have friends, acquaintances, a house, and enough riches not to be troubled by money in this world… Plus, there’s also, well, umm…
What is it? What are you trying to say?
Go ahead and say it, Kazuma. There’s no need to be shy. What exactly do you have in this world?
A-Adventurers! Monsters have appeared! It’s your time to shine!
What is a horde of Ogres doing in a place like this!?
Megumin, Darkness, we’re lending them a hand too! What kind of aspiring Demon King slayers we are supposed to be if we cower before a few ogres!?
Fine by me! I’ll turn them into dust on the wind in an instant!
Ah, w-wait a minute! Leaving the bare-handed ogre aside, I should really put on my armour if I’m going to be facing armed ogres…!
Dammit, I really do smell the stench of ogre blood!
Which of one you bastards killed our friends!? Show yourself if you have the balls!
It’s the weak-looking thin man in the back! The smell of ogre blood is strong on him!
We’ll take care of the four small ones, so I’ll leave the big bare-handed one to you, Leader!
M-Me alone!? Y-Yes, I understand! Don’t die out there!
Megumin, Megumin, that man got taken out really quickly!
Don’t avert your eyes! In the natural world, the party that averts their gaze first loses!
Hey, thin man, what are you staring at!?
Why did you give up so quickly!? Now they think we are all a bunch of weaklings! See, they are getting closer!
I-I can’t help it! Their faces are really scary!
Look closely, Megumin! This is my true power! Eat this! Fireball!
… Ouch, that’s hot. You have some guts, weak man…
Hey, my magic isn’t working! What’s going on!? Are ogres supposed to be this strong!?
You simply lack magic power! Your class doesn’t provide any sort of boost to your spells, and your magic power is pretty low to start with, so even against an ogre with low magic resistance, that’s the best you can do!
Now it’s my turn! Come fight me fist to fist if you have the balls!
I’m the brainy type, so I’ll have to refuse!
Create Earth Golem!
… Hey, isn’t this a little too small!? This guy barely comes up to my waist! Unlike that fireball, I put a lot of mana into this spell!
You just plain don’t have enough mana! It’s fine, I’m done with my chant! I don’t practice my Explosion every day for no reason! Here I go!
Waaaah, I’m done for!
Explosion!!!
Dammit! Darkness! Darkness! Are you not done yet!?
It’s basic strategy to go for the eyes when facing something stronger than you!
This is why intelligent monsters are–! Go forth, Golem! Your name is–
Die!
They really are utterly useless!
Auto-Evasion activated.
What!?
Please run away! Even a veteran warrior was taken out in a single blow! You weren’t particularly sturdy in the first place, so if it hits you, you’ll definitely suffer a grievous wound!
O-Okay, let’s talk. We can understand each other, so we should be able to come to an agreement.
What is there to talk about when you’ve drenched your entire body in the blood of my brothers!?
K-Kazuma–!
Aah, I should’ve gone all the way with Megumin last night instead of acting cool! I don’t want to die a virgin!
Y-You really are…! How could you say such things right now!?
You’re late! This is why I told you to wear your armour!
B-But, I was worried it might stink if I wear it all the time…!
I’ll kill you!
Darkness, you don’t need to press the attack, all you need to do is buy me enough time to wake up the other adventurers–
K-Kazuma, something is really odd with Darkness! She’s not usually this aggressive!
Hahahahaha! Fuhahahahaha!
Hey, Darkness, why are you laughing like a certain devil!? It’s the armour, isn’t it? That armour is the cause!
Not bad, little lady! Your abdominal muscles seem quite hard too! Would you like to become my woman?
Right, I’m going to slice you into eight pieces!
Eat this! Flash!
Graaaaah!?
Gyaaa! M-My eyes!!!!
W-What are you doing!? How did you blind yourself with your own spell!?
Graah! You dare- urgk…!
Kazuma, I really can’t tell if you are brilliant or stupid.
This is all because of that idiot who ran away from home! She better watch out when I find her!
Say, Cecily, it’s really boring out here.
I feel the same way, Aqua-sama. Let us head back.
Normally, I would’ve agreed with you instantly, but we can’t do that now. Otherwise, the people of this world will continue suffering under the Demon King.
As expected of Aqua-sama. But I understand why you would find this journey tiresome. Why don’t I talk to the driver and call for a little break?
… We can’t do that, Cecily. We haven’t traveled very far from Axel. We already set off late, so if we keep taking breaks like this, Kazuma will catch up easily.
I’m sorry, Aqua-sama. Good women take a lot of time to get ready.
It can’t be helped. There are only good women in the Axis Cult, after all.
Still, this carriage is moving quite slowly, don’t you think? Back when I traveled to Alcanretia with everyone, we didn’t have the time to admire the scenery like this.
That’s because this is the carriage tour meant for sightseeing. Ah, look over there, Aqua-sama! There’s a herd of crabs over there! They are using their tough shells to protect themselves from predation and the heat of the sun! It’s not breeding season yet, so they are probably competing over territory.
You are knowledgeable, Cecily… Wait a minute, this is a sightseeing tour? But I want to get to the Demon King’s castle as fast as possible.
Aqua-sama, there is a reason why I choose the sightseeing carriage. High-end sightseeing tours usually shell out for strong bodyguards in order to ensure the safety of their high paying customers. If something were to happen to an Archpriest as skilled as Aqua-sama, it’d be a loss for the entire world. As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure, so let’s take it easy for this journey.
I see. Well, having strong bodyguards is a good thing. Let’s take our time, then.
And the Axis Cult will be paying the bill, so it’s fine to go with an expensive carriage.
That’s good. It’s nice to ride inside an expensive carriage, they don’t make my butt hurt.
Dear customers, we’ll be stopping the carriage for a while. It seems like a band of ogres are hunting the crabs right now, so we’ll stand by here until they move along.
Say, Cecily, aren’t ogres supposed to be man-eating monsters?
I suppose ogres too occasionally find themselves in the mood to have some crab meat.
I kind of feel like dining on crab too now.
What a coincidence, Aqua-sama, I feel like I’m in the mood for some crab too. After all, a whole herd of crabs is right in front of us.
With that many crabs out there, I’m sure the ogres won’t get angry if you take one or two with you. We have some fairly skilled adventurers in the other carriage, so, what do you say to getting a little closer and grabbing a crab or two?
There’s no need for us to get close. I’ll get the crabs to crawl over with their own legs.
Aqua-sama, might you care to enlighten your humble servant Cecily on what exactly you intend to do?
I plan on luring the crabs over here.
Aqua-sama, that doesn’t tell me anything about what you’re about to do. It’s just my priest’s intuition, but I have a bad feeling–
Using this spell brings back memories! We’ll have a great harvest today! False Fire!
Not a great harvest!
Waaaaaaah! This development brings back memories too, but Kazuma-saaaaan!
I can’t help but like this part of you, Aqua-saaamaaaaa!
Stop causing problems and strip! Do you want me to forcibly strip you!? Stop resisting!
Wait, stop! This is… This is…! What happened to you, Kazuma!? Lusting after my body like a rutting beast in broad daylight…!
I’m telling you to remove that accursed armour! Why do you keep charging straight for every enemy you see!? You’ve been cursed, haven’t you!? That armour of yours is definitely cursed!
There is no such curse! The moment a cursed item is put on, it will stick to its bearer until death! I can remove this armour, so that feeling of excitement whenever I engage in battle isn’t a curse, but a blessing!
So you do know you change your attitude when you enter battle! Then that makes this simple! I don’t care if it is a curse or a blessing, just take it off! Hey, come on, stop fighting me already! I’ll buy the best armour in this city for you in exchange!
No way! How petty can you be to demand something back after offering it as a gift?! This is the first set of armour I received from you, and it’s also a highly enchanted, Crusader exclusive piece of gear! This will become an heirloom of the Dustiness family! Until we defeat the Demon King, the only times I won’t be wearing this is when I’m bathing or sleeping!
Why are you being so stubborn!? You keep charging right into the enemy right off the bat, so we have no chance to use any offensive spells! Do you have any idea how much trouble you caused us on the journey here!? Even the adventurers escorting us were driven to the verge of tears!
Just give up on it, Kazuma. That armour has a weird side effect, but it’s undoubtedly very finely crafted. It might even be powerful enough to rival the strength of a divine relic. She might even be able to withstand a hit from my Explosion with that.
What are you saying now!? Do you really want to let one off so badly!? Do you want to blow Darkness away together with the monsters too!?
I don’t think I would mind that. I lost consciousness the last time I took Megumin’s Explosion, but I won’t lose this time.
Yes, why don’t we use this journey to determine once and for all just which is stronger, my offensive power or your defensive strength.
If you are going to do that sort of thing, wait till we bring Aqua back to Axel first! No, really, stop messing around! If you don’t remove that armour right now, I’m really going to start prying it from you!
Go right ahead.
Eh?
Go ahead and do it. I don’t care.
W-What are you saying? It’s Steal, you know? You are fine with doing that in public? You don’t usually enjoy public humiliation… 
As I am right now, I won’t be laid low by an ounce of humiliation! And, I’m the only one who hasn’t been a victim of your Steal before. I might have given in to you in the past, but with this armour pumping me full of courage, I won’t back down! Now, bring it! If you can really bring yourself to do such an act in public, then go right ahead!
Y-You pervert! When did you become so aggressive!? Do you understand what you are saying!? That armour is really problematic! I get it, I can’t go through with that! I admit defeat, so stop approaching me!
… That’s strange. We’ve caused such a commotion, but no one has come out to investigate. Almost all of the residents of this city should be of the Axis Cult, and most Axis cultists are innately curious, easily drawn to commotions, and enjoy fanning the flames of chaos. With you threatening to strip Darkness’s clothes off in the middle of the street, they should be all over you like moths to a flame.
Now that you mention it, yeah, that is odd. They were all about soliciting new recruits the last time we were here, but now…
This is a pretty big city, so why are there so few people around? Did something happen?
Let’s go ask around about what happened. We’ll have to arrange a carriage for the road ahead anyways.
Welcome! What will you have? Today’s lunch special comes with a dessert, and I highly recommend that. By the way, Axis Cultists enjoy a 30% discount in this store. Please take this with you!
… Er, well, I’ll take the lunch special.
I’ll take a neroid and a sandwich.
Roger that!
I’ll have, hmm…
You can go eat dirt.
Please keep your Eris pendant hidden while you’re in this city.
… I-I refuse…
… Still, even though it’s lunchtime, this place is almost empty. With all the crazy folks here, I thought it would be far more lively …
Under the orders of Zesta-sama, most of the Axis Cultists have left to clear out the monsters on the path between this city and the Demon King’s castle.
So the Axis Cult will actually do philanthropic works?
Please don’t think of us as a group that does nothing other than seek enjoyment and cause trouble for others. The bad rumours about us are all spread by those heartless Eris Cultists.
… By the way, what are you doing here?
Now that most of the Axis Cult is away, it is the perfect chance for those few Eris cultists in this city to come here to make trouble. It might be because we pushed things a little too far on a daily basis.
So you do understand that your daily behaviors are outrageous! No, wait, will you really be fine alone?
Don’t worry, if any apostates show up, I’ll take care of them with this big, thick, hard mace.
D-Don’t do that! That’ll just increase the bad rumours surrounding the Axis Cult! … By the way, did an Archpriest named Aqua come to this city? I originally wanted to ask around about her, but thanks to a certain someone, we couldn’t get any proper information.
Ah, yes, Aqua-sama did come here! She even timidly asked ‘I turned your hot springs into water the last time I was here, are you still angry about that?’. Ah, Aqua-sama is too cute! Actually, the reason why everyone is out at the moment is because of Aqua-sama’s request. Aaah, I wanted to go hunt some monsters too…! If only I didn’t lose that round of rock paper scissors…
They are hunting monsters on Aqua-sama’s orders? What does that mean? Please tell me more about that.
Aqua-sama said ‘Devout Axis cultists who follow my teachings, I wish for you, strong and gallant as you are, to clear out the monsters infesting the path between the Demon King’s castle and this city so that travellers may freely pass through. As a reward for your efforts, after the Demon King has been defeated, a certain travelling Axis priest might visit this temple and reveal herself to be Aqua-sama. She might even give praise and thanks to every single participant.'
… The Axis Cult figured out Aqua’s true identity a long time ago…
Isn’t that obvious? Our sharp and observant eyes would never miss something so blatant.
Didn’t you guys call her a fraud and throw stones at her the last time she was in town?
That must be the work of Eris cultists posing as us. I don’t have the slightest recollection of that incident at all.
Um, was Aqua alone? Did you see a handsome warrior with a magic sword or a Crimson Demon with very little presence with her?
Ah, there was someone like that. When I was seeing Aqua-sama off to the entrance of the city, I saw a handsome man with a very expensive-looking sword arrive onboard a very expensive-looking carriage. It’s almost like he appeared in front of me precisely because I lost a lot of money in an investment. I used my amazing gaze of seduction, but he wasn’t moved at all.
So Aqua met up with them… By the way, is there any place here to rent a carriage? It doesn’t matter if it’s a little expensive. The faster, the better.
The horses owned by our church are probably the fastest horses in this city… But couldn’t you dogs of Eris just run out on all fours? That’d be most fitting for the followers of that evil… Ah!? You apostate, what are you doing!
Sorry, but could you lend them to us? If you need payment…
May the blessings of Aqua-sama go with you!
Hey, Darkness, I know we are in a rush and all, but aren’t we going a little too fast? I think it’s fine to slow down a little. The Axis Cult might have done their work, but it’s not like this path is completely free of monsters, you know? What are you going to do if a monster suddenly jumps out?
Um, Darkness…? I think we are going a little too fast too. I know you are worried about Aqua, but if you press them too hard, you’ll ride the horses into the ground.
Hey, did you hear me? We are going too fast. Slow down a little…
… The horses aren’t listening to me…
I’ve heard that in Alcanretia, even the horses have been brainwashed by the Axis Cult. So they won’t listen to anyone outside the Axis Cult…
Stoooooop!
Ah, Kazuma, look, there’s an Axis Cult enlistment form in the corner of the carriage! We’ve been had! That Axis Cultist tricked us!
Aaah, dammit! Instead of fighting the Demon King, we should wipe out the Axis Cult first!
K-Kazuma, for the sake of all of us, please sign this piece of paper…!
C-Come on, listen to me! Hyah! Hyah! If you listen to me, I’ll give you some fresh hay later! Soft, lively, freshly cut hay!
Aah, there’s someone ahead! Kazuma, what should we do!? At this rate we’ll run straight over them!
Just head towards them.
Don’t worry about it, Darkness, just keep going.
M-Megumin!?
It’s fine. Actually, it’s best to charge straight into them! After all, those people are…!
Oh, hey, Megumin-san! It has been some time! Do you remember me!? I’m the patriarch of the Axis Cu–!
Heal! Heal! … How do you feel? Is it better now?
Yes, it feels much better now. Though you needn’t have done that, I could’ve healed myself. Still, receiving a heal casted by a young one sure is refreshing. Not only is my body healed, but my soul is as well!
As expected of the ‘anything goes’ Zesta-sama! You really are hardcore!
‘As long as there is a hole, even an orc is fine’ is Zesta-sama’s moniker, after all! So cool!
It has been some time, Megumin-san. Still, I didn’t expect such a violent greeting from you. It would seem like the only choices you have now is to either join the Axis Cult or go steady with me as an apology.
Just so you know, the horses that ran into you were the ones we borrowed from the Axis Cult. Please don’t do weird things to the horses too.
I’ve heard many things about you, Kazuma-dono! You may call me Zesta, papa, darling, father, or whatever else you would like.
Hey, Megumin, why are all the people you know all shot in the head?
It’s not like I know him because I want to! Actually, Kazuma, you should be careful of him. Don’t let him lead you astray.
You’re quite handsome, aren’t you!? Say, can I call you Onii-chan?
You can’t do that! Sure, he’s handsome and all, but you can’t call someone who’s not a member of the Axis Cult onii-chan… I understand you want to fawn over him, but you need to act like a proper member of the Axis Cult. Ah, what a shame…
I get it… Say, Onii-chan, do you hate the Axis cult?
Umm… can I call you Onii-sama?
Of course not! You’re a guy! You Axis Cultists are really down for anything!?
Not at all! I’m just fine with both sides, just like Zesta-sama!
Enough, just stop talking! We have our hands full with just our masochistic Crusader!
Eeh!?
You seemed to have gone through a lot… say, have you slimmed down?
Oh shut up… Tsk, what are you doing here? There are only fortresses and villages used as supply depots for the front lines up ahead. It’s no place for you to be… Aaah, this is the worst! I got wrapped up in some weird cult, and now I run into the one person I don’t ever want to see!
Kuh, what are you trying to do with a body as sexy as yours!? Just what city and which sect do you hail from!? Name yourself!
Yeah, we’ll be paying your church a visit soon, so tell us!
Ah! You can see this woman’s bra from the back! Judging from their size, she shouldn’t be part of the Eris Church…
No, wait, a recent paper stated that there is no relation between the sect a person is in and their development. So, for the purpose of statistical research, you must tell me which sect you’re from! Specifically, which city your church is in, and what time would you be present!? We won’t head over to hand over a declaration of war or anything, so don’t worry about that!
… Y-You guys better stop messing around…
… How should I say this, I didn’t expect to run into you so soon too. But that’s just as well, I have a few things to ask you. I’m still angry over you killing me, but if you answer my questions, I can let you go for now.
Aaah!
What kind of stupidity are you spouting? Why must I answer any of your questions? Or are you trying to owe me another favour? I no longer want to make you my puppet… Hey, what are you guys doing!? Wait-stop! What are you trying to do by digging up my spit!?
… Phew. Well, it would seem that my companions have shown you a truly unseemly sight. My apologies, young lady.
You are not in a position to say that! Actually, it’s really creepy, so toss that out already! In the first place, what kind of people are you!? You’ve been doing as you please for a while now, but none of you have formed a bond of debt towards me! After sexually harassing me for so long, you should’ve at least felt a little thankful!
Thankful? Of course we are thankful. Thankful to our goddess! Ah, our good fortune today must be the result of our daily devotion…! Ah, I’m not worthy…!
Just what is wrong with this insane group!? Ahh, this is messing with my head! Actually, Kazuma, how are you still here? Didn’t I cast Death on you… Hey, stop trying to peek up my skirt, old man! If you don’t cut it out, I’ll kill you!
You know our priest, Aqua, right? Her only good point is her skill as a priest. She brought me back to life… Anyway, I have several questions for you.
Like I said, I have no reasons to answer any of your questions. Or what, do you intend to force the answers out of me? My level may have been lowered, but I’m still strong enough to take care of everyone present… Plus, that skilled priest of yours isn’t here right now. So what do you think? Do you want to go?
Still, Aqua, you called her? I should’ve killed her first instead of going for you. Ah, I really messed up then-
What did you just say?
I’m saying that I should’ve taken care of that retarded girl named Aqua from the start… So, what are you going to do, Kazuma? I’m about to reach my limits soon. Why don’t you try begging for your life? I know you are a troublesome opponent to fight. It’d be a chore to take you down, so if you get down on all fours and beg for your life, I might consider letting you go. Ah, but–
I won’t let these people off. They seem to be your acquaintances, but they push things too far. Now that we are this close to the Demon King’s castle, there won’t be any knights riding to your rescue. So, what will you do?
Kazuma-dono, would you mind properly introducing this young lady to me?
Go ahead and introduce me. After all, they are not long for this world. Let them know my true identity and curse their fortunes before they die.
She is a Dark Priest who worships the dark goddess Regina, the Demon King’s General Serena. She gave Aqua a really hard time in Axel and is one of the main reasons why she ran away from home.
And these are the infamous Axis Cult from Alcanretia, and their patriarch, Zesta.
String her up! String her up!
Noooooooo!!
I-I-I’m sorry! Please forgive me! I didn’t know! I-I-I didn’t know that girl was a goddess!
Huh? That girl? You dare refer to our great as glorious goddess as ‘That girl’?
Eeep! I-I-I’m sorry!
U-Umm, sorry, but I have a few questions I wish to ask of her. Those questions concern Aqua’s safety, so can you please leave her in my care for a few minutes?
K-Kazuma-! He… Help me! I’ll answer anything you want, so help me! We were once both followers of Regina, weren’t we!? I’ve fulfilled all of your selfish requests and even did side jobs to let you live in luxury! I mean, we got into a fight at the end, but we are still close friends who’ve spent a lot of time living under the same roof- Ouch! It hurts, cut it out! Hey, cut it out! What are you doing!?
O-Oh right! If you kill me now, Regina-sama’s curse will ensure that you will all go down with me! Regina-sama is the Goddess of Vengeance! Anything you do to me will be returned back to you! This isn’t a bluff! If you understand that, then let me down already! I’ll die if I fall from this high up! If I do, everyone who bound me and strung me up here will die as well!
What of it?
You seem to have some kind of misunderstanding. We are of the Axis faith. When we die, we’ll be sent straight to the side of Aqua-sama. Yes, right to the feet of our beloved Aqua-sama! And then, and then… ! After we die, we’ll be reincarnated in the world that Aqua-sama presides over! Yes, the paradise known as Japan!
Eh?
Japan. That’s the dream-like paradise of a country that Aqua-sama told us about. In that place, even a man like me who swings both ways can live freely… And that’s only the tip of the iceberg! The place is overflowing with many special books that appeal to all kinds of interests! It’s a world where we who are decried as perverts and heretics can lead an unrestrained life!
Even someone like me who enjoys dressing as a woman can live without worry there! I’ve heard that they call people like me ‘otoko no ko’…!
That is a world with no hunger and little strife, where one does not need to live in fear of monsters. Furthermore… It is said that books of handsome men getting into intimate relations of all kinds are sold freely there…! And, and… even books concerning little boys… Ah, I’m glad I joined the Axis Cult! I’m so happy to be alive…!
Y-You damn maniacs…!
… Now then.
Would you mind answering Kazuma-dono’s questions?
Right, why don’t you give me some more specific information regarding the Demon King’s army? How many troops will be left behind to guard the Demon King’s castle? What are its defences like? And, of course, tell me everything you know about the demon king himself.
Judging from the date, the Demon King’s daughter would have already led the bulk of the army away on the offensive. In other words, there aren’t any generals defending the castle right now. But there is a reason for that.
Some time ago, back when Wiz just became a lich, she forcibly broke through the barrier and penetrated deep into the castle. After that, the most senior Demon King’s general at the time voluntarily retired in order to keep a constant watch over.
The most senior Demon King’s general, huh? That sounds like a pretty strong person. How does he fight? Does he have any weaknesses?
He won’t be easy to take down. He’s created a magic circle that allows him to draw mana directly from the demonic realm. Though he is no longer able to stray far from the castle, as long as he’s on the castle grounds, he’s able to draw upon a tremendous amount of mana. Any wounds he suffers can be healed almost instantly, and he can cast a powerful barrier on himself that makes him practically invulnerable. On top of that, he’s a powerful spellcaster. If you attack the castle head on, he’ll just blast you with an endless stream of long range magic, and that’ll be the end of it.
How do you defeat someone like that? Is there a way to go around him somehow?
It is impossible to defeat him. You won’t be able to break through his barrier without some serious firepower, and even if you do manage to wound him, there’s no way to keep up with his regeneration. Even if the barrier around the castle isn’t there, it would probably take all the Crimson Demons casting their most powerful spells on him to even seriously inconvenience him. As for going around him, well… you might be able to sneak a small force in somehow, but breaking through the barrier with magic will definitely draw a lot of attention. Either way, you’ll definitely be discovered and get taken out.
In a certain sense, he might be more troublesome to face than the Demon King himself. To my knowledge, he is the strongest mage in the world.
Now then, about the Demon King himself-
I refuse.
I’m going to be executed after this anyway, right? So that’s all the information I’ll provide. Unless you wish to make another deal with me? In that case, my condition is to be set free. If you can agree to that, I’ll give you information about the Demon King in exchange.
Do you really think you are in a position to be demanding terms? Right now, those maniacs behind me are just chomping at the bit to torture you, you know? If you send me away–
Go right ahead. Torture and the likes won’t work on me. After all, anything that gets done to me will be returned to the torturer. Now, if you want to kill me, go ahead! As long as you don’t mind me taking what I know to the grave!
… In that case, leave the rest to me.
I’m confident that I won’t give in to mere pain! Allow me to give you a full body workout, and whoever screams first is the loser! Let’s start with something intense… No, we should start with…
H-Hey, cut it out, you pervert! Ah, hey! What are you planning on doing by removing my shoes… Hey. No wait, wait! What are you doing with my pinky toe!? Where did you get that brick from? Stop! What are going to do with that brick!?
I just had a divine revelation!
Eh!?
I just realized something really amazing. This must be a revelation sent to me by Aqua-sama herself…
Zesta-sama, is something wrong?
Zesta-sama, what exactly are you thinking?
Young lady of the Regina cult, any damage done to you will be reflected as is to the person who dealt the damage… Is that right?
Eh? Ah, yes, that is true…
Then allow me to ask you one more question. Are you a virgin?
That’s a really bold question! … At the end of the day, I’m still a servant of the divine. You understand what I’m saying, right?
Aaah, how could this be!? That means, even a man like me… ! When I take the innocence of this Regina cultist…! At that moment, even a man like me can know the pain of getting deflowered! This is truly a divine miracle to allow such unique experiences to be shared…!
What are you saying!? I don’t understand! I don’t want to understand!
Zesta-sama, p-please give this chance to me! I want to truly experience what it feels to be a girl!
That’s not fair! You are always taking the best parts for yourself, Zesta-sama!
Me too, me too! There’s no way such a rare and unique chance will come around again!
Hey, wait, wait, stop! I-I’m going to be… Kazuma! Kazuma! I apologize! It’s all my fault! I’ll tell you everything, so please stop them!
Power! Protection! Blessing! … I shall be the one to take that Regina cultist’s purity! If any one of you think you can defeat me as I am right now, go ahead and come right at me!
That’s low, Zesta-sama! Using the blessings of Aqua-sama for such an endeavour is really dirty of you!
Coward! Scum! You’re abusing your powers as an Archpriest!
So, Serena, I know of a way that will probably save you, so hurry up and tell me everything you know about the Demon King. If you do, I promise I’ll do my best to help you get out of this.
R-R-Really!? You really can get me away from those maniacs!? I can trust you on this, right!?
The Demon King himself is… Due to his advanced age, he isn’t very strong in direct combat… But his special ability that comes with his lineage is extremely powerful. You could even say he became the Demon King solely due to how strong his ability is.
… Special ability?
Yes, special ability. Just like all those people with strange names like you, the Demon King has a powerful ability of his own. If you are a monster or a demon, you’ll receive a massive power boost just by being in his presence. With him present, even a lowly goblin will be able to go toe to toe with an experienced adventuring party, at least.
What kind of cheat is that?
On top of that, the Demon King can also bestow his protection upon his underlings. You’ve fought with the Dullahan, Beldia before, right? I’m sure you’ve noticed that he was especially resistant to holy magic.
… It think it’s best if you give up on taking down the Demon King. If you really want to, your best chance of success is to resort to ambushing him while his minions are away or other similar tactics… Plus, most of his powers have already been transferred to his daughter. That is the reason why she’s personally heading to the capital with the greater portion of the Demon King’s army. As the Demon King is right now, even if he were to lead the army, he won’t be able to dramatically increase their combat prowess… But he is still powerful enough to boost the power of anyone in the same room as him. As long as he is around, it’s best to assume that every single member of his elite guard is as strong as a Demon King’s General.
Hey, that’s enough information, right? I’ve already told you pretty much everything I know about the Demon King. The only other things I know about him are stuff like how he really dotes on his daughter, or he is really having a headache dealing with matters of human resources–
Ah, no, that’ll be fine. Those guys seem like they’ve pretty much decided things too.
Hahaha! Oh, great Aqua-sama, I offer my heroic deeds to your glory! Behold, I have taken care of all of the rebellious heretics!
You damn old man, how could you treat your own faithful as heretics!?
Don’t get full of yourself just because you can use a little magic! We have the blessings of Aqua-sama too! Get him!
So, have you concluded your business yet? I think it’s about time you hand that heretic over to us.
Eep!
Kazuma… K-K-K-Kazuma…!
Are you willing to turn over a new leaf and let go of everything you have now to worship, revere, and respect the goddess Aqua as a devout Axis Cultist?
S-Seriously…?
–Hey, underling, stop moping around! We’re leaving!
Y-Yes! Sorry, senpai!
Senpai does have a nice ring to it…! Call me senpai too!
Eeep! W-What is it, S-Senpai…!
Hey, underling! Don’t get too comfortable! We aren’t going to pamper you! For now, go buy enough neroid for everyone! I want the limited edition hell spicy-sweet neriod.
S-Senpai… It’s almost winter now…
Did you say something?
No, I didn’t! I’ll go buy some right now! I’ll go around to various cities to get enough for everyone!
Well, all’s well that ends well.
What exactly ended well!?
Now then, Kazuma-dono, shall we hit the road?
– Darkness, please squeeze in a little more. You take up a lot of space with all the bits popping out of you. Can’t you make yourself a little more compact?
I-It’s not like I grew up this way because I wanted to… Besides, you are a little too compact- ow! Ah, ah, Megumin, don’t pull on my hair…!
Ha ha ha! Now now, flat and bountiful both have their own appeal. You shouldn’t fight over that. If you really must settle things cleanly, allow me to judge as a neutral party. Go ahead and show me your bare chests–
Hey, old man, stop harassing my companions. That’s a privilege only I can have. Otherwise I’m going to throw you off this carriage. While it’s still moving.
If you keep saying stupid things, I’m going to throw both of you out… Say, Megumin, is it really fine to bring this man along with us? There’s no need to specifically bring this man along just to control the horses, right? Couldn’t we bring along some other Axis Cultist?
What are you saying? I might not seem like much, but I can confidently say that I’m the strongest person in the Axis Cult. I assure you, I’ll deliver you to Aqua-sama in one piece.
Ah, the warmth of a young man. What a great reward! Thank you, Aqua-sama!
Please, just shut up. Say, Megumin, Darkness, is there really no way we can change seats?
N-No way. I feel like I’ll end up getting harassed.
Y-Yeah. I’m used to getting harassed by you, but getting it from that man is a little… 
Now then, we should get going. I’ll leave the rest to you, my followers!
Understood. We’ll be praying that Zesta-sama will be able to be of aid to Aqua-sama in our place.
Bye, Serena. I think it’d be best for you to get used to living in the Axis Cult as soon as possible.
Shut up. Hurry up and go already you embodiment of ill luck!
This really was a surprise, Aqua-sama. To think that we would end up running into each other.
It’s been some time, Magic Sword Man. It really is a coincidence, running into you here–
Yunyun-san! Yunyun-san! Thank you for saving me, Yunyun-san! Let onee-chan give you a big hug as thanks!
Isn’t that what you always do, Cecily-san!?
To think we’d happen to run into each other just as Aqua-sama got into a crisis. This must be what they call fate–
Yunyun-san, help yourself to the crabs. Thanks to Aqua-sama, we got a lot of them today. We’ll have a crab feast!
You shouldn’t do that, Cecily-san. Mitsurugi-san is being serious… Feast… A feast with everyone… Everyone… 
everyone
N-No, we can’t hold a feast here. Plus, we defeated the ogres. Ogres have a very strong bond of kinship towards each other. Others will definitely come around here to investigate their lost companions before too long. In the first place, we came out to aid Aqua-sama in her efforts to take out the Demon King. Now that we have met up, we should make haste towards the Demon King’s castle…
Y-Yeah, that’s right! A feast… isn’t something that we should be doing now… 
How can we not have a feast!? Aqua-sama wants to eat crab meat, you know!? Even if you are handsome, there’s no way I can’t go along with that request!
You are… Cecily-san, right? We met at the church in Alcanretia, haven’t we?
Have we met before? … Oh, yeah, you were the guy who hit on me back at Alcanretia when you were looking for a priest, right!?
I didn’t hit on you! Moreover, all I wanted was a priest of the Axis Cult, not you in particular…
Aqua-sama, my apologies for not explaining things earlier… We came after you in order to offer our aid in your quest to defeat the Demon King. When I had my fortune told by the foremost fortune teller amongst the Crimson Demons, she told me ‘you will run into a priest of the Axis Cult in the near future. She will be a key figure in deciding the fate of this world. No matter what happens, you must protect her.’ … In other words, this is…!
Aqua-sama, a younger, handsome man just proposed to me!
That isn’t about you, Cecily-san! Ah, wait, Aqua-sama–
Aqua-sama, Aqua-sama, your humble servant Cecily has something to confess.
Cecily, where did this come from? I don’t know exactly what you did, but I’m sure it’s not a big deal. If you want, I can come with you to apologize.
Really, Aqua-sama? You see, I’ve angered quite a few people… Ah, no, that’s not what I want to say.
Aqua-sama, the truth is, I’ve been delaying our journey in order to allow Megumin-san and the others to catch up, but it seems like this is as far as that will go. I’ve actually brought a few games to attract your attention, but at this rate, we’ll be at Alcanretia within an hour.
I’m a little curious as to why exactly you delayed us, but I’m sure you had a good reason for doing that. First that ghost girl, and now you. Why does everyone want to delay me? … But very well, I forgive you.
With this party, it might be possible to take down the Demon King, but personally, I hope–
Ah, it’d be boorish of me to say anything more. As a low-leveled priest, I would only hold you back going forward. When you reach Alcanretia, you must pay the headquarters a visit. When you do, you should give Zesta-sama and the others this order…
Now then, your humble servant Cecily prays for your success! This is but a small offering, but it’s the best a lowly priest like me can do… May the protection of Aqua-sama be on you! Blessing!
Say, old man, I’m really thankful for you taking the helm, but your breathing is a little too rough, you know?
Don’t mind it, this is just a natural reaction.
Of course I would mind! You really go with anything, don’t you!? … Hey, wait, what’s that over there?
… Geh, it’s a manticore. Hey, old man, let’s make a detour. There was a fork in the road not too far back, wasn’t there? Let’s use that path instead.
No, let us continue as is.
Are you insane? That guy is seriously strong, you know? I don’t know how strong you are, but–
Allow me to show you the strength of the Axis Cult. A single Manticore won’t even be a speed bump.
Eeh!? No, wait, I mean, do you know what the most dangerous part of a Manticore is? Those things will relentlessly go after your backyard with that stinger of theirs. I almost ascended the stairs of adulthood when I ran into one in the past.
I’m looking forward to that!
What did you just say!? We don’t need another pervert in our party, Darkness alone is enough!
W-Wait, Kazuma, I might be headstrong, but I still feel hurt if you say something like that.
It’ll be fine, Kazuma. Leaving his failings as a proper human aside, his skill as an Archpriest is unmatched. I guarantee it.
… Really? Well, if you would go that far, I’ll trust you, but…
Wha–?
Aaah! It ran away!
What is going on!? Why is the manticore running away!?
To the Axis Cult, as long as it isn’t a devil or undead, all creatures can be loved. As the patriarch of the Axis Cult, I too am the apostle of love. Even if it is a monster, I shall donate my love equally to all parties… But recently, for some reason, they’ve been fleeing the moment they meet my eyes…
Just how hated are the Axis Cult!? Actually, old man, you really are fine with anything, aren’t you!?
Darkness, look! The migratory crabs over there are performing their mating ritual. Tightly grasping their partners with their pincers is an expression of love for them.
I-Is that so? Why did you bring that up out of the blue…
Hey, don’t think you can distract me! Didn’t you guarantee that I can count on this man’s abilities!? We’re heading back to Alcanretia and trading him for someone else!
I said we can count on his abilities as an Archpriest! I said nothing about him as a person! If we could’ve gotten someone else, I would’ve already done it!
Hey, you two, if you keep saying such things, I won’t keep silent. Sealing your mouths with my own isn’t a particularly tough thing to do for me.
As a member of the Axis cult, I have a dream… when this world is finally at peace… I would like to see a world where the boundaries of gender and species are torn down too… 
That sounds like a noble idea, but I can’t get behind it when you are the one saying it!
As expected of Aqua-sama, that was a really brilliant support spell. Thank you very much.
You’re welcome. Is anyone injured?
Everything is fine, Aqua-sama. Thanks to your protection, no one was injured this time either. Thank you for your concern.
Good work, Kyouya. Things are really easy with an Archpriest and an Archwizard around!
Yeah, yeah, we didn’t get the chance to do anything at all.
With this party, we have nothing to fear, even if we are facing the Demon King. Aqua-sama, let’s continue on! We shall bring peace back to this world!
Ah, yes.
Listen to this, Aqua-san! Wiz-san just contacted me from Axel, and she said Kazuma-san has left to catch up with us!
Oh?
Aqua-san, you seem happy.
Not particularly. So, is Kazuma coming after us alone?
No, Darkness-san and Megumin are together with him. Umm, when I left town, the other adventurers were worried about you, you know? They said that if they manage to run into you, they’ll definitely lecture you until you’re in tears. Megumin was especially agitated.
… Is that so?
Um, well, I’m a little worried that Kazuma might end up getting eaten by a stray frog or something on the way. He already likes to die at the drop of a hat like he’s playing Spelunker, and now that he’s been reduced to level one, I really doubt that he’ll be able to lead the other two and safely catch up with us.
He will be fine! Kazuma-san went with Wiz-san and Vanir-san to the dungeons to level up! He’s learned various skills and awoken to his true power, or something! … By the way, what’s spelunker?
Hey, what do you mean by that? I haven’t heard a single thing about it! What do you mean he awakened!? What kinds of skills did he learn!? I have a really bad feeling that my role has been stolen! Such a cool event like awakening doesn’t suit Kazuma at all! He’s the kind of person who loses his life against trash mobs and only manages to win against strong foes through underhanded tactics! Why did such an interesting event happen when I was away!?
I-I-I can’t do anything e-e-even if you ask me! Aqua-san, please don’t shake me! I left town before Kazuma-san left to train, so I don’t know the details! There are a lot of limitations to long range magical communications, so…! I only heard that most of the adventurers in Axel agreed to coach Kazuma and teach him all kinds of skills… So, anyway, what’s a spelunker?
Shall we go home?
What are you saying, Aqua-sama!? Didn’t you say that this is the perfect chance!? That with their forces our attacking the capital and the town of Axel, the defences at the castle will be thin!? Please trust me, I’ll definitely defeat the Demon King! Or are you really that worried about that man!?
Calm down, Mitsurugi-san. Wouldn’t it be fine if we wait for Kazuma-san and the others to catch up before heading towards the Demon King’s castle? We will have greater strength when it comes time to attack the castle, and it’d put Aqua-san at ease too.
… Let’s carry on, Aqua-sama. I understand that you are worried for that man, but the fate of the world is at stake here. Please remember why you set out on this journey. Weren’t you going to take this opportunity where the Demon King is at his most vulnerable to defeat him and everyone in this world who cannot defend themselves? … Don’t worry, I’ll be by your side the entire way… 
No matter what happens, I’ll protect you. I will become your reliable shield. I shall become your strongest sword that will wipe away all that stands in your way. So, could you rely on me instead of that man…?
Aqua-san, is something wrong? Ever since we left Alcanretia, you’ve been listless…
It’s nothing. It’s just, things are going smoothly, aren’t they? Back when I was traveling with Kazuma and the others, it was more, how do I put it, chaotic? We ran into crisis after crisis each day. Of course, I’m not saying that it’s a good thing, but, well…
Ah, come to think of it, what did you do in Alcanretia? You followed Cecily-san’s suggestions and went to the cathedral, right?
Ah, that? Well, you see–!
Hey, what’s keeping them? It’s already been quite some time since I set off, so why hasn’t Kazuma caught up with us yet?
T-That’s, um, well… We must be going too fast for them to catch up. Mitsurugi-san, perhaps it would be best for us to wait here for a while…?
… We can’t do that. Even while we are resting here, the Demon King’s army is making progress with their invasion plans. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising for Axel to be attacked any time now. If that happens, the citizens of the town will surely suffer. In order to avoid any further casualties, we should defeat the Demon King as soon as we can… Plus, that man is a good-for-nothing who abandoned Aqua-sama before. And a man like that wants to take on the Demon King…!
… This is bad, Yunyun! I want to put in a good word for Kazuma, but thinking about it, I can’t come up with any good points about him at all!
A-Aqua-san, you can’t say such things out loud! Kazuma-san would be really heartbroken if he heard that!
Aqua-sama, please rest here for a while. I’ll ask the villagers for details regarding the next leg of our journey.
… He does have a lot of negative traits, but I think he has some positive traits too. No matter what kind of complex issue you bring to him, he will always find a way to resolve it. At the end of the day, Kazuma is the most reliable person I know.
W-Why didn’t you say that earlier?
A-Aqua-san, everyone’s staring! A grown woman like you shouldn’t do stupid stuff in public!
A-Aqua-san, what should we do with all these tips…!? Actually, is it really fine to leave just like that after putting everyone in such a lively mood…?
It’s fine. And I don’t need tips. I’m not a busker, so I can’t accept that. Is there a branch of the Axis Cult here? Just donate all those tips to them… 
I wonder what’s going on? The atmosphere seems quite heavy.
Let’s go check it out. If they are having problems with the water, that’d be the perfect chance for me to step in.
P-Please wait. Um, I’ll go ask them for the details first! I mean, you always end up getting involved in strange problems, so I’m sure this time too…!
Just who do you think I am? It’ll be fine, Yunyun. If it’s a problem with water, you can count on the Axis Cult! And if an Archpriest of the Axis Cult like me were to handle it, the problem is as good as resolved!
Aqua-san, I have a really bad feeling about this! Ah, please wait!
Are you having some problems with the water? I’m just a travelling Archpriest of the Axis Cult that happened to pass by. If you mention water, you think about the Axis Cult!
A-Axis Cult!?
H-Hey, is it that Axis Cult? It’s best not to get involved…
Er, you see, it appears that our reservoir has been polluted. A brood of young brutal alligators have started making their nest nearby because of that. Those creatures will release a powerful toxin into their surroundings when wounded, so it’s hard for us to deal with them. These creatures dislike clean water, so if the reservoir is purified, they should migrate elsewhere on their own, but… 
Ah, I see. That’s a big problem. Now then, if you’ll excuse me…
Aqua-san, where are you going!? What happened to all that spirit from before!?
Let go of me, Yunyun! I have really bad memories concerning those alligators! It’s just like you said earlier, I have a really bad feeling about this…!
I-I get it, I get it! You’ll trip if you run like that so–Ah!
Ah!
Sorry, Aqua-san! I’ll pull you out right now… Ah! The alligators are approaching! Please hold on for a while! I’ll take out the alligators first!
W-Wait a minute! We’d be really thankful to have them taken care off, but if you take them out here our precious water source will be contaminated!
T-That’s right! Let’s put our heads together and think of another way! Someone bring an oar or something! We need to pull that lady out!
Stop discussing and decide if you are going to take them out or pull me out! Actually, why are they gathering around me!?
Waaaaah! I’m sorry for running away, so please save me, Kazuma-san!
… This village feels odd. It’s like, I don’t feel the tension of being at a frontline village at all.
I wonder what happened? Shouldn’t everyone be more on guard? It wouldn’t be surprising for a small village like this to be wiped off the map at any time.
That priest really seemed like a goddess, didn’t she!?
Yeah! To think that she would risk her own body to purify our one and only reservoir! You don’t run into such heroic folks these days!
Pardon me, could you please tell me more about that?
Well, you see, our reservoir got polluted, and brutal alligators started moving in. Just then, a beautiful priest happened to pass by and risked her own body to purify the water and chase away the alligators.
Hmm, must have been someone else.
Yeah, I don’t recall knowing such an exemplary priest.
Indeed. It must have been someone else.
I-If you continue to disrespect my goddess, I’ll deliver divine punishment upon you in her stead!
She was a priest of the Axis Cult with long, blue hair. She fell into the water, screamed a panicked chant of some sort, and before I knew it, the reservoir was filled with clean water.
That’s definitely Aqua.
That’s Aqua.
Indeed, that’s most definitely Aqua.
You three… No, I think I’ll hold my tongue here…
Aah, that priest? We tried to warn her that it was dangerous, but she left with a few companions in the direction of the Demon King’s castle. That was a few hours ago.
A few hours ago!?
… W-What? Why are the two of you grinning like that?
No, I just thought you seemed especially happy. Recently, your complaints and retorts have lost their edge, so I thought that you might finally go back to usual with this.
Fufu, stop it Megumin. This man can’t be honest, after all. If you keep talking, he might start coming up with excuses again.
Right, I’m using Drain Touch on you the moment we get back to Axel. You won’t be able to cast Explosion for three days. As for you, Darkness, one of these days, I’m going to swap out the oil you use for polishing your armour with cooking oil. Now, let’s hurry on!
K-K-K-Kazuma!? You’re joking, right? T-That’s way to much! You don’t need to regain your brutishness too!
Y-Yeah, that’s not funny! … Kazuma, you’re joking, right? P-Please tell me you’re joking. I’ve already given a name to this armour. Y-you wouldn’t actually do that, right?
… What happened?
I’m at a loss. The horses appear to be frightened. It seems like we are quite close to the Demon King’s castle.
… Is that their carriage?
They must be close by. Alright, let’s pursue them on foot. It’s Aqua we are talking about, so she’ll most likely get cold feet and start dallying about the moment she lays eyes on the Demon King’s castle… Old man, thank you for leading us here. You’ve been a great help. We’ll take it from here, so you can go back before us.
Hmm? I think it would be safer if I were to stick with you. Besides, how could I miss out on heading straight into the Demon King’s headquarters? That sounds way too fun.
If worst comes to worst, we can escape using Teleport. But Teleport can only transport four people at once. Even if we were to meet up with Yunyun, they have a party of five people there. With the three of us here, we make up a party of eight people. Between Yunyun and me, we can make a quick escape… Though, if you don’t mind us leaving you behind in a moment of crisis…
I’ll be eagerly awaiting your good news at Alcanretia! Now then, I shall take my leave!
Seeya, old man. Don’t go too overboard with the sexual harassment now.
That would get rid of eighty percent of my meaning for existence… Ah, please wait for a moment.
Power! Protection! … And lastly, Blessing!
I will be praying for your success. May the blessings of Aqua-sama be with you…!
… Ah!? When I checked my bag, one of my underwear is missing!?
Eh!? … Ah, one of mine is gone too!
Hey, Kazuma, the bodies are still warm. Aqua and the others couldn’t have gone far…!
Please wait~! The rucksack… The rucksack is really heavy! Please don’t leave me behind!
We are about to have an emotional reunion with our companion, so stop spoiling the mood! Just throw that stuff out by the roadside!
I refuse!
Grah, just hand it over! I’ll carry it for you! Seriously, here I thought you were somewhat cool earlier, but … Ah? What did you put in this, weights to help in muscle training!? You knew that we’d be traveling, so you should’ve packed lightly!? Just what did you bring with you!?
… T-That’s a foreboding sight…
… Y-Yeah…
S-So cool…!
I-I found her!
Eh!?
Aqua! Hey! Heeeey! Hey, Aqua!… Ah, dammit!
Wait wait wait! Kazuma, what are you trying to do!?
I know you want to shoot an arrow close by, but what if end up shooting her in the head by accident!? I know your luck is quite good, but you should know how unlucky Aqua is!
Ah! Those guys went inside!
… We came all this way but couldn’t make it in time…
W-W-What should we do!? If I’d known it’d end up like this, I should’ve just let Kazuma loose that arrow and take our chances!
Y-You have a plan for this, right, Kazuma? You always come up with some underhanded trick in such situations…
K-Kazuma…
Haha…
H-Hey, what’s wrong? Don’t give up hope yet. They just entered the Demon King’s castle, it doesn’t mean that Aqua is already dead. It’s too early for tears.
… No, if I properly learnt Advanced Magic… If I was a proper Crimson Demon instead of this joke of a mage… we would’ve caught up to Aqua a long time ago… When I think about that, I…
… W-Why? Do you know of some kind of spell that can break through that barrier?
One might be able to break through the barrier with the Light of Saber spell that Crimson Demons like to use. If the magic power of the user is high enough, that spell would be able to cut through anything… If I had memorized that spell… If I had bothered to learn any other spell… Breaking through a barrier like this is the job of the spellcaster. But I’ve always been stubborn and never once did anything that is expected of one.
If Yunyun were here instead, she’d be able to cut through the barrier with Light of Saber. Failing that, she could communicate magically with Aqua. If another Crimson Demon was here, she could’ve fired off some spell that wouldn’t attract the attention of the monsters in the castle and caught Aqua’s attention…
If you’re going to say that, if I didn’t stubbornly refuse to learn any weapon skills, we would’ve had a much easier time going on adventures. It’d be the same for our past undertakings, but this journey too would’ve been much smoother and we’d have caught up with Aqua faster. You’re not the only one to have been willful, Megumin. I too…
If only I picked up some weapon skills
… Hey, Megumin, that barrier surrounding the castle. Do you think you can break it with Explosion?
… That’s impossible. Explosion is a spell that converts magic power into pure explosive force. I might be able to create a few cracks in the barrier, but I don’t have enough firepower to bring it down…
In other words, you can’t take it down with a single blow. But what if you could hit it multiple times? Can you break through it then?
T-That’s impossible. That kind of barrier will repair itself over time. Even if I start regaining my mana the moment I cast Explosion, it would’ve fully repaired itself by the time I can cast it again. In the first place, the moment I unleash my spell, the forces of the Demon King would’ve come rushing over…
So you can break it if you hit it repeatedly in a short time, right?
Y-Yes. But a barrier on that scale wouldn’t go down with just a couple of hits. Even Aqua could only make a small hole in the barrier. It would take at least several dozen hits… 
Several dozen shots, huh? So if you could cast Explosion that many times, that annoying barrier can be broken, right?
Yes. To take down a barrier of that scale, I would say… thirty… no, around twenty shots would do.
Hey, wait, what are you planning, Kazuma? Are you planning on using our trump card, Explosion? Sure, Aqua and the others might peek out in shock if we hit the barrier with Explosion, but that will definitely draw the attention of the Demon King’s forces too. And, to use our trump card in such a way…
Darkness, give me my bag.
Come to think of it, I gave that armour to Darkness, but I haven’t given anything to you yet, right, Megumin?
Eh? T-That’s fine. I’m not some kind of high maintenance woman who’d keep it on my chest if I don’t receive an expensive gift every now and then.
Ah!
Hey, Megumin, that makes it sound like I am that kind of high maintenance woman…!
I never said that you who treats that gift like some great treasure and polishes it with a grin whenever we get any amount of free time is a troublesome woman. If anything, I think it’s kind of cute.
Come now, don’t say that. I already got an expensive present for you, so just accept it.
… I-Is that so? Y-You didn’t need to go out of your way…
You’re grinning from ear to ear, you know? Sounds like you are a pretty high maintenance woman… Ah! My hair! Do you really like pulling on other’s hair that much!?
It’s a little late, but this is my present to you.
Y-Y-Y-Y-You…! Do you understand the value of these things!? How did you gather so many of them of such pure quality…!
Of course I know their value. They’re worth over half of my entire fortune. You remember that time when Vanir chanced into a large amount of money, right? Back when I sold him all of my intellectual property rights in order to raise the funds to clear your debt. Wiz ended up using the money Vanir earned from that to buy a large number of top grade Manatite. As thanks for him helping me power level in the dungeon, I bought all of these off him before we left town.
K-K-K-K-Kazuma…! T-T-T-This is… this…!
Just as you’ve heard, these are all top grade Manatite. Those can be used in place of mana when casting spells, but normal quality ones can’t provide the massive costs required for Explosion. That’s what you said back when you won that piece of Manatite off Yunyun, right?
And I believe you said back then that to such a great mage like you, such a low quality item is useless. Well, here is a pile of top grade manatite perfectly suited for a top grade mage such as yourself. It’s all for you.
Are you insane!? Just one of these stones can buy a small house. With this many Manatite of such high clarity here, you can buy a small castle, you know?
I don’t mind, go ahead and use all of it. Smash that barrier without hesitation.
Are you sure? Really? Manatite are one use only, you know? Once I make use of them, they’ll vanish.
I don’t mind, have at it. It’s my treat, so go ahead and use every single one.
Are you really sure? Plus, if I repeatedly hit the barrier with Explosion, the Demon King’s forces will definitely come rushing towards us.
When they do, go ahead and blow them away with Explosion.
That guy who is even stronger than the Demon King himself that Serena mentioned might come out too. That person who is said to be the strongest mage in the world…
No matter who your opponent is, after you’ve spent all this time training and honing it, your skill at Explosion Magic will definitely be superior. I don’t care if the Demon King himself or one of his subordinates or even Aqua were to come running out of that castle, blow every single one of them away! I’ve accumulated a lot of stress on the way here as well! Now is the time for you to show all those who treat you as a joke just what you can do! We can just earn the money back later! Between the Demon King and Aqua running away from home, I’m close to my breaking point! So, in my place, help me vent all this stress!
W-W-Wait, Kazuma, didn’t you just bring up a name that shouldn’t be blown away just now!? Your speech sounds really cool, but isn’t it just asking someone else to settle your grudges…!?
S-Shut up! Wealth is also part of my abilities! You go around brandishing your authority as a noble lady too!
Wha-!? What do you mean by that! I don’t abuse my power as a noble… W-Well… Mostly… not…
Once we take that idiot back, we’re going to start working hard! Right now, I’m an elite adventurer who mastered a lot of skills, Kazuma! We’ll definitely have a much easier time of it compared to back when I was sleeping in the stables!
Leave it to me. I’ll make good use of the present you gave me… I’ll never forget this day for as long as I live. I shall turn that impudent fool who dares name himself the strongest mage in the world without my permission into dust!
I’ll be counting on you, the strongest mage in the world.
Aaah… Aaaaah… Do you really know just how much just one of these manatite is worth?
Oh shut up you penniless noble! Just keep watching our backs, otherwise that curse on that armour of yours will make you run out the moment enemies start pouring out of the castle!
Penniless noble!? J-Just who are you calling a penniless noble!? I already told you, my family isn’t poor, they are just frugal and dislike levying unfair taxes! More importantly, you are really stupid with money sometimes! Just like back when you bought me and this current situation! Not even a war between nations would use this many top grade manatite!
Oh shut up, I know my spending habits are a little strange. But, even back when I spent all that money to clear your debts and even now I never once regretted my choice to shell out my fortune!
…I-Is that so. A-ah, I see…
… This is my once in a lifetime debut, so why are the two of you fooling around?
With the Manatite I received from you, I am now capable of performing a feat not even the greatest mage in the world can match. What you are about to witness right now is my life’s greatest work… Be sure to carve it into your memories.
My name is Megumin! The foremost Archwizard in Axel, and one who walks the path of Explosions! I don’t care if you are the strongest mage in the world, a dragon, a devil, or the Demon King himself, I shall reduce you all to dust!
Explosion!!!
Pardon me, may I have a moment of your time?
You’re one of Aqua-san’s companions, yes? I really want to buy Aqua’s delicious water, but is she not selling today?
I’m sorry, I’m not following you at all.
No, usually, Aqua-san would bring out her sparkling and delicious water around this time, but…
Well, due to certain events, she’s not in town at the moment.
When I use Aqua’s water for my cooking, my children don’t get any allergic reactions…
Come one, come all! I, Pierre, one of the great street performers competing for the number one spot in the capital, shall amaze you all!
The town of Axel is famous for making street performers run off in tears! Will my acts be fit for your discerning gaze!?
Now, first off, a greeting! What could be in this bag, I wonder…!
A rookie killer! A rookie killer bigger than the bag will jump out!
No, a flock of crows will fly out! They’ll fly out and draw a picture in the sky! Aqua-nee-chan did it!
… No, this is just some candy I’m giving out as a greeting. I haven’t started my act yet. This is just a candy box. Here, little lady, a sweet for you.
It would seem that the residents of this town are no strangers to street performances! Very well, I shall skip straight to the eighteenth act! Behold, the disappearing act!
Disappearing act? Don’t tell me…
He’s joking right? There’s no way he’s being serious, right?
Oh, seems like that sparked some interest! Behold! When I cover her with this cloak, she’ll disappear in an instant! Of course, this is just an ordinary cloak! No tricks or magic here!
Stop it, what are you trying to do to that lady!?
This guy is crazy! Go call a policeman or an adventurer or someone!
I-I don’t know why everyone’s so agitated, but… Well, why don’t you see it in action before judging!? Now, is everyone prepared!? One, two, three!
N-No! O-Onee-san is–!
She disappeared! This guy is really crazy! He’s definitely dangerous!
Get someone here, this guy is a criminal! He’s a murderer!
Please wait, this is just a show! Why is this happening!? What is wrong with these people!? Everyone’s reactions have been completely odd!
… Great street performer Pierre, could you please accompany us to the station?
Why!? What is wrong with this town!? I just performed an act in the streets! For what reason must I be arrested!?
That’s obviously because you caused that woman to vanish! You just said there aren’t any tricks or magic!
There really is something wrong with this town! Of course there’s a trick to it! That’s a woman that just knows how to use teleport-!
What, so it was a trick after all. Well, once you’ve seen the real thing…
What, it’s just teleport? What a boring trick…
Come to think of it, I don’t see Aqua-san anywhere. She usually shows up long before now to break the performer’s heart.
Ah, Kazuma, it’s good that you showed up! It seems like Aqua racked up a pretty huge tab at the bar! They just sent us the receipt…
AAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAH! I’ve had it with that idiot! When she gets back, I’m going to scold her ears off!
W-What’s wrong, Kazuma!? Don’t raise your voice so suddenly, you gave me a fright…
Plenty of things are wrong right now, but first, take a look at this!
… Isn’t that the mug that you were raising a fit over some time ago after you thought you lost it?
W-Well, such things is just par for the course with her. I’ll introduce you to a dinnerware shop that is primarily frequented by nobles, so you can buy a replacement there.
That’s not it. Even I wouldn’t blow my top over one broken cup. If she had properly admitted it, the most I’ll do is make her my manservant for a week.
I think that’s precisely why she hid that cup from you.
… That’s the rare relic you picked up in the Crimson Demon village, right? … B-But, well, Aqua didn’t break it on purpose…
That’s the strange jacket that you treasured, and this is an empty bottle? Aah, she drank the expensive wine you bought. And then there’s… Sorry, there’s just too much stuff for me to keep track of.
… What? What’s so funny? This jersey is really important to me, you know? The fact that it ended up here after I put it in the laundry must mean she didn’t pay attention while scrubbing and tore through it… Yeah, I knew it!
Ah, no, I mean… No matter what you say, you’re still thinking about what happens after Aqua comes back, so…
… Well, I suppose I can take care of the trash for her. In exchange, she’ll be our manservant for a month.
What are you raising a fuss in Aqua’s room for? Did you find some kind of lead?
No, I didn’t find any leads, but I did find one more reason to drag her back to this town.
… I see. Then, we have to get her back as soon as possible so we can properly lecture her.
Indeed. I’m looking forward to seeing what she will do by way of apology..
… Say, have the two of you looked into the box? She can’t possibly have only broken my stuff, right?
Pardon me… Ah, isn’t this the Rookie Killer figurine that I painstakingly saved up to buy!? I thought Chomusuke dragged it off somewhere! So it was here all along!?
Aaah, this is the tea set I got from Lumes! And I told her so many times to be careful when handling it…
We have to get her back as soon as possible so we can properly lecture her.
Indeed. I’m looking forward to seeing what she will do by way of apology.
… Well, if she cried and apologized, I guess I’ll forgive her…
Explosion! Explosion!!!
Wahahahaha! Wahahaha! That’s it, Megumin! Give it to ‘em! You are the strongest mage in this world!
Look, Darkness! Behold this wondrous sight! Thinking about it, the Demon King’s army has caused me quite a bit of trouble in the past! Now I’ve finally gotten some revenge! Wahahaha! Look at that pathetic sight! And you dare call yourself the Demon King!?
Ah, aaah… Aaah… Top grade manatite that are each worth more than a house are disappearing right in front of me… One… Two…
Explosion! Explosion!!!
Are those elite soldiers of the Demon King’s army!? They look like they’re about to piss themselves! I’m sure they’re normally pretty strong enemies, but to us right now they might as well be kobolds!
Aaaaah…Awawawawa…
Explosion! Explosion!!!
Explosion! Explosion! Explosion!!!
T-This is Hell… This is Hell on Earth…! Even if it used up a lot of top grade manatite, if any of the nobles or His Majesty were to witness this, they would definitely designate Megumin as the most dangerous person in the world…! There’s no way the Kingdom could ignore her…!
Wahahahaha! This feels great! It’s like all the gloomy stuff clawing at my chest vanished in an instant! Megumin, get them! Keep blasting even after you shatter the barrier! Aqua and the others have only just entered the castle! The Demon King’s room is most definitely on the top floor! Once you break through, raise your aim a little and take the entire top off!
D-Don’t do that! Considering Aqua’s poor luck, she might end up getting caught in the blast! And look at Megumin! Her eyes are already shining brighter than ever…!
Explosion! Explosion!!!
A bigshot showed up. I wonder if he is the ‘world’s strongest mage’ or whatever Serena was talking about.
Explosion!
Wha─!?
Ooh!
…I am…! The Demon King’s… Strongest…! …A sudden attack…!
If you can hear me, then respond! Just who are you!? Adventurers? How dare you bombard the castle from such a long range!? Do you not know of the legends of the Demon King and the Hero, or of the conduct of nobility!? The divine blood that flows in my veins cannot abide such an unseemly act…!
Did you figure out what this guy is saying?
I’ve used my Lip Reading skill, and he seems to be saying that attacking the castle from range is unfair. Like, super unfair.
That sounds really childish coming from someone said to be the strongest mage in the world… Though, it’s true that I’ve never heard of someone taking on the Demon King in such a manner…
So, can I blow him up?
Go ahead. We have the range advantage, and there’s no reason for us to play along with him.
…I feel sorry for him…
You have been warned! Behold my power! The infinite mana granted to me from the demonic realm and my vast knowledge of magic shall render you─
Explosion!
He’s gone back behind the barrier. Oh well, I was going to destroy it either way. We’ll settle which one of us is the strongest after I bring it down!
Explosion! Explosion!!!
Aaaaah, what should we do!? What should we do!?
It’s hopeless, this is the end!
What is wrong with her!? Is she out of her mind!?
The barrier won’t hold! If we don’t get away quickly, that vicious Crimson Demon will destroy us all along with the castle!
Why did such a last boss-like creature suddenly attack us!? How can she keep casting Explosion like this!? Is this some kind of attack by a Demon King from another world!?
M-Mama──!
…Even with… True power… Taken out by that… That… Small… Crimson Demon…
He said if he was in peak condition, he would’ve taken out that flat Crimson Demon easily.
Explosion! Explosion!!!
K-Kazuma, did he really say that!?
Pretty much.
All we have to do is wait for the insane Crimson Demon to run out of mana! The enemy outranges us, so we will focus on maintaining the barrier! I can draw a limitless amount of mana from the demonic realm, so if we draw this out into a battle of attrition, we’ll be able to take out that insane mage without direct combat!
He says he’s ‘waiting for the crazy Crimson Demon mage to run out of mana’. He has an unlimited supply of mana, so he can’t be bothered to deal with crazy mages. ‘Just repair the barrier and turn it into a battle of attrition’, or so he says.
I’m going to kill him.
Wait, Kazuma, did he really say that!? Did he really put it like that!?
Pretty much.
Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion!!!
Wait…!
Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion! Explosion!!!
I… Am… The… Strongest… Oldest… Of the Demon King’s Army… My name is…
Explosion!!!
Thanks for your hard work! Still, this is a horrible sight. I don’t think it was this bad even back when the mobile fortress Destroyer attacked us. Anyway, with this, you really are undoubtedly the world’s strongest… H-Hey, Megumin, your nose is bleeding.
Eh? Ah… 
Oh, come on…
Hey, Megumin, why is your cheek so hot? What is going on? This isn’t just from excitement, is it!?
N-No, it’s fine. I’m fine. Just watch, I’ll take out the top floors of the Demon King’s castle now…
Explosion Magic is the strongest offensive magic that humanity is capable of. It’d be stranger still if you are perfectly fine after casting it so many times in quick succession. Casting using manatite involves circulating the mana stored within the crystal through your body. It shouldn’t put too much strain on your body if a healthy person were to cast regular spells with it, but…
But it seems to be too much for Megumin’s body…
Don’t make it sound like it’s a problem because my body is too small! It’s fine, I can still carry on. Actually, please take me with you!
I’m not letting you cast any more Explosion Magic today. And I’m carrying the bag, so don’t push yourself.
…No matter what you say, if you are in danger I’ll still blast away. And this is something you gave me, so I’ll have to insist on carrying it myself.
…Alright, here is where the real work starts. Is everyone ready?
Ah, let me take the lead here. Even if a Dragon shows up, I won’t give an inch. Seeing Megumin get all the spotlight is making me a little jealous.
Heheheh, I’m afraid the only way to overshadow me today would be to take down the Demon King.
Kuh…! The role of a female knight is to be captured by the Demon King, but we came here to take him down… Do I fulfil my role as a female knight or defeat the Demon King…
Why do you think we came here? Have you forgotten about Aqua?
Ah!
Uwoh!?
Megumin! Waaah! Megumin! Megumin! I-I-I was so scared! This place is really scary!!
W-What’s wrong, Yunyun? You do love to cry, but you look really bad today!
Satou Kazuma, you caught up with us! …Actually, I’m surprised you were safe. Wasn’t the Demon King right outside!?
No, why would the Demon King be outside?
W-We managed to sneak into the castle thanks to Aqua-san… While we were exploring the castle with the help of the light-refracting spell, the castle was suddenly hit by a mysterious barrage… Aqua-san said that the Demon King must have sensed that his natural enemy, a goddess, has entered his castle and plans to collapse the entire structure to bury us alive, so we rushed to the entrance…
Demon King
Demon King
Hey, what happened to Aqua, then?
T-That’s…!
Aqua-sama, um… We got separated… The sudden explosions threw the castle into chaos. In the confusion, we managed to use Yunyun’s spells and my companion’s Lurk skill to make it here, but… She must be close by. She was with us until just a short moment ago. When I took my eyes off her for just an instant…
I’m sorry… I couldn’t protect Aqua-sama after saying all that to you… Dammit, what Magic Sword Hero am I? I couldn’t even protect the person I love─!
No, wait, sorry to interrupt you while you’re getting emotional, but getting lost is like her signature trait. It happens all the time, so don’t worry about it. More importantly, we should go look for that idiot.
I don’t really want to split up, but it’s an emergency, so we’ll have to in order to look for Aqua. Shout if you run into an enemy. Mitsurugi or Yunyun will come running over. I don’t mean to brag, but we probably won’t be of much use in combat.
O-Okay, if you are willing to say it so boldly, then I won’t rely on you in combat. Give us a shout if you run into any problems.
Darkness, let’s go this way. Knowing Aqua, she’s probably found some dark and out-of-the-way place to hide in out of fear of running into any enemies.
No, she came in with Yunyun and the others, right? Considering how cowardly she is, she would definitely head towards the widest passageways so she can be more easily noticed…
Do not push.
Hmph, you might be able to fool those simpletons back there, but you won’t fool me that easily…
Do not push.
Shit, it was a trap!
Waaaaah!
Aqua?
…Eh? …Kazuma?
K-Kazuma…! Waaaaah! Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san!
Waaaaah! Bwaaaaah! Aaaaah!
Okay, okay, I’m sorry. I can’t help it, it’s an automatically triggered skill! Come on, I’m sorry, so stop crying already!
Hey, keep quiet! We are in the Demon King’s castle! If you keep raising a fuss some of his underlings might come to investigate!
But, but…! When I thought we finally met up again, Kazuma, Kazumaaaaa!
Oh, come on, show me where you hit your face, I’ll fix it up for you… Heal!
It-It healed… Kazuma, Kazuma, you used Heal…! Ah, aaah, aaaaah…! Waaaaah! You shitty NEET, you came all this way to steal my role!? You’re not content with just demoting me to the goddess of toilets, now you’ve stolen the only thing I’m good at, too! Alright, bring it on, you thieving NEET! My real enemy isn’t the Demon King, but you! Let’s settle this right now!
Stop being a pain in the ass! Do you have any idea how much trouble we’ve gone through while you were off getting lost like a fool!? You even left a letter practically begging us to come after you before running away from home! You really are a handful, you know that!?
Seems like I have no choice but to give you a taste of divine punishment…! I’ll make you regret angering the Goddess of Water! The water will refuse to come out of the shower just as you are washing your hair!
Your punishments are always so petty! Anyway… No, wait!
I really did hear a woman’s voice.
That’s impossible. We are on the top floor, you know? The intruders are still wandering around somewhere on the first.
Stalker
What’s wrong? Why are you making funny faces all of a sudden? You’re not challenging me to a ‘who can make the funniest face’ contest, are you? I might be talented, but that would tarnish my image as a beautiful goddess, so…
Who the hell would challenge you to such a stupid game!? I’m not making strange faces, I’m focusing! Underlings of the Demon King are coming this way, hurry up and hide!
Come to think of it, how did you end up here? Did you press the button too?
Yes, I fell for that sophisticated trap that exploits your desire to push something labeled ‘do not push’! I’m sure the Magic Sword Guy and the others will be here before too long.
Yeah, that is a fearsome trap that exploits reverse psychology. The others will definitely be here soon, so all we need to do is to buy time… Is there any place to hide…? Oh.
I found a pot!
…Hey, I found this first. Go find somewhere else to hide.
You should be the one to go elsewhere… Ah!
Oh my, seems like only I, the beautiful goddess who can breathe water, can hide in…!
What are you talking about?
Ah!
Did you hear that!? There’s definitely someone here!
Over there! It’s coming from that room!
What should we do!? What should we do!?
Crap, I can’t believe I made such a mistake. It’s been a while since I interacted with you, so…!
I have no idea if you are stupid or smart! What should we do!? We’ll be discovered!──
──Who’s there!? Come on out!
…There’s no one here.
That’s strange. I could’ve sworn I heard something.
No, there’s definitely something in that room. Something annoyingly bright to the point of being blinding!
A mere undead, and a mere wraith at that, dares to call me annoying!? You sure are full of yourself! I’ll purify you until there’s nothing left!
Dammit, I knew nothing good would happen whenever you are with me!
I knew it, intruders! Hurry up and get reinforcements… Wait. Don’t these guys seem… Kinda weak?
Yeah, doesn’t seem like we’ll have much trouble dealing with them. Are we doing this?
Seriously!? Please don’t make me deal with that woman! She’s really dangerous! She smells just like my worst kind of natural enemy!
Aqua, give me some support! Leave the vanguard to me. I’ve awakened to my true power in the short time we’ve been apart! Just stay back and bear witness to my mastery of a thousand skills!
Kyaa~!Kazuma-san, you’re so cool! Hey, Kazuma, do you need the buff that makes you a great actor!?
Please! That skill is really useful!
T-These guys sure are noisy! Do they not have any sense of urgency!
Let’s do this! Let’s tear these two jokers to shreds!
I can feel my body growing fainter just by being near this woman!
Hey, Kazuma, even though we are in a crisis as usual, even though this isn’t an enviable position at all, for some reason, I feel like I’m having a lot of fun!
Dammit, me too! I’m conflicted about feeling this way, but this is just business as usual!
Aqua, I’ll leave that wraith to you.
I’ll take care of it! Ahahahaha! An undead who dares appear before me must really be tired of this world! What should I do with this wraith? How should I play around with him!?
Hey, I don’t know why, but this girl is really scary! She’s really dangerous! Sorry, but can I run away!?
Payne, let’s switch targets! You and I will take care of this beansprout-looking man! Noss, you take care of that woman that Payne is so afraid of!
Right, leave it to me! Payne, if you have to, go ahead and hide behind us!
What are you talking about? He’s a vanguard class with nothing but a sword! Dealing with such people is my specialty! Hey, little man, just so you know, physical attacks won’t work on me!
Kazuma, now’s your chance! Use ‘that’! Your instant kill ‘that’!
That!? What do you mean by ‘that’!? I know I said I’ve awakened and whatnot, but do I really have some secret power that will show itself when I’m in a crisis?
!?
What, no, Kazuma, you’re just an ordinary human that wouldn’t seem out of place anywhere in the world. I’m talking about that! You know, that thing you always do during such situations!?
Oh, that’s what you’re talking about! Eat this, Flash!
Guraaah!
Kyaaa!
Dammit, this brat…!
Cheap tricks like these…!
Hah! I don’t rely on my eyes to see, so that won’t work on me!
What about it!? Your friends won’t be able to help you now! And by the time their eyesight returns, you’ll be gone from this world! Aqua, now’s your chance, do it!
K-Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san! W-Where are you!?
You are the one who told me to blind them in the first place, so why did you get blinded too!?
I didn’t know you learnt such a spell! What I was talking about was your underhanded combo with something earth and whatever breath!
Too bad, little brat. Since physical attacks don’t work on me, you have no chance of victory! Haha!
L-Like I’ll let you!
Hyaaaaaa!
Kazuma, what was that!? I felt really cold all of a sudden!
That heartless brat! How could you use your friend as a shield!? Aaah, my arm is disappearing!
P-Payne, what is going on!? I know the woman is a bad match for you, but you should have no problems taking care of the guy, right?
I-I can’t do that! Noss, Logia, hurry up and regain your sight already!
Noss, in front! That man is right in front of you! Get him!
Right!
Graaaaaagh!
Did I get him!?
You didn’t get him at all, Noss! You just cut Logia down! Aaah, how did it come to this… You bastard, stop fooling around! How did you imitate my voice so perfectly when we only just met!
Ahhh, I cut down Logia!? W-What is going on!? Tell me what is going on, Payne!
That man imitated my voice somehow! Noss, don’t do anything until your sight returns! If you cut me with that magic sword of yours, even I will be annihilated!
I-I see, okay! I’ll stay right here!
Yeah, just stay right there! Seriously, you are a real pain in the ass, you musclehead! I thought you were a fool for a while now, but I can’t believe you would drag us down like this at a time like this…!
P-P-P-Payne!? I-I-Is that what you really think of me!?
N-N-No! That was said by that man…! Damn you, what are you grinning about! I’ll kill you!
Eat this!
Ouch! T-That is a magic sword!? Dammit, you look like a rookie at first glance, but you have some pretty good equipment on you! But now that I’m this close, the battle is mine! Eat this, the ultimate technique of the undead, Drain Touch!
Woaaah!?
Dammit, get away from me! Heal! Heal!
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Y-You can use recovery magic too!? But too bad, it seems like my Drain Touch is sucking away more life force than your unpolished sword skills and your magic can take away!
What are you… Hyaaaaa!? Y-You, you are clearly a human, so why can you use Drain Touch!? S-S-S-Stop! I’m going to disappear!
Graaaah! M-My body is… Why are you smiling like that!?
I’m thinking that there’s no meaning in draining mana from a ghost! I felt far more fulfilled when I drained mana from a beautiful female mage!
You drained mana from a beautiful female mage…!? S-So jealous…! I understand how you feel. If we met under different circumstances I would’ve loved to talk about drain feel… But right now we are enemies. It’s about time we settle this, human!
Here I go, my serious Drain─!
God Blow!
Undead are but child’s play for my might. How was I? Wasn’t I cool?
You really need to learn how to read the mood one of these days…
Y-You bastards, how dare you…!
Hey, Aqua, this guy is acting like a protagonist seeking revenge for his fallen friends despite being the guy who cut them down in the first place.
As expected of a knight of the Demon King’s army, he truly is vile to the core.
Y-You were the one who set me up to cut down my friends! You still have the nerve to say that!?
D-Dodged!
…Hm? Well, you certainly are no slouch when it comes to dodging. I didn’t expect my blade to be dodged so cleanly…
Lightning!
!?
K-Kazuma-san really knows a lot of skills! You defeated your opponent in a head-on fight like the protagonist of some legend! This feels really strange!
S-Shut up. There are times when I feel like fighting properly, you know!?
Sorry to interrupt you while you are celebrating, but I was just startled. That spell only gave me a little jolt, that’s all.
…Don’t mind! Don’t worry about it, Kazuma! Though, I’m a little relieved.
Oh shut up! You two have been making fun of me for some time now! I was hoping to conserve my mana, but in this situation I have no choice but to use my trump card!
!?
Is it a beam!? Are you finally going to shoot a beam!?
I don’t know what you are trying to do, but the moment you unleash your spell, I’ll pierce your stomach. I’ll even tell you what technique I’ll use. It’ll be a thrust. I’m going to run you through with a thrust. If you dodge this attack like before, the woman behind you will get hit instead.
…You heard that, Aqua!? You better dodge with all your might!
You’re talking like you’re already planning to dodge it! Hey, don’t you have any desire at all to protect this frail and beautiful goddess!?
…Just who are you people? Where did you come from? It was only a short while ago that I heard about the barrier being destroyed. Only the most skilled of intruders would be able to make it all the way to the upper floors… Though, I think the guys in charge of traps set this place as the destination for one of their teleport traps that they created as a joke…
Y-You… I didn’t think it was possible, but did you two fall for that joke of a trap?
T-T-That’s not it! I saw through that trap! I knew that this is the quickest way to the Demon King’s chambers, so I activated it on purpose!
Y-Yeah, me too. I knew that there was no way that could be an actual trap! My unclouded eyes identified it as a shortcut from the very start!
…Eeeh
You definitely fell for…
Don’t you dare finish that sentence! Eat this!
Teleport!
!? Heheh, Teleport, huh!? Pity, but teleporting me is─!
Teleport too…! How did this happen? This man really did have a trump card up his sleeve! …By the way, where did you send him?
Axel’s police station.
Wouldn’t the police officers cry if you sent someone like that over to them?
When you are in trouble, you should rely on the power of the state. They deal with the thugs in town and rowdy adventurers every day, so they should be able to deal with a single monster… Well, now that I’ve awakened, such opponents are but mere trifles to me.
I’m relieved to see you’re still relying on others!  It’s really best that Kazuma-san has a bit of a small-fry aura about him!
Ahahaha, you little brat! If you keep saying such things, I’m going to teleport home by myself.
Oh, Kazuma-san, you’re such a joker! Ahahaha… It was a joke, right? You’re joking, right!?
Why didn’t his armour get teleported with him?
…That guy who got transported probably had low magic resistance. You remember how that Dullahan had sacred magic resistance on his armour, right? If he fails to resist the spell, he might end up instantly losing depending on where he was sent. So he must have placed an enchantment on the armour to protect against teleportation. Which would be fine if it just prevented teleportation magic, but if he got ahead of himself and placed the enchantment on the armour itself…
So the armour didn’t get transported, but the guy inside was? Isn’t it just defective, then?
I wouldn’t know. It just sounds like what a musclehead knight would do.
I thought there was a problem with my instant kill technique, but if that’s the case, then it’s fine. Anyway, let’s just wait for the other guys to catch up.
Yeah. With a trap like that, I’m sure everyone will be with us before long.
They aren’t coming!
What’s going on? Did no one else fall for that high-IQ trap? No, no, there’s no way…
…Maybe they didn’t even notice that high-IQ trap? Megumin only ever thinks about breaking things, and Darkness only cares about finding hard objects to bang against. They aren’t the most perceptive of people.
Wait, hold on, doesn’t that means they’ve gotten lost and now we have to go out and find them?
Seems like it. Seriously, I take my eyes off them for just a moment and they get themselves lost. Those girls really can’t get by without me. Honestly!
…Say, Aqua, which do you think is better? Exploring the Demon King’s castle filled with traps and danger lurking around every corner by ourselves, or just teleporting back home?
The ‘teleport home’ option has my support.
…I would really like to do that too, but Darkness and Megumin who are so in love with me would never give up on me and go home, so I’m a little conflicted.
Yeah… I don’t think the two of them who worship me will retreat without seeing me first.
Hmm? I think I heard some footsteps. Hold on a bit.
Reinforcements! Call for reinforcements!
Get the guys from the upper floors to come down too! The intruders are going crazy out there! The guys who destroyed the barrier are coming up!
Nooo! I was told that being a guard at the Demon King’s castle was a safe and stable job! I think I forgot to feed my Neroid today, so can I go home!?
Sounds like the others are on a rampage. They seem to be making their way up fast.
As expected of the legendary attendants I’ve chosen… The brave heroes that carve a path through the Demon King’s castle in order to rescue the goddess. Doesn’t it sound like it came straight out of a storybook?
To be more specific, rescuing a goddess who ran away from home, got lost, fell into a trap, and ended up trapped in the Demon King’s castle for no reason.
You should apologize to Megumin and Darkness when you see them. When we get home, Darkness will definitely give you an earful. And I know Megumin usually ends up in trouble along with you, but I don’t think she’ll defend you this time.
…Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, I’ll give you a special, funny-shaped stone when we get home, so could you cover for me? I do feel a little remorseful this time.
a little
Hmm? Why are you looking at me like that? Are you perhaps moved by seeing the beautiful form of a goddess after so long? If you’ve developed any bit of respect for me, you should make all my favourite dishes for dinner from now on…Ow-Ow-Ow! It hurts! Sorry for getting full of myself! Ah, but a part of me kinda missed this scene!
Alright, listen up! The large detachment led by the Demon King’s daughter to fight humans to the death has overwhelmed the knights at the capital! If she comes back to find that we, the custodians of the castle, were unable to stop a few intruders, it’ll be all on our heads! Search every room on every floor! Find the intruders and cut them to pieces!
──Hey, Kazuma, are you really going to do this? I’ve been through quite a lot so far, but I feel like what you are about to do is far worse.
What’s the point in saying that? If they find us here, it’s all over. I’m scared too, and you’re the one who wandered out to the Demon King’s castle in the first place. And isn’t this the best chance for us to defeat the Demon King?
Sure, but, I don’t really care about the Demon King right now. I was really relieved when I saw you, and I kinda just want to meet up with the other two and go home.
I don’t particularly want to face the Demon King either, but everyone is already giving it their all. What do you think would happen if the two of us went ‘yeah, the Demon King is too scary, so let’s just go home’ after all that they’ve been through?
I wouldn’t be surprised if we got stoned.
Right? So let’s get out of this room and meet up with the others. After that, I have a plan that will work as long as we can get into the Demon King’s room. I’ll show you my true special move.
What kind of special move!? Is it a beam? Are you going to shoot a beam for real this time!? Or could it be that you learnt my Party Tricks─!
Of course not. Enough of that, get ready. Cast that actor’s buff on me again. And I will…Kukuku… Seems like it’s finally time to make use of this…
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, I don’t think that is something that a hero trying to defeat the Demon King should use. My goddess instincts are telling me to purify that potion at once.
D-Don’t do that. Honestly, I’m not sure about it myself… The assassin who taught me my special move also gave me this potion. I don’t mind getting my hands dirty for the sake of the world. For the sake of my friends and everyone, I’ll give it my all so that I won’t have any regrets.
You’re saying some cool-sounding lines, but you are straying further and further away from the path of the hero. I really think you should choose your friends better.
I’m already hanging out with the patron goddess of the Axis Cult, so it’s a little too late to be saying that now… Hey, stop! It’s an expensive potion, so don’t purify it!
…Good. Are you ready? Then, let’s go.
I’m ready to go at any time… Kazuma, don’t go too far, okay? If your attitude is too annoying, I won’t be able to put up with it. I don’t mean to brag, but I don’t have a lot of patience.
I found an intruder!
…It’s no good. Logia is as dead as a doornail. The man who left this woman behind must be very skilled. Look at Logia’s wound. It’s like he received a single fatal blow while he was completely defenseless.
Dammit, revenge for Logia! Let’s turn this woman into minced meat!
W-What, you want to go!? I’m strong, you know!? The Axis Cult didn’t put their faith in me for nothing!
Axis Cultist!? This girl is an Axis Cultist!
Crap, I just talked to an Axis Cultist!
Don’t get any closer, I don’t want to catch it!
Hey, I’m not doing it! I don’t want to get involved with the Axis Cult!
Oh, wow, look at that blue hair. She’s definitely an Axis Cultist!
Uwah! Hey, Noss, you keep a firm grip on her, you hear!?
That was close. I was this close to touching an Axis Cultist.
Hey, Noss, just dump that thing outside the castle… Seriously, you might be skilled, but you really need to work on your smarts… She’s an Axis Cultist, you know? Noss, aren’t you afraid of her? Do you even know what the Axis Cult is?
captured
No, no, sir, we can’t do that! This girl is our trump card against that guy who ran away! That Kazuma guy is a formidable opponent that’s skilled in both sword and magic. But as long as we have this girl as a hostage, our victory is assured! Let’s use her to draw out the intruders who are rampaging through the castle!
H-Hey, Noss, did you hit your head during the battle? You weren’t all that smart to begin with, but now you speak like some low-born thug. Didn’t you use to conduct yourself like a proper knight? You said it’d make you seem more cultured…
And taking a woman as a hostage, too. You sure have picked up some bad habits…
I’m a little taken aback…
…Hmm, considering that someone as strong as you is calling him a skilled foe, it’d be best to have a trump card or two when confronting him. Okay, Noss! Take that woman and follow us! Make sure you keep an eye on her! Don’t let her come near us, you hear!?
Ah! Mammon-sama was touched by an Axis Cultist!
Geh! Mammon-sama, keep your distance!
Noss! I told you to keep an eye on her! Cut it out, Axis Cultist! Go over there! Shoo! Shoo!
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san.
What? I told you not to talk to me, right?
I can’t take this situation for much longer. Why are they treating me like some kind of disease? This is no way to treat a goddess. I was expecting something more like fitting the image of a goddess captured by the forces of evil. This feels more like a rabies-infected beast getting cordoned away.
Put up with it for a little while more. With this many people here, even running away is a little… Oh, seems like we’re here.
Hey, you guys, we caught one of the intruders! From the reports, it seems like the rest are scarily strong. Strong enough to rattle the entire castle to its foundations, and there is the fear that in a straight-up fight, we might not be able to protect the Demon King! However, Noss came up with a great plan to deal with them… Namely, using this girl as a hostage to wipe out all the intruders in one fell swoop!
Ooooh!
We’re saved…
Still, using a girl as a hostage… I thought Noss was a decent guy, but to think that he could come up with such an idea…
It’s a little disgraceful to be taking hostages. Such tactics should be the domain of the middle management. We are the Elite Guard of the Demon King, you know? Should we really do something like this?
This is the captain of the Demon King’s Elite Guard! We’ve captured one of the intruders! All units currently in combat with the intruders are to inform them of this fact! The one we captured is a priest of the Axis Cult! Tell them to surrender if they want to keep her alive!
Hey, woman, how many intruders are there? Tell me everything you know if you don’t want to get hurt… In particular, tell me about that super-skilled Kazuma guy who ran away without you. What class is he? What about his equipment? His fighting style? Personality? Past accomplishments? Tell me everything you know.
I don’t mind telling you, but I’m getting a little thirsty, so bring me a cup of tea.
This woman!
Go and brew some tea for her. It’s going to be her last cup anyways, so use some of the top-grade leaves.
…So, let’s start with the number of intruders, and the class of that Kazuma guy. So, what class is he? A Crusader? Or perhaps a Swordmaster? Judging from the wounds left on Logia’s body, I doubt he’s a magic-using class.
Including me, there are about eight of us. And Kazuma’s class is Adventurer.
Bwahahahaha!
Adventurer!? The weakest class, Adventurer, you say!? At least try and keep your lies realistic! How would such a person make their way into the castle in the first place!? Bahahaha! …Ah, I see, so he’s your porter, huh? And then he placed all his skill points into sword wielding, is that right?
You don’t get it. Kazuma-san can use the sword, but he’s also good with magic. He even learnt Recovery magic behind my back. He can also use Teleport and various others skills like the undead-exclusive Drain Touch… Ah, thanks.
Hey, this is just plain water.
Hey, stop messing with her with such petty tricks. Do you intend to drag my name through the mud!? I understand your anger after losing Logia and Payne, but stop doing stupid things!
Pardon my subordinate for his actions. Anyway, you said Drain Touch? That’s supposed to be a rare skill that only undead can use… Well, nevermind, let’s move on. Tell me about his equipment. Does he have some legendary-tier weapons that the black-haired, black-eyed people usually possess? In that case, I can understand how he took out both Logia and Payne. But we know how to counter those types. We just need to hit him with Steal…
Kazuma-san’s equipment is just common gear you can buy in any town. He’s clashed with your Generals several times using just a cheap short sword he bought. Right now, he’s using an imitation Japanese sword with the strange name that he commissioned. He likes to swing it around in the middle of the night going ‘Judgement! Judgement!’ …Oh, thanks.
…I think I’ve heard about him before. That man named Satou Kazuma… If I’m not wrong, he’s the guy who has been taking out our Generals one by one… 
This is just hot water.
Is-Is that man the same Satou Kazuma who has been defeating our Generals?
He’s the same person. He’s involved in the defeat of most of your Generals. Beldia, Vanir, Hans, Silvia, Wolbach, and Serena. As far as I know, those are the Generals that Kazuma has defeated.
Apart from that… He took out the monster pretending to be Elroad’s prime minister, and is also the one who defeated the mobile fortress Destroyer, and many other high bounty targets as well.
What was your next question? You wanted to know his fighting style and his personality, right? He is, in a word, devious. He’s devious and underhanded, and has an extremely sharp mind. In combat, he will never fight you head-on. Instead, he would do something like using Farsight and Night Vision skills to observe you from afar before taking you out with Snipe, or hide from sight using Lurk in order to launch a sneak attack from behind.
Snipe and Lurk…
Yes, Lurk. And he has the Enemy Detection skill, so even if you hide, he’ll probably still know exactly where you are… In fact… He might be in this very room!
Eeek!
It’s hot water again.
Wait! That’s really strange! I really did brew tea… No, wait, Mammon-sama, you have the wrong idea! I definitely did pour her a cup of tea!
Mammon-sama, we’ve caught the intruders! One of them was a terrifyingly skilled warrior with a powerful magic sword, but he fell in line when we told him we had the blue-haired woman hostage!
Great, bring them in! Well done! And, Noss! Your plan worked out! I’ll be sure to reward you later!
Aqua-sama, you are unharmed!?
Oh, pardon me, but I’m going to have to ask you to put those weapons aside. I didn’t want to resort to such tasteless tactics, but after hearing this woman say such scary things about you, I have no choice. Hey, you over there! You are that Kazuma guy, right? Throw away your weapon and come here!
That’s not him.
That man is the Magic Sword Guy. Kazuma-san isn’t with them.
!?
Tsk, yes, the numbers don’t line up… Right, okay, just this woman is enough to serve as a hostage. Take care of the others. Don’t you dare resist now! Who knows what would happen to her if you resist…!
Dammit…!
Drop your weapons! You guys, surround them!
There’s no need to rush into this, Sir Mammon! Payne and Logia won’t rest easy if we give them such an easy death! Please, let me take care of this!
E-Er, I see. Well, you did know the two of them best. Then I’ll leave them to you… But seriously, do you intend to continue speaking like that?
I’m trying to change my image, Sir… Alright, take a good look at this, you fellows. At the end of this rope is your companion, trembling in fear!
She’s drinking tea.
Hey, Crusader girl!
!?
First off, throw away your weapon. If you don’t, you know what would happen to this girl casually drinking tea over here…
…Understood. I wouldn’t be able to hit anyone anyways… There. Would this be fine?
Next… Well, I’ve taken quite a liking to that wicked-looking armour of yours. Let’s get you out of it.
What!? T-This armour is…! N-No! This armour, this armour is…!
You won’t take your armour off!? Don’t you know what situation you’re in? What happens to a female knight who is captured after entering the Demon King’s castle… I’m sure you understand what is going to happen, don’t you? Now, take off your armour in full view of all these people!
Y-You..! You…!
Woooow…
I can’t believe it. Noss, I’m really disappointed in you.
I never expected you to be this vile… So you were putting on an act all this time…
H-Hey, Noss, I did say I’ll leave it to you, but this is a little…!
Heheh… I’m sure you have a very ripe body hidden beneath that armour…! Now then, this is for the great cause of saving your friend’s lives, so hurry up and strip!
G-Great cause…! N-No, I’m not the kind of person who can be brought to heel by a man I don’t even know…! Aaah… What is with your enthralling gaze and irresistible aura…!? Just who are you, to be such a perfect match for my desires…!?
Oooh!
I-I… I won’t let this embarrassment get the better of me!
Stop! I can’t let you get away with this! You might be a part of the Demon King’s army, but you’re all still knights, aren’t you!? Aren’t you ashamed of treating a young maiden like this!? Don’t you have the guts to face me head on!?
Hey, Noss, there’s no need to go any further! We already have her as a hostage, so such acts are unnecessary. Now, everyone, surround them! I’ll deal with the magic sword guy myself. If Kazuma isn’t here, this will be a cakewalk!
Kazuma? Are you talking about Satou Kazuma? Compared to him, I’m far stronger! My name is Mitsurugi Kyouya. I’m the reasonably famous Swordmaster with the magic sword!
Oh? Are you that afraid of our Kazuma?
What? Who’d be afraid of some sneaking coward!?
Don’t underestimate that man. After all, almost every enemy that has gotten involved with him has met an unseemly end… Of course, you are no exception.
Shut up! Shut up! My name is Mammon! I’m the captain of the Demon King’s Elite Guard that protects this hall leading into the Demon King’s room! In a straight up fight, not even the Generals would be a match for me! There’s no reason to be afraid of a man who hasn’t the guts to even show his face!
Really? You were so jumpy just a short while ago. Are you really not afraid of Kazuma-san? He might even be right next to you, you know?
I told you, I’m not afraid of him! Hey, Satou Kazuma, can you hear me!? You damned coward who only knows to sneak around! You must be on this level, right!? If you can hear me, come out right now and name yourself!
Yes, Kazuma the Coward here. Nice to meet you.
H-He’s here!
He killed Mammon-sama!
How despicable can this man be!? He’s lower than a beast!
Eh!? W-What!? How could this happen! Are you still human!?
Light of Saber!
That man is dangerous! Surround him and get him together!
Oh, going three on one with me? You guys really bring shame to the title of a Knight. I can’t believe these are the much vaunted Demon King’s Elite Guards!
Y-You’re not one to talk! I don’t want to hear that from someone who stripped their female friend at swordpoint and killed Mammon-sama by surprise!
I-I can’t believe the nerve of this guy…!
That’s enough. There’s no need for us to go along with this man’s pace─
Bind!
!? Eh? Wait!
Ow-ow-ow! Hey, Kazuma, it hurts!
Guah, dammit! Not only does he sneak attack Mammon-sama, but he also has no qualms about catching his companions in his attacks! What a scumbag! I let my guard down! The rest is up to you guys!
Kazuma-san! Kazuman-san! This guy’s armour is so hard that it hurts! Can I use my magic to dispel this bind!?
Hang in there for just a short while! I’ll take care of these two right away!
He might be a scumbag, but he still neutralized one of us in the blink of an eye. Don’t let your guard down. We go on the count of three.
Leave it to me. One, two, three, right?
No, I think we should go with just one signal. Or maybe it’d be best to count to ten…
Eh? Eh? Which one is it?
Cut it out! Stop imitating my voice, you bastard!
The Crusader is heading your way!
Woah!?
W-W-What is this!?
S-Stop her! Don’t let her get over to them!
This girl is unstoppable! No matter how we cut her, it doesn’t phase her at all!
Kazuma, Aqua, I’m here to help! …Kuh, h-hey, Kazuma, give me a hand! These two just won’t let go…!
What kind of help are you trying to give by dragging two knights over here!? Now it’s two against four!
Heheh, then, what about turning this into a three versus four?
S-Say, Kazuma, I feel like the situation suddenly turned against us. Is it my imagination!?
Why do I have to face down five knights with a useless Crusader and Priest!? Are you guys idiots!?
Decoy!
I-I can’t believe I was affected by a Decoy skill…
Dammit, this Crusader is stirring up my abusive instincts… I feel itchy all over if I don’t stab her with my sword…!
Kuh, as expected of the elite of the Demon King’s army, you have a good thrust…! But I alone shall withstand all your attacks! Now, unleash all your wild savagery upon me! Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up and stab me!
Aqua-sama, are you alright!?
!? What… M-My demonic blade is…!?
This magic sword is a legendary weapon bestowed upon me by the Goddess herself! There’s nothing it cannot cut!
This man is far more dangerous than that scumbag over there! We need to take care of him─ Ah!
Rune of Saber!
This man once again did something unnecessary…
Aqua-sama, are you hurt?
I’m fine. More importantly, I need to heal Darkness’s wounds…
Ah, m-my apologies!
…I don’t really mind, but if you are going to commit sexual harassment so casually, you’re going to end up just like our Kazuma.
You are really strong. Couldn’t you defeat the Demon King by yourself with that strength?
You got an even greater cheat than I recieved.
Now, then, we’ve achieved our original purpose of bringing Aqua back. We could just use Yunyun and my spell to teleport back home, but…
What are you saying after having come this far? The Demon King, the enemy of all humanity is right before us. With the majority of the Demon King’s army away attacking the capital, there’s no way we will get another chance like this. We can put an end to the war between the Demon King and humanity right now.
Ouch!Ow-ow-ow-ow! It really hurts! Hey, why are the two of you pulling at my cheeks? This is an emotional reunion, so shouldn’t you be hugging me and saying stuff like ‘I was so worried about you’!?Ow-ow-ow, it really hurts!
Well, listen up. The barrier that surrounded this castle was blasted apart by Megumin. Thanks to her, we can attack this castle at any time. Let’s leave the rest to the Belzerg’s knights, the cheat-holders, and the Crimson Demons.
You destroyed the barrier? Megumin, you took down the barrier that the combined efforts of the entire Crimson Demon Village couldn’t take down?
That’s right. You felt the castle shake under the force of a barrage of explosions, right? That was actually fired by Megumin with the help of a ton of manatite─
K-Kazuma, don’t say anything more…
S-So that wasn’t an attack by the Demon King, but you… Megumin, you let loose with your magic despite knowing that we were in the castle…!
You’re horrible! Are you really my friend!? I can’t believe you tried to bury us along with the Demon King!
T-That’s not it! It’s just, I got a gift back then, and various other things happened, so I got a little too excited…!
Hey, Darkness, I don’t mind you rubbing my head. I really don’t mind, but it kinda hurts when you do that while wearing gauntlets! I apologize for running away from home, so please forgive me!
So, what are we going to do? Are we going ahead? Well, I’ll follow you wherever you go, Kyouya.
I came here for Kyouya’s sake, too. We’ll die together, Kyouya. I’ll follow you to the ends of the earth…
Aqua-sama, what do you think we should do?
Me? …Well, if we could easily take out the Demon King, I would do it, but after meeting up with everyone… Umm… I kinda don’t feel very motivated…
Right, let’s go home then. We can come back next time with better preparations and a better plan. For starters, now that the barrier is down, I can set a teleport point in front of the castle and bring Megumin here every day to launch an Explosion on it─
Wait, Satou Kazuma, there’s no reason for the Demon King to remain in this castle now that the barrier is down. There’s a high chance that he will hide out in a dungeon somewhere and waylay knights and adventurers until he gathers enough Generals to establish the barrier. With that in mind, I really don’t think we should let this chance slip by.
Hey, Kazuma, I’m done with chastising Aqua, so now it’s your turn! I can’t believe you embarrassed me like that in front of so many people! What is with that ill-fitting armour! Hurry up and strip already!
Oh? It looked like you were enjoying it…Ow-ow-ow-ow! Stop it, I’m sorry! Don’t trap me in a joint lock while I’m wearing armour, my bones are creaking!
You were the one who dragged Aqua-sama to this world, right? Despite that, you’re giving up on taking down the Demon King? Isn’t it only proper for you to risk your life to take out the Demon King and deliver her back to Heaven? That should be your responsibility.
And I can’t entrust the person I love to you if you remain like that…
You have really bad taste.
Dammit, you’re still like this! And here I thought we would be able to become friends and reach an understanding if we defeat the Demon King together! H-Hey, what is this skill!? I feel like I’m losing strength…
I have plenty of male friends in Axel! I would only come off as a sidekick if I hang around someone like you! Go somewhere else!
Umm, I’ve been having fun every day since I came here, and I don’t mind being here at all you know?
─Then, why did you leave town?
I just wanted to feel what it was like to run away from home…
…You know, I kinda wanted to punish those who’ve forgotten how important I am by leaving town for a bit. So how did it go? What did the people in town say about me? Were they worried?
Of course they were worried about you. You still get lost in that town even after living there for more than a year, so there’s no way you can travel alone.
Before we left town, the adventurers told Kazuma to make sure to bring you back before teaching him all of their skills. If it weren’t for the attack that the Demon King’s army had planned for Axel, I’m sure most of them would have come with us.
Oh, is that what they call ‘tsundere’? They always act so cold, but now look at them… Well, I guess there’s no helping it! Let’s go home, Kazuma!
…Very well, if Aqua-sama says so, this time, we will…
…Do you know what ‘opportunity makes a thief’ means?
After trading almost my entire fortune for manatite, I’m almost broke.
I wonder just how much the Demon King’s head is worth?
You are really underhanded, you know? Between our duel and that sneak attack you pulled off earlier, I’m starting to think that you just hate a head-on fight. You’ve been boasting about how you beat me to the four corners of the world, so it’ll reflect badly on me if you keep using such underhanded methods…
This isn’t underhanded, I’m just being prudent. Plus, there are fights that are worth taking even if I end up getting branded as a devious lowlife. After all, this battle would decide the fate of humanity…!
…Kazuma is saying all that, but he’s been pretty underhanded in all the battles we’ve fought so far, hasn’t he?
Shh!You shouldn’t say that, Aqua! He’s acting cool just before the battle with the Demon King!
Yeah, don’t press him on that. What will we do if he throws a tantrum and teleports home without us?
Everyone, please listen to me.
…It’s been hard fighting making it this far. What awaits us is a battle that will decide the fate of humanity…
Kazuma-san, Kazuma-san, are we really doing this? After everything, we have gotten a little stronger, so we can just earn money the usual way. Defeating the Demon King to get rich in one shot doesn’t seem like you, as cowardly and cautious as you are.
…Who exactly was the one who said all that stuff about defeating the Demon King in the first place? I’m giving you a good telling off once we get home.
At the end of the day, you do want to go back to Heaven, right? Then, let us defeat the Demon King, gain the right to go back to Heaven whenever you want, then live your life happily after that. Putting on a brave front here or forcing yourself to go on is a death flag, so just do things normally. Especially you, you often do stuff that triggers death flags, so be careful.
Kazuma, I think I had enough, so let’s go home. I miss Emperor Zell too, so let’s go home. I can enjoy a glass of delicious wine while letting your lectures wash over me, so… Let’s go home?
…I want to go home.
Oh shut up! Even if you are fine with it, I’m not! If I don’t make it such that I can return you to Heaven at any time, it’s really going to weigh on me if anything happens!
What do you mean by return, you tsundere NEET!? Can’t you be honest for once in your life!?
Fio, Clemea, there’s no need to be tense. Even if we lose here, we can always get stronger and come back for another go. I know the two of you are getting worried about plateauing and sneaking out to various places to train… Thank you for sticking by me all this time.  Let’s defeat the Demon King and go home together!
Hey, Aqua, you know the plan, right? The moment someone dies, we’ll retrieve the body and teleport out immediately. Don’t go out there and revive them on instinct, you hear? If you get downed while reviving someone, we’ll all be done for. Don’t revive them until we teleport to a safe place. You got that?
You don’t need to tell me that over and over again. Just trust me… But, Kazuma, I have a really bad feeling about this. And not just the usual bad feeling about you dying like a lemming, but something that can’t be reversed…
You idiot, don’t say any more! Why do you like hoisting death flags so much!? Just listen to me for once in your life. No matter who dies, don’t go out in front. Just support us from somewhere safe. As long as you are alive, we’ll be able to pull through as long as we have the bodies. Do you understand?
Looks like you’re done with your conversation… Now, It’s my turn. First off, I’m giving you back some of the stones, Kazuma. Just in case.
Wow, what a huge manatite…! Are you really giving it to me? Megumin? H-Hey, Megumin? If you are giving it to me then let go already!
This is a really precious item that I got from Kazuma, so make sure to take good care of it. Only use it at the most critical of moments, you hear? This is something he gave to me, after all!
Okay, I get it. I get that you’re happy that you got a gift! You don’t need to boast about it this much! I’ll take good care of it!
Hey, Megumin, what about me?
You don’t need it, do you? I’ve been together with you for a long time now, and I’ve never once seen you run out of mana… Ah, what are you doing!? This is very important to me! Besides, even if I gave you one, you’ll just hold on to it to sell later!
Hey, Kazuma, do you remember the time I joined this party? You said ‘Darkness, we might look this way now, but we’re serious about taking down the Demon King.’ I never expected that to become a reality…
Don’t say that. Reminiscing at a time like this is a death flag, you know? If you have to say something, talk about something happier to give me the motivation to see this through. Say, for instance, that I’ll be able to create a harem after defeating the Demon King in order to ensure that the blood of the Hero is spread as far as possible.
E-Even at a time like this, you are… No, this is more like you… Wait, after you defeat the Demon King? Defeat the Demon King…!
Aaaaah!? Hey, Kazuma, do you still have that ring on you!? You know, the one that you stole from Iris-sama when you snuck into the castle way back then!?
Stop, Mitsurugi is here, you know!? Why are you bringing it up now!?
N-No, I can’t ignore that. You snuck into the castle and stole something from Iris-sama…?
Nevermind that! Most importantly, the ring! You didn’t lose it, did you!?
I didn’t lose it! It’s kept safely back in the mansion, right next to my precious porn magazines!
Por─! Don’t put the royal ring together with your porn books! Look, let someone else deal the finishing blow to the Demon King! …No, it’d be troublesome if Mitsurugi deals the finishing blow too… Argh, just let me have the head of the Demon King!
What are you rambling about all of a sudden!? Do you really want achievements so badly!? You always act like you have no interest in money, but you’re finally letting your greed show, you piss-poor noble!
I’m not doing this for such a stupid reason! As long as it isn’t you or Mitsurugi, I don’t care who deals the final blow!
Then, let me take the title of the Demon King Slayer.
Megumin, don’t make things more complicated than they already are! You can’t use Explosion magic in that room in the first place! And it’d be a problem for you too if Kazuma defeats the Demon King! Aqua, you say something to him, too!
I’m more concerned about your armour than that, Darkness. I don’t know why you’re wearing such an evil-looking armour, but to my eyes, that armour is definitely cursed. I can remove the curse for you, but it is possible that the armour will vanish when I do that…
If you guys can kill the Demon King without me having to assassinate him, that’d be fine by me. More importantly, do you understand what you’re getting into? As far as I know, your magic resistance and physical defence is the highest in Axel. If you can’t withstand his attacks, then nobody will be able to defeat him.
I’m fairly hapless in anything else, but you can rely on me when it comes to defence.
I’ve always wanted to be a knight, but I never thought that I would be able realize my dream of getting ravaged by the Demon King… Kazuma, thank you.
Give me back the feelings of gratitude I just had for you.
Demon King! Prepare yo─
Cursed Lightning!
Cursed Lightning!
Cursed Lightning!!!
Wai─
Damned cowards who attack without even showing your faces! Is this what a Demon King does!? Name yourselves!
Pardon my subordinates for their rudeness! Indeed, you do have a point. Intruders who have rampaged through my castle, I know not if you are heroes or mere fools, but this battle shall render that clear… Now, show me your power─
Inferno!!!
Guaaah!?
Hey, Yunyun, I thought I told you to save that manatite for the most critical of moments! How could you make use of it right at the start of the battle!?
…Crimson Demons, huh. As bold as usual…
S-Sorry! But a friend of mine asked me to ‘Go hunt down that damned annoying Demon King and give him a good few blows in our place’, so…!
My name is Yunyun! I’m an Archwizard and wielder of Advanced Magic. As the foremost mage of the Crimson Demons and the future chief, I will show you the true power of the Crimson Demons!
Thinking about it, the Crimson Demons have caused me no end of trouble… Very well, show me what the future chief of the Crimson Demons is capable of!
What’s with that cool act!? Normally you’re too shy to even name yourself! And you used the Manatite I gave you just for this entrance!?
Ow-ow-ow, what are you doing at a time like this!? Megumin, cut it out!
Decoy!
Let’s go, Demon King!
Darkness, you’re pushing yourself too much! You need to reduce the power of your Decoy skill!
What is with this girl!? Is she a lump of iron or something!?
What are you trying to do?
Kazuma-san.
Power!
…What are you doing, Eris-sama?
Protection!
Umm, Eris-sama, why are you casting spells on me?
Resist! …So you can return to battle the moment Senpai revives you.
Give me a break, Eris-sama. I already failed. I didn’t even consider the possibility of there being undead in the room… And here I thought it was a really good plan, too.
What are you saying? The battle has only just begun. Even as we speak, everyone is fighting with the Demon King… True, we are at a disadvantage, but… Ah! Darkness’s Decoy skill just ran out! Mitsu…? …Rugi-san is surrounded by enemies! …Oh, good, Yunyun just blew them away with Tornado.
We had a plan, the moment someone dies we’re calling it off. We’ll retrieve the body and teleport out immediately. Aren’t they getting ready to retreat?
No, they haven’t given up yet. If anything, Yunyun-san is getting fired up by Megumin-san’s encouragements. She’s saying ‘My lifelong friend and rival, help me avenge Kazuma!’ and waving her staff around in anger. Even now she looks ready to unleash Explosion in such a cramped room. And Darkness is off saying disturbing things like ‘I’ll kill you’ repeatedly…
Now, it might seem a little harsh, but I’ll have to send you back out there. This is the first time I’ve broken a rule because of my own selfishness rather than at Senpai’s insistence, so I’m a little nervous, but…
No, no, that’s impossible, Eris-sama. From what you told me earlier, Mitsurugi is having a tough time, right? What do you expect me to do by throwing me into a battle like that? I have the weakest class and have absolutely no cheats at all, you know? Actually, I have to ask, does Backstab and poison even work on the Demon King? I mean, in most games, instant death attacks and status effects like poison don’t work on final bosses.
…I doubt poison will work on the Demon King. Most likely, instant death attacks wouldn’t work either…
Then there’s nothing I can do. My stats are also far lower than everyone else out there. The only thing I have going for me is my high luck… I don’t mean to complain too much, but don’t you think I’ve already done more than enough after being dealt such a crappy hand? Not that I mean to boast, but…
I was sent to another world with only the clothes on my back, and immediately, I had to sleep in a stable and perform hard manual labour when I lived my entire life in a modern house as a shut-in. And along with having to bail out my troublesome companions, I somehow ended up racking a huge debt that forced me to pick fights with strong opponents just to clear them. And even after that, trouble would come knocking at my door one after the other…
I don’t think it’s asking too much to get some kind of reward for all the troubles I’ve gone through. Come to think of it, I think my personality has twisted for the worse ever since I came to this world. I was never an upstanding specimen of humanity to begin with, but… I feel like I’ve gotten even worse since I came here…
But, it was fun, wasn’t it?
…Well, I can’t deny that.
Right?
It’d be really sad for Kazuma-san to be the only one who retired while everyone else has yet to give up, wouldn’t it? So I’ll make it such that you can jump right back into battle the moment Senpai brings you back.
That wouldn’t happen. I’ve already told that idiot countless times not to move forward no matter what happens or who dies out there.
All the magic you’ve cast on me would go to waste.
…Is that so? Then, I’ll continue. Haste!
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san!
Kazuma-san, we are really in a pinch, in more than one way. Megumin has started chanting Explosion Magic!
…Why does she never listen to what others say?
But that part of Senpai is a little cute, isn’t it?
Kazuma-san, you’re smiling, you know?
Seriously, just who does that idiot think I am? Still, I’m surprised she managed to revive me in the middle of a pitched battle.
I’m sure it’s because Darkness is still holding out against the Demon King and all his guards by herself.Fufu, even the Demon King and his personal guards are taken aback by Darkness’s toughness. I really wish I could show you his dumbfounded expression.
The Demon King, huh…
…Just so we’re clear, I don’t have any plans right now. I won’t roll over and wait to die, but even if I go back there, I don’t think I’ll make much of a difference.
Then, I’ll give you one piece of advice. Right now, Senpai is on the other side. It may be difficult for you to believe, but Senpai is still a powerful goddess. She’s strong enough to be able to seal away the Demon King’s abilities for a short period.
Eh, really!? It’s like she’s a true goddess!…But, wait, she never said a word about that.
…S-She must have forgotten about it…
…Oh, but, wait, the Demon King’s most fearsome ability is to raise the stats of nearby monsters. Will that ability be suppressed too?
That won’t happen. Her seal would only reduce the Demon King’s physical abilities, like his strength, physical defence and magic resistance. But there lies the true hint. Kazuma, you can use Teleport, right?
Once his magic resistance has been reduced to the point where even my spells can work on him, I can teleport him to Axel’s police station! Then I can have every adventurer in town surround him and beat him to a pulp!
N-No, you can’t do that! Right now, a small detachment of the Demon King’s army is attacking Axel! They are holding out pretty well for now, but if the Demon King shows up over there, the entire detachment will be strengthened and the town would fall in the blink of an eye!
Then, what should I do…?
You registered the deepest part of the dungeon as one of your teleport points, didn’t you?
I see, I can send him to the deepest part of the dungeon and leave him to die! It’s a little dark, Eris-sama, but it’s definitely a good plan.
No, no, that’s not it! That place might be crawling with monsters, but the Demon King would be able to easily bend them to his will, and he’d stroll back out within a day… So I need you to do me a favour, Kazuma-san…
Can you defeat the Demon King for me in a one-on-one duel?
No, no, no, no, that’s definitely impossible. If we really want this to work, it’d be better to send Yunyun, Aqua, and Mitsurugi to the dungeon along with the Demon King. Yunyun and Mitsurugi can take him down while being supported by Aqua’s buffs, and then Yunyun can teleport them all back. It’d have a far better chance of success than having me fight him one on one.
In the first place, the Demon King can use Teleport too. If he were sent there under such circumstances, he would simply teleport back to the castle.
If that’s the case, wouldn’t he do the same even if I teleport him to the dungeon by myself?
Fighting with brave adventurers and dying magnificently is also part of the job of being a Demon King. If he were to run away from a lone adventurer, he wouldn’t be able to call himself a Demon King anymore.
B-But… Then, how about sending Mitsurugi and the Demon King alone instead? He seems like he genuinely wants to become a hero.
That would be unlikely to work. Mitsurugi can only use a sword, so I doubt he would be able to best the King of the demons inside a dark dungeon… But if it was you, with your mastery of various skills and ability to adapt to any situation, there might be a chance. Plus…
Plus, for a single, powerless young man with the Weakest Class to defeat the Demon King…  Wouldn’t that be far cooler!?
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san!
…Seriously, she usually only sees me as a joke, so why does she always come running to me for help whenever things start getting serious?
That’s definitely because Senpai trusts you… You really are a tsundere, Assistant-kun. Despite complaining so much, you are soft when it comes to Senpai.
You really are cute, Big Boss. After I defeat the Demon King, will you marry me?
That’s fine. Please break the news to Megumin-san and Darkness, Assistant-kun.
Seriously? Then I’ll do my best! I’ll go tell Megumin and Darkness that I’m marrying Chris!
S-Sorry, please don’t do that! The two of them will definitely get angry with me! It’s just a little joke, so please forgive me!
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san!
Currently, the capital and the town of Axel is under attack by the Demon King’s army.
In Axel, the adventurers that you’ve laughed, fought, and drunk together with are battling against a small detachment of the Demon King’s army, while at the capital, the Royal Knights led by the King himself, the adventurers from Japan, and the elite forces of the Crimson Demons are engaged in fierce combat against the bulk of the Demon King’s army──
And the brave young maiden who looks up to you as her brother, the chosen of the divine relic Aigis, is currently about to engage the Demon King’s daughter in a decisive battle with the support of a certain Axis cultist and Megumin’s Crimson Demon friends.
Eh!?
It’s a law of this world that, when a Demon King is crowned, the monsters of the world will slowly become stronger. Conversely, when the Demon King is vanquished, the monsters will gradually grow weaker… Kazuma-san, you understand what I’m trying to say, right?
Telling me that just made me more motivated. Even my sister is giving her all, so I’ll give everyone a hand by taking down the Demon King.
Before you go back into the world, Assistant-kun, let me give you one final parting gift.
When it comes to this spell, I’m confident I won’t lose out to anyone! In the name of the Goddess of Fortune, I grant you the greatest of all blessings! Blessing!
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san! Hurry up and come over! Hurry up!
You really are helpleeeeeeesss!
Now, go forth…
And defeat the Demon King!
Megumin, I don’t care, go ahead and kill them all! I’ll protect all of you with my body! I’ve already proven that it takes more than a single Explosion to kill me!
Very well, let us greet death together! And even if Darkness couldn’t protect me, after firing off so many Explosions in one day and trading lives with the Demon King at the very end, I can die with no regrets! It’s an honour to die with you all!
Wait, stop, Megumin, wait! Don’t blow up Darkness-san!
Ah…! You’re finally back, Kazuma!
Your majesty, please get behind us!
Hey, Crimson Demon! If you cast Explosion here, you yourselves will be caught in the blast! Do you understand what you’re doing!?
Kazuma, please start preparing to cast Teleport. We’re all getting out of here. Once Kazuma and Yunyun are done with their preparations, Megumin, just fire your Explosion through that balcony over there and we’ll all make a break for it!
Aqua, listen closely to what I’m about to say. Actually, listen to me for once in your life. Eris-sama just told me this, but you can weaken the Demon King, right?
…Kazuma-san, what are you talking about? There’s no way I can do something so goddess-like. Are you okay? Get a hold of yourself.
You get a hold of yourself! Have you forgotten what you are!? You’re technically a goddess, aren’t you!?
Oh right! I am a goddess! I’ll use the divine power of the goddess to seal the Demon King… No, wait, I can put a seal on him to lower his stats, but that’s all it will do. The Demon King hasn’t really taken an active part in the battle, so I don’t think weakening him will do much.
Once you’ve weakened him, I’ll take care of it somehow… You killed that Grim Reaper-like undead monster, right? That means my Lurk skill would work.
Kazuma-san, you’re still planning on doing this? …Can’t we go home? Let’s just leave the Demon King to the guys in charge and live a leisurely life instead. If we don’t have enough money… It’s against my principles, but I can consider selling my art. Ah, but it’s only to get enough money to live on, okay? I’m not selling them forever. So…
Just watch. You’ve been with me for quite some time now, so you know that I always managed to get us out of such situations. Just trust in me one more time.
It’s because I know you for such a long time that I can’t trust you.
Enough! Already! Just prepare to weaken the Demon King!
Ow-ow-ow!It hurts! Okay, fine, I get it, I’ll do it!
You get it? Once you weaken him, I’ll once again use Lurk to get close to him. Once I’m in range, I’ll use Teleport to abduct him to the deepest depths of the deepest dungeon, where I’ll finish him off.
Wait, hold on, you are planning to fight the Demon King one-on-one? My unclouded gaze tells me that the only thing that awaits you down that path is death, you know?
I have plenty of tricks up my sleeves. If things go really bad, I’ll teleport back to Axel on my own. If the Demon King doesn’t show up here, you can go ahead and assume that I’ve defeated him. Even if I can’t defeat him, I’ll buy you as much time as I can. Use that time to take care of the guards in this room. Without the Demon King present, these guys would be heavily weakened, so you should be able to handle them, right?
…Kazuma, what happens if you drop dead in the dungeon? If someone as squishy as you were to die in a dungeon, you might get eaten by some hungry wandering monster, you know?
D-Don’t call me squishy… Anyway, if things get really dangerous, I’ll run away. Even if I used up all my mana, I can still use this manatite to Teleport out.
Fuhahahah! If I defeat the Demon King here, I will become the new Demon King…!
Megumin, calm down! Even if you defeat the Demon King, you won’t become the next Demon King! Your eyes look serious, but it’s just an act, right!? The adventurers in Axel told me that they will treat me to a meal when we come back, so I must come back alive…!
Right, I’m heading out. Hey, Aqua, make sure you explain to Megumin and the others what’s going on after I teleport out. In particular, be sure to tell them that I’ll teleport home if I’m in any danger, otherwise they’ll definitely go crazy again.
…Hey, Kazuma, why do you care so much about slaying the Demon King?
…I’m not doing this for your sake or anything!
Can’t you just honestly say ‘I’m doing this for you, my Goddess’ at a time like this!? …Tsundere NEET, if you really feel that your life is in danger, make sure you come running back to us, you hear? A beansprout like you would die instantly if you take a direct hit from the Demon King.
I know, trust me. Do you honestly think I’m the kind of guy who would fight him till the bitter end? NEETs give up easily, so don’t worry.
I know. You’re a coward who gives up easily. I know you’re inept and easily led astray.
…And I know that at the end of the day, no matter how dire the circumstances, you’ll be able to find a way to resolve it, so go ahead and play with the Demon King. Just don’t die.
Oh, my kin who live in this world…
The Goddess of Water, Aqua, commands you…!
Place a seal on these tainted beings──!
Decoy!!
Protect the Demon King! Don’t break your formation!
It’s a bluff, that Crimson Demon girl won’t use that spell in such close quarters. Ignore the Crusader in your midst and focus on the man with the magic sword instead! And take care of the other Crimson Demon girl, too!
Dammit, how annoying… To think that a goddess would descend to this world… Is the true identity of the light that fell to the town of beginners really this dumb-looking woman…?
To think it was the goddess of water of all people who descended…! Hey, aren’t you supposed to be governing some other world? Or did you come here to bail out your junior goddess and put on some airs while you’re at it?
…!? You!? When the hell did you get there!?
Teleport!
…Where am I? I thought you would’ve teleported to a place where your friends are waiting for sure… Hmm, judging from the musty smell and the strong concentration of mana, we must be in a dungeon.
Bingo. We are at the lowest level of what is said to be the deepest dungeon in this land. If you want to get out of here, you’ll have to trek all the way up… Or teleport back.
Right, I’ll be heading back to my castle. Did you really think the Demon King couldn’t use Teleport? There’s no need for me to remain in this musty place──
Of course I know you can use Teleport. But is the Demon King really going to run away from a one-on-one fight with a brave adventurer?
……I see. I don’t know where you got this information from, but it seems like you did do your research on Demon Kings. It is true, if I were to run away from such a challenge, I would not be able to call myself the king of the demons any longer… However, you are a weakling who got done in easily by one of my underlings. A person of your measly strength is no worthy match for me. Go train for a few more years before coming back. You should be at least as strong as that Swordmaster with the magic sword before considering facing me.
I am an Adventurer.
…Adventurer?
Indeed, Adventurer. I have the weakest class, Adventurer.
…You’re an Adventurer? Not an advanced class, or a vanguard, or even a spellcaster, but a plain Adventurer? That beginner of beginner classes…
Indeed. A weak Adventurer is challenging the Demon King to single combat… Oh? No matter how weakened you are by the goddess’s powers, I’m sure you’re not so weak that you need to run away from an Adventurer, are you, my dear Demon King?
…I won’t fall for your provocations. I didn’t accumulate all these wrinkles just for show. So what if you are an Adventurer? …Ah, I see what you are up to. You’re not much use in direct combat, so your role is to teleport me away and keep me here to buy time for your friends to take care of my subordinates while they are cut off from my powers.
And once you’ve bought enough time, you’ll teleport away. If I teleport to the castle after that, I’ll be surrounded by your friends… That’s your plan, isn’t it?
Now, now, there’s no need to get hasty. This is my adventurer’s card. It’s a little dim and there’s some distance between us, but you can see my level, stats, and class, right? Come on, look at my stats. They are pretty low even compared to mid-rank adventurers, aren’t they? You can come up with all the excuses you want, but at the end of the day, you’re just afraid of being defeated. Would you still run away from such a weak and tasty morsel in front of you? Is that what a Demon King would do?
……………Don’t provoke me, little boy. If I feel like it, a brat like you would be dead in an instant.
Oh, that sounds just like what a third rate mid-boss would say. I’m really disappointed in you. You call yourself a Demon King and put on airs, but you’re just a cowardly old man who would run away from a man with the weakest class!
…Save your breath. Knowing that you have the weakest class and are clearly a sacrificial pawn gives me even less reason to fight you. I now know for certain that you are only here to buy time. Farewell, big-mouthed little brat!
──You know, I was the one who took out most of your generals. Who were they again? Beldia, Vanir, Hans, Sylvia, Wolbach and Serena. That was the sequence I faced them in, I think. And there was also Mr. Strongest who was guarding this castle whose name I didn’t manage to get… As the Demon King, at least try and avenge your subordinates.
What a bad joke. Know that a fool like you couldn’t even stall for time! Cursed Lightning!
!?
!?… Ah, that was close… Seriously, what kind of Demon King resorts to sneak attacks? But well, when you’re as good as me, seeing through an old man’s tricks is but child’s play. Hahaha!
…? You used a skill to dodge that, didn’t you? Normally, no one can react fast enough to lightning magic to dodge it. Well, it would seem that you’re a troublesome one.
Wait── 
Now, what do you intend to do next? You’re out of tricks, aren’t you? I may be getting up in years, but killing one measly adventurer is still…
……?
…Gyaaaaaaaaaaah!
What is this!? A protective charm? A curse of some sort!? Uuugh, you’re full of petty tricks…!!
Hey, that’s very important to me, so don’t mess it up.
…What is this!? My hand is almost burnt to a crisp! Just what is in it…!? …Blue hair?
It’s a charm stuffed full of a goddess’s hair.
I can’t believe I touched such a dangerous object! …Oh, right, I don’t have time to mess around with you. I thought you were small fry and went easy on you, but enough of that! If I don’t make it back to my subordinates soon…
Steal!
!?
Ah, it was a dud…
…Was it something important?
…It’s my daughter’s handmade… No, it’s nothing…
You use a sneak attack when you think you can take your enemies out easily, and start running away when they turn out to be tougher than you expected. Is this really what a Demon King is made of?Ah-ah, and I even went out of my way to get my hands on a magic weapon to fight with the Demon King! I’m really disappointed in you!
…It’s certainly enchanted, and it seems really valuable, but I don’t think that weapon is meant to see actual combat.
No, no, this is a pretty impressive weapon. A good friend of mine found it on the corpse of a dead adventurer, so it’s a completely nameless magic sword with no achievements to its name. In other words, it’s more than enough to kill a cowardly Demon King── Wah!
Very well! If you want to die so badly, I’ll send you over to the other side right this instant!
Wait! After all this provoking you’re just running like a coward!? What was it you called me just now? You are the one who’s cowardly!
You really are crafty to use those useless spells to blind me! Didn’t you challenge me to a proper duel!? Hurry up and come out, brat!
Hgrk!?
T-There you are! Just how much do you intend to play around with me before you are satisfied!?
Don’t you think you’re pathetic after provoking me like that? That Magic swordsman came at me fair and square! And so did that Crusader! What are you compared to them!?
Trap Creation.
There you are!
Draw your sword, brat! I’ll put an end to this in an instant!
Explosion!
!?
…! What…! What is this!?
Heh, don’t think I am just a normal adventurer. As I said before, I’m the one who took out most of your generals. A single Explosion is easily within the grasp of my abilities.
You lie! That isn’t even close to the power of a true Explosion! I couldn’t detect any magic coming from you, so you must have used an explosive potion of some sort! You really are full of cheap tricks── Hey──!
I’m tired of playing around with you. I’m not getting any younger, after all. I was hoping to conserve my mana for when I returned, but… You will not be able to dodge this.
Eat this! Inferno!
Create Earth!
What! Ouch! Hot!
You annoying little brat! Are you trying to seal off this passage with dirt and run away!? In that case, then our little game of tag is over! I’m──!
Create Earth Golem!
Going… Back to… The castle…
…You are capable… Of something like this…?
Time for round two!
Dammit!
Coward! What kind of Demon King turns tail and flees!? Fight me head on! What were you calling me earlier!?
You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!
Wahahaha! The Demon King is so weak! All of your generals put up a far greater fight than you!
You fool! What are you expecting from an old man who’s already long past his prime!? In the first place, my true power lies in strengthening my men, not in fighting in the front lines! Not to mention I’m currently weakened!
Eat this! Snipe! Snipe! Snipe!
Ow! Ah! Gurk! Y-You…!
…Pant… Pant… I can’t run anymore…
Did you really take out my generals? …I’m sure you did… You might be using underhanded tricks, but even I have been pushed this far.
How did they fare? Did they give you a battle they wouldn’t be ashamed of, like what a general should do? Did they at least give you trouble?
…Beldia was purified while he was wandering around in confusion after I stole his head. Come to think of it, taking him out is the reason why I first landed into debt.
Vanir was blasted to pieces with Explosion, but he turned up the next day happily working at Wiz’s store as her assistant. I’ve lost count of the number of times I got ripped off by him.
Hans almost devoured me, and Sylvia also almost devoured me in a different way. Ah, but Wolbach seemed to have a pretty good head on her shoulders… And the last general we fought, Serena, turned me into a Regina worshipper and killed me. Well, I’ve been through a lot thanks to them.
……Seems like you’ve had your fair share of troubles too…
Create Earth!
Wait, you’re not──
Create Earth Golem!
…Phew. Oh no, that took up more magic than I expected… Still, you’ve done quite well, brat. Against a swordsman, use a sword. Against a spellcaster, use spells. And against an adventurer, use whatever specialty they have demonstrated to crush them… But still, you’re the first one that forced me to resort to such a strange fighting style.
Now it’s my turn. But you truly are a man with plenty of interesting ideas. I wonder what you’re going to do next?
Now then, little brat, it’s time for round three!
Dammit!
Fuhahaha! Run, run! Why don’t you try creating another golem? You might actually win this time, you know!?
You know very well that if I create a new golem, it would easily lose to yours! Your personality is really twisted! Just as expected of the boss of all those guys!
Wha…! W-Wait! Those guys gave me a ton of trouble too! Beldia wouldn’t stop rolling his head into the baths, Vanir would constantly prey on my soldiers to harvest their dark emotions, and Wiz would take money and precious items from the treasury without asking and start selling them as practice for opening a real shop…!
Hans should properly ask if he wants to eat something, and not sneak into the granary and rub his poisonous body all over the food store there! Sylvia, stop saying you want to ‘become one’ to anyone who catches your eye! And Serena constantly runs around the castle asking people for money in the name of donations! Wolbach is the only decent one of the bunch…! So don’t talk as if I’m the worst one of them all!
Tinder!
!?
Y-You bastard…
…Incidentally, that wasn’t Explosion. It’s just Tinder.
I know that! You even screamed ‘Tinder’ just now! In the first place, there’s no way a mere Adventurer could use top-tier spells like Explosion!
Lightning!
Cursed Lightning!
…Graaaaah! Not bad! Not bad, little brat!
… O-Oooooouch! My shoulder! There’s a hole in my shoulder!
Trying to play a game of tag again? Sorry, brat, but I tire of that game. Cursed Lightning!
Aaah!
!? …You found a way to survive even in that situation. Just how lucky are you?
What do you mean by lucky!? If I was really lucky, I wouldn’t be in this place in the first place! Aaah… That bastard Dust, I can’t believe he gave me such a rubbish sword!
Y-You shouldn’t say that about something another person gave you… In the first place, a regular magic sword wouldn’t be able to fend off a spell like that…
In any case, you’re now out of options. How many manatite do you have left, and how many more times can you cast Lightning? You can’t cast Advanced Magic, can you? If you could, you would have used far more damaging spells than the intermediate spell, Lightning, that you’ve been using… So, what do you intend to do with that butter knife of yours? It doesn’t even look like it’s enchanted.
It’s Chunchunmaru.
…What?
It’s called Chunchunmaru. It’s not some butterknife, it’s called Chunchunmaru. After I defeat you, I’m going to donate this sword to a museum as the sword that slew the Demon King──
Cursed Lightning!
Uwah!?
Bastard, just how long do you intend to keep this up!? This is the first time I’ve been vexed to this degree!
Heal!
…You can use healing spells too?
Heal! Heal!
You really are good at running away, aren’t you? That’s enough, just give up. You did pretty well for an adventurer. I’m saying this from the heart. Out of respect for your performance so far, I’m willing to let you go. You still have a piece of manatite, don’t you? I’ll give you time to finish chanting your Teleport.
Say, brat, I don’t think I ever caught your name. In this kind of decisive battle, as the Demon King, I should make an effort to get your name. Why don’t you name yourself?
Heal!
My name is Satou Kazuma… What is your name?
It’s Yasaka.
Yasaka? Demon King Yasaka? I was expecting you to have a much more terrifying name.
My name is Yasaka Kyouichi. Demon King Yasaka Kyouichi.
…Wait, wait, wait, what? Are you from Japan? Are you human?
No, I’m a simple Demon. I’ve never been to the place known as Japan, though I’ve heard rumours of that country. Come to think of it, you have the same name as a famous hero.
Hey, stop spouting things that make absolutely no sense! What, are you trying to confuse me so I will hesitate to finish you off? That’s really low, you know.
Who is going to finish off whom, I wonder? Heheh, you know, I always get plenty of interesting reactions from adventurers like you whenever I name myself… Do you want to know the origin of my name? And do you want to know why the Demon King’s army is attacking humanity? It should be the greatest unsolved mystery of the Demon King’s army.
I never said I wanted to know any of that. Why would you specifically offer to tell me about any of that?
Because those are the questions the people with strange names like yours would ask upon meeting me. There is a popular fairy tale amongst your kind about the hero that became a Demon King… So, do you want to hear the truth of the matter that no one else knows?
…Um, so, can you tell me about the origin of your name? You can tell me why the Demon King’s army is attacking humanity later…
If you want to know that, you’ll have to defeat me first!
Wahahaha! Did that get on your nerves? It did, didn’t it? Ah, it feels nice to finally get you back after suffering so much at your hands!
…Still, it’s been some time since I named myself like this. So far, I’ve only ever given my name to those who are about to die. But I shall allow you to take this knowledge of my name home with you. Call it a gift in recognition of the fact that you pushed me this far in a fight all by yourself.
Say, are you really going to go back to your castle? My companions would probably be waiting for you when you get back. After all the time we spent down here, your personal guards would probably all be dead by now.
Well, yes, against those guys, I suppose all my subordinates would’ve long since been defeated by now… I suppose I’ll take a little break after I kill you or you run away. Then I’ll make my way through this dungeon and recruit a few powerful monsters to my side. By the time I return after my rest, my daughter should be coming back to the castle with the main army.
Say, if I said I want to go back to the castle with you, would you give me a lift?
…I see no reason for me to aid you. Though, you are quite talented, you know? Have you considered coming to work for me? I’ll have to put a curse on you that prevents you from betraying me, but if you are fine with that, I can take you back to the castle.
So, are you done with your preparations for casting Teleport? I did say I’ll let you go, but I can’t promise I can hold myself back the moment I lay eyes on your detestable face.
──Please don’t turn the corner, don’t get angry, and hear me out. How about we call it a draw right here? You can send me back to the Demon King’s castle first.
After you give me a lift, I’ll go back to town with my companions. You can take as long a break as you want. Or, even if you want to go back to the castle without resting, I promise my friends won’t lay a finger on you.
…Heh… Hahahaha. A tie? What are you saying? It seems you have some kind of misunderstanding. You lost. It’s only by my whim that I allow you to walk away…!
………I see, a draw, huh? Very well, adventurer. I’ll send you back to the castle first. Would that be acceptable?
That won’t do. I told you, didn’t I? Don’t turn around the corner, and don’t get angry. There’s no way I can trust you now that you’ve seen this. What would I do if you sent me to some deep crater out in the middle of nowhere? I would be on the losing end then, wouldn’t I?
…I understand. So, what should we do? If you unleash Explosion Magic at this distance, neither of us would be safe. No, even if you fired it from outside the blast radius, it would definitely cause this entire dungeon to collapse. I’m sure you’re well aware of that, which is why you didn’t use it until now, right?
In the first place, how can you, who couldn’t even use Advanced Magic, cast a top tier and most complex spell like Explosion? Just what are you?
…I wonder. I’m not sure of that myself. I’m not even sure of my place in the world. Am I their… Guardian? Lover? Owner? Master? Friend? Companion? Roommate? …I wonder which of these terms best fit me?
There’s a girl I know that loves this spell. She would drag me along and randomly blow things up with it every day. After spending so much time going along with her daily routine, it seems that I’ve become so familiar with the incantations and movements of the spell that even an Adventurer like me could learn it.
If you fire it from this distance, someone as weak as you would be reduced to ashes and dust. But I’m still a Demon King. A single shot of Explosion fired from an adventurer might not be enough to kill me, you know?
After Aqua has weakened you, there’s probably no chance that you can survive it. And besides, this entire dungeon would come down anyway. Even if you manage to survive somehow, it wouldn’t do you any good if you were buried alive.
…Aren’t you afraid of dying?
I’m super scared of dying. I’ve already died several times, so that makes me even more afraid.
…If I die here, many things that are unknown to humanity would vanish forever with me… Don’t you want to know the origin of my name? And why the Demon King’s army is──
I don’t care.
…Cursed──
Explosion!
──Welcome to the afterlife. I am the goddess who will guide you on your new path, Aqua. Satou Kazuma-san, you’ve lost your life at the bottom of the dungeon. Unfortunately, your life is now over.
Hey, Aqua, what happened after I teleported the Demon King away?
…There are a few choices available to you.
…Do you want to be reborn as a baby in this world?
…Hey, Aqua, start by explaining the situation. What happened to everyone after I left? And you should look at someone while you’re talking to them.
…Or would you want to be reborn as a baby in peaceful Japan?
Hey, listen to me. I’m asking what happened after I left. If you keep avoiding me I’m going to stick my fingers up your nose.
…Or would you rather live in peace in Heaven, where you will be free of dealing with troublesome companions, crushing debts, getting arrested, or other such hardships…!
…Kazuma-san, thank you for your hard work. Everyone who was there has safely defeated the Demon King’s underlings and are currently waiting and praying for your safety. The moment you defeated the Demon King, Senpai was transported here. And everyone who saw that, seemed to understand that you succeeded in your mission.
Right now, they are tending to their wounds after that fierce battle. They seem to be in some confusion upon seeing Senpai disappear, but…
…Now, Satou Kazuma-san, as the hero who died defeating the Demon King… I’ve been allowed to offer you another option in addition to the ones that people are normally allowed to take.
Option one, as mentioned previously, you can choose to live a leisurely life in Heaven.
Option two, I can grant you a body and return you to Japan. If you choose this, I can offer you enough money that you’ll never need to worry about financial matters for the rest of your life. And I can arrange for you to meet your ideal spouse… Hey, Senpai!? Y-You’re too close! Your face is too close!
And, option three, which would be to get your body back, and once again return to that world.
Now, which one will it be?
Please send me back to that good-for-nothing world that I hate so much.
Well, now that you’ve made your decision, we should hurry up and go back to everyone! Eris, do what you do with this and that, and send us back to the Demon King’s throne room. I’m sure they’re worried about me after I suddenly disappeared, so I need to go back to them!
…Um, Senpai, I’m sorry to say this, but, now that you’ve already returned to Heaven… As the goddess in charge of Japan, for you to go down to this world to play is a little…
Even if you give me those eyes, there’s nothing I can…! Ah, please stop! Senpai, please don’t try and rip out my pads! Really, even if you do that there’s nothing I can do!
…Can I ask a few questions?
I seem to recall some talk about granting me a single wish of any kind if I defeat the Demon King.
Hey, Eris, what should we do? I told him that because I thought that there would be no way he could defeat the Demon King. This guy is the kind of person who might seriously ask to become a god or own the universe.
I-I know he’s Kazuma-san, but even so I don’t think he will… Ah, but he might wish to live a harem life with all the beautiful girls he’s met…
Please give me a cheat since I didn’t really pick one when I first went to that world.
I agree to your wish. The Demon King might be defeated, but that world is still filled with strong monsters, so if you want to continue living in that world, I suppose you can’t go without that…
Ah…
Now, what cheat do you want? A powerful weapon? A strong body? Or perhaps an exemplary talent?
Does a Goddess count as a cheat?
Eris! Eris! Hurry up and revive Kazuma! Quickly! If we take too long, the others at the castle would’ve finished resting and gone back to town!
Yes, yes, I understand, so lend me some of your strength too, Senpai. We are reviving someone who has lost his body, after all… Now, then, Kazuma-san, this is a very special exception. It won’t happen again, so be sure to value your life in the future──
Enough about that already! Come on, let’s go!
Ah, Senpai! Oh, fine… Right, let’s go…!
Resurrection!
S-Senpai! This is all because you rushed into it! Hurry up and find some clothes or something…!
But-but I couldn’t help it! I completely forgot about it! Hey, Kazuma-san, you’re very bold right now!
P-Please wait a moment, I’ll get some clothes…! Here, Senpai, you hand it over to him! You’ve already seen it countless times, haven’t you!?
I don’t wanna, I feel like I’ll be devoured! Kazuma-san, you used to be so cute, but I guess you’ve really grown up now…
Oh, cut it out and just give me my clothes already! Just how long do you plan on keeping me stark naked!?
…Now, after this, you’ll be able to freely come back to Heaven at any time. Though, it doesn’t seem you have any intentions of returning anytime soon.
Yeah? Everything turned out alright in the end! If I didn’t promise to grant you a wish, the Demon King wouldn’t have been defeated anyway… Oh? Wait, couldn’t it be said that Kazuma was guided by a goddess to defeat the Demon King? I did weaken the Demon King, so I think I acted pretty much like a model goddess this time, if I say so myself… Thinking about it that way, aren’t I kind of like the MVP?
…Hey, are you insulting me? I was the one who defeated the Demon King. Do you get that? Kazuma the Hero did it. I’m the one who is going to become a legend. You are just the useless goddess who ran away from home and had to be rescued by me. So what are you even saying?
Oh? Do you realize that a beansprout NEET like you would’ve had no chance of taking out the Demon King without my help? In fact, I should be taking a larger share of the bounty on his head for my efforts. Yeah, 90 to 10 sounds about right. Also, now that I’ve returned to Heaven, I’ll be able to use the full extent of my goddess power from now on. So you better watch how you treat me, otherwise you might receive divine punishment.
I hope Darkness and Megumin aren’t worried to tears after seeing me vanish in front of their eyes. We should hurry back so I can reassure them!
Now, then, Kazuma-san… It’s time for you to voice your wish…
Hey, Kazuma, I want a glass of ice-cold Crimson Beer when we get back to town! Please be prepared to cast Freeze a lot on my mug. I want to hurry back and see Emperor Zell! He’s probably grown into a great dragon by now!
…? What’s with that strange expression? You’ve always looked a little strange, but now you look even worse off than usual. Do you want me to cast Heal on you?
Kazuma, welcome… Back…
Umm…
…Who is she?
This is the famous goddess, Eris-sama. I brought her with me as my reward for defeating the Demon King.
Eh!?
O-Oh, Eris-sama! You look just like the sculptures in… The church…
Whyyyyyy!?
Ah! How did you come down here by yourself!?
S-Senpai!? What are you doing!? You can’t come down to a world outside your jurisdiction without permission! Don’t blame me if you can’t get back to Heaven again!
Waaaaaaah! K-Kazumaaaaaaa! Waaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! Bwaaaaaah!
You really a pain in the ass, you know that!? I left you back there because you were getting full of yourself! I was going to go get you back after a while, so why did you do this you idiot!?
Hey~! I don’t really get what’s happening, but if the priest is back, please save Kyouya!
Yeah, he’s really hurt!
Aaah!? The Demon King’s army is teleporting back one by one! Wait, isn’t that the Demon King’s daughter!?
Hey, stop crying, we’re getting out of here! I can’t help that you’re already down here, so we’ll just deal with what comes next later…
Waaaaah! Bwaaaaah!
…Um… Darkness…san? Why are you looking at me this closely…?
…No, it’s just, I thought you resembled a friend of mine… 
Explosion!!
Megumin!? W-What are you doing!?
Explosion! Explosion!
Stop! Megumin, stop! You’re bleeding! Your nose is bleeding!
Fuhahahaha! I am the Demon King Megumin! I have taken over this castle and became the world’s strongest Archwizard! Worthless fools who dare approach my castle, witness my great power and begone!
Megumin, calm down! We just defeated the Demon King, so why are you bringing another one into being!?
Yunyun, I’m counting on you for Teleport. I’m completely out of mana.
Eh, erm…! I have enough mana for two trips, but… With the number of people here…
Oh, very well. Kazuma, please use this.
…You really shouldn’t push yourself like that.
I received such a valuable present from you, so I really want to give you something in return too… Of course, there seems to be someone who couldn’t care less about that.
Eh? Ah…! Me? Are you talking about me!?
Erm, everyone, please gather around. I’ll start teleporting everyone out!
Hey──! Heal up Kyouya before that! His pulse is getting weaker!
He’s barely breathing…!
…Eris-sama, have we ever met before…
O-O-Of course not! …Actually, what should I do from now on…
Teleport!
Sniff… Sniffle… Sniffle…
Now, then, let’s go. Kazuma-san, I’ll see you in Axel!
Teleport!
Eh!? What’s going on!? Why didn’t the Teleport work on you!?
Because…Sniffle… I resisted…Sniffle…!
You… Why are you always like this!? Even at the very end!
T-That’s not it! It’s not like that, listen to me!
I wanted to say something to you! It’s just, with everyone watching, it’s a little…
What is it? And now isn’t a good time to be having a conversation! Right now, countless enemies are flowing into the castle. There’s no telling when they’ll reach us…!
shortcut
…Hey, Kazuma.
What!? Hurry up and spit it out! I’m sorry I left you behind, but I really did have a plan to pick you up later!
Um… You know, umm… I’m not very bright, aren’t I?
If you want to bring it up, you are pretty stupid. But what of it?
…Well, I can’t find the right words to say this, so I’ll just say one thing.
Seriously, what are you trying to say!? Hurry up and spit it out already! You can hear footsteps, can’t you!?
Thank you.
Yo.
Kazuma-san… Good grief, why are you…
Phew, this place really is the best place to relax. How do I put it, I feel like I’m being rejuvenated just by meeting Eris-sama.
…Good grief. I had a really hard time after that, you know? Do you know how much work it took me to return here?
Well, I mean, you were gone by the time I got back to town. I was planning on giving you a lift.
Um, could you please stop calling me Eris-sama? You are the hero who defeated the Demon King, and you know my true identity as well, so you can drop the honorifics. And you should also use your usual casual tone…
Well, if you speak to me like you usually do, I’ll do the same.
…That’s how I naturally talk when I’m a goddess… Still, you look really worn out. What happened this time? After peace was restored to the world below, I haven’t had the chance to observe it too much…
…Well, a lot of things happened. Actually, I was kicked out of the mansion for getting a little carried away. I’m the Hero who defeated the Demon King, you know? It shouldn’t be too much just to ask for a few rewards more.
Sounds like everyone is as lively as ever… Did you run into any major trouble so far?
Yeah, they really are lively. Nothing really troublesome has happened so far, but… Well, I have a really bad feeling. For instance, recently, Megumin has been disappearing off somewhere with Yunyun quite often and coming back with a refreshed look on her face. She must be letting off her Explosion somewhere, but who knows what she’s using as her target this time…
As the great noble who helped defeat the Demon King, Darkness was granted new land to govern. Speaking of which, she has been complaining about receiving countless marriage proposals from not just nobles of Belzerg, but from all over the world too. Recently she has holed herself up inside the mansion to avoid meeting the messengers from the country.
adopted
And Aqua, who kicked me out from the mansion, refuses to let me back in. She keeps telling me to ‘Stop saying stupid things’ or the like, but even if she says ‘stupid things’…
Just what did you say to get her to kick you out?
I was being showered with praises and attention after defeating the Demon King, so I let it get to my head a little and made just a little joke. It went, ‘Alright, daddy’s making a harem’.
…Eris-sama, I do feel bad over that, so please don’t stay silent. It’s going to make me depressed.
Well, anyway, you can feel free to relax here until Senpai calls you back.
…Call me back? …Ah, I’m not dead, you know?
…You’re not dead? But aren’t you right here?
Well, yes. I came here by my own power.
I teleported here. Teleport. You know, I was here before the duel with the Demon King, right? I still had a spot open for my teleport destinations, so I thought…
!?
Wait, hold on a minute. You placed a Teleport destination here?
Yeah… I mean, come on, not even I would leave Aqua hanging here without a plan to get her back. By the way, do you think I can come here to hang out every so often? You know, when I get dragged into troublesome things…
No, no, no, you can’t! What are you saying!? And, you managed to register a Teleport point here? How could you do that? Actually, how do you keep doing things that no one else can even consider!?
W-Well, I just tried it as a test and it worked, so…
Come to think of it, Darkness has been looking for Chris a lot nowadays, you know? Actually, if she could just meet you normally, there’d be no need for this charade.
Ugh… If I meet her now, she will chase me to the bottom of it… I’ll find time to meet with her later.
Seriously, how could they treat the hero who saved the world this poorly? Right, I think it’s about time I go teach them a lesson!
First is the idiot who kicked me out. I was just a little soft on her, and it immediately got to her head.
Right, Eris-sama, I’m off to make them cry a little.
Have a safe trip. Don’t do anything too horrible to them, okay?
Kazuma-san, please hold on for a moment. You don’t come here very often, so let me give you a little present.
I wish good fortune upon you who have worked so hard for the sake of this world.
Blessing!
Kazuma, if you are free, can you go out with me for a bit?
If you want to do your daily routine, wait ‘till after we have lunch. If you need someone to be a witness for some duel you’re about to pick with someone, get Aqua who can use recovery magic. If you want me to follow you because something you want just came out, then go get Darkness.
That’s not it at all! Just what kind of person do you think I am!?
Do you want to go on a date… You don’t need to jump up like that! You gave Chomusuke quite a shock!
… Say, Megumin, you invited me on a date, right?
That’s right. Doesn’t it feel very much like a date when we walk together like this?
Yeah, but, those people who have been sneaking around behind us all this time are your classmates, right? You only invited me out to show off in front of them, right?
Well, it’s true that I want to assert my dominance over those sore losers who are at the age where they should be seeking a boyfriend, but it’s also true that I do genuinely want to go on a date with you, Kazuma.
O-oh… I see… Well, I’m fine with that…
You know, the dates I know consist of much more flirting. Like walking around with our hands intertwined, or kissing whenever our eyes meet.
I can understand holding hands, but if we start kissing in the middle of the street, the other adventurers will tease us, you know? …And, doing such things in front of my classmates is embarrassing…
Heh… Then, today, let’s show your classmates what you look like after ascending the stairway of adulthood. Leave it to me, I know a thing or two about such things.
Kazuma, whenever you get full of yourself like this, you always mess up, so don’t do anything unnecessary.
… Wait, did you just say ‘Doing such things in front of my classmates’? That means…
Yes, that’s exactly what you think it means! Come on, let’s get on with our date already!
… It’s only been a short time since I last saw you, but you’ve really changed since then…
What are you trying to do, Funikura? Are you not satisfied with just stalking, so now you want to get in the way too!?
I’m Funifura! Remember my name already! And I’m not stalking you for the sake of it… I came here to deliver a letter, and I can’t stand to watch you be lovey-dovey with him any more…
This is a letter from my parents and Komekko… S-Sorry, I thought you were just here to spy on me, so I tried my best to put on a show…
Y-Yunyun said that the two of you really are an item now, but I still don’t believe it! There’s no way you who had shown absolutely no interest in love could’ve beaten me…
Hey, enough about that already. Let’s be alone together so we can make out!
Why do you have to open your mouth at a time like this!? Okay, fine, I get it. Let’s go back home!
Uwaaaaah! I didn’t want to believe it, but it’s just as Yunyun said, the two of you really are an item now! You two are definitely already busy making babies!
W-W-W-We haven’t gone that far yet! Wait! Please don’t spread false rumours about me!
Thank you for attending my daughter’s birthday party. She has always looked up to you, Dustiness-sama, so I’m sure this was the best party she had.
It was my pleasure to be here. I envy you for having such a beautiful and adorable young lady. Now, then, If there’s ever the chance…
Dustiness-sama, are we heading back already? The party had to end early on account of the Marquis’s daughter’s young age, but isn’t it a little early for us adults to go to bed?
If you have time to spare, perhaps you’d like to join us for a few drinks. Of course, there’d be other noble ladies present too, not just us men. I’m sure everyone would be elated if you were to join us.
…No, my apologies, but if I’m late in returning, the people back home would worry, so perhaps another time──
I-Is that so? No, no, I’m the one who’s delaying you, so pardon me!
The Dustiness family is in charge of much of the internal security of the realm, so it’s only natural that you’re busy! Please don’t worry about it!
──I’m home…
Waaaaah! Darkness!
What’s all this the moment I come home? Did Kazuma scold you again?
That’s not it, listen to me! Kazuma is terrible! He went and snuck off to that pub that we promised to visit together when it opened by himself!
Hey, I didn’t sneak out to visit it! In the first place, we never promised to visit that pub together! And if a new pub were to open in town, of course I’d pay it a visit!
…In that case, why don’t the two of you just go to that place together. We could invite Megumin too…
Hah!? Even if you take me there, it’s not like you’d let me drink anyway, right? In that case, I don’t really… Yes, I’m coming with you! I’m coming with you to eat some good food!
…Hmm? It’s a little late to say this, but aren’t you wearing a really expensive dress? Did you head off to some noble’s party or something?
Hey, Darkness, you didn’t leave us behind to go to some glamorous noble’s party to hoard all the good food for yourself, did you!? Did you bring anything back? You must have brought back a box stuffed full of delicious food, right!?
S-Stop it, Aqua. Don’t pull on my dress! This type of outfit slips off really easily! And how would I be able to do that at a birthday party for a noble girl!? Kazuma, Megumin, please say something to Aqua too!
Aqua, do your best! If you cause a slip I’ll treat you to something expensive at the pub!
This man is really the worst! Darkness, hurry up and go to your room and change! Then we’ll all go out for a night on the town!
We often have meals together at the Adventurer’s guild, but it’s rare for us spend a night out together like this. Hey, Aqua, why don’t you teach this young lady some games? This way, when you come home in the morning after being out all night, Darkness would be a little more gentle in lecturing you.
Oh, that’s a interesting idea. Very well, this Aqua who is famous for drinking around in this town will teach you how to hold your drink in this newly opened pub!
It’s really unfair if everyone other than me is going to be drinking! I’ll be drinking tonight too!
…Alright. I’ll go change, so give me a moment.
Oh, yeah, make sure to dress modestly tonight. If you go to that kind of place wearing your usual erotic outift, some drunk man is going to come up and start trying to pay you.
W-What do you mean by my usual erotic outift! I always dress modestly!
I’m tired of being formal and putting on a noblewoman’s guise! Let’s go a little wild tonight!
Hey, Aqua, I need to ask you for a favour.
…Can’t you see what I’m doing right now? I’m taking a nap because I got sleepy after lunch. Don’t wake me up unless the world is in trouble or the heavens are about to fall.
If something like that was really happening, I wouldn’t bother coming to a simpleton like you.
You’re really lucky I’m in a good mood after eating my fill, you hikkiNEET. If I were in a bad mood, you’d be a crying NEET right now.
Oh, you sure have some guts, you Goddess of Naps. How about I turn you into a Goddess of Tears instead?
It’s not anything major, and you can go back to your nap once you’re done with it.
Well, if it’s not anything major, then don’t bother me about it… That was just a little joke, so don’t make such a scary face. If you do anything horrible to me, Emperor Zell who has now evolved into a high-level dragon won’t stand idly by.
If you’re going to use that chicken as your shield, then I’ll use this cat that is the natural enemy of chickens… Hey, why is she scared of a bird when she’s a cat?
It’s obvious that a cat can’t stand up against a dragon. That black furball fears Emperor Zell by instinct.
Hey, Chomusuke, don’t you have any cat instincts? Even a chicken is looking down on you, you know? Are you sure you are an evil god?
…Ah, I don’t have time to care about Chomusuke right now. More importantly, Aqua, can you get in the bath?
So you finally reveal your true colours, you brutish NEET. You don’t normally see me as a woman at all, but now you’re telling me to take a shower before seeing you…!
I’m going to smack you if you keep saying such stupid stuff. It’s my turn to clean the toilet today, but Darkness and Megumin came back covered in oil and herbs earlier, so cleaning it up is proving to be a pain.
What happened to those two to get them to come back in such a state? Are they trying to change classes to fried food?
The two of them went on a monster hunting quest together. Well, I’m sure it’s something stupid so I didn’t ask too much about it. Anyway, can you please purify the bathwater for me?
Do you think goddesses are some kind of detergent or something? If I’m going to take a bath, I would rather take one in a tub that has been scrubbed clean.
I’ll buy you a mug of ice cold Crimson Beer after you’re done with your bath.
──Hey, Aqua, you sure are drinking something nice even though it’s only noon. Darkness isn’t around, so do you mind giving me a sip?
This is my reward for cleaning the bath. In other words, I cleaned up after the two of you dirtied the toilet. If you want a sip, why don’t you start by apologizing for making such a mess?
Gurk…! I never thought there’d come a day when Aqua would be cleaning up after me… But I do want a taste of alcohol, so I’m sorry for causing you trouble, Aqua.
You can’t have that even if you apologize, Megumin! It’s still too early for you to be drinking alcohol! Hey, Aqua, get this! After we were done with the monster hunting, Megumin found a patch of herbs and did her thing…
W-What are you saying, Darkness! You were the one who was clamouring to keep that Oily Slime we found as a pet! Thanks to you I ended up covered in oil, too!
Aqua! You were playing around with the soap and shampoo again, weren’t you!? They’re all gone!
In the first place, Darkness, you are way too obsessed with slimy stuff! The other day too, you were gazing enviously at the piece of Tokoroten slime I got. You really shouldn’t play with food!
Even I wouldn’t do something like that! My body just reacted upon hearing the word ‘slime’…!
Hey, Aqua! I was planning to take a bath after everyone was clean! Go out and buy some shampoo and soap!
